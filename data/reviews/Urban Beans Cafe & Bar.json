{"text":"My soup and sandwich today were delicious although the bread was very dry. I did not get what I ordered but enjoyed what was brought and would have really been able to sit back and savor it except that the place is just plain grubby. As soon as I sat down I noticed that 3 of the 5 pendant lights did not work. Some serious cleaning and a little maintenance would provide a much more comfortable atmosphere in which to enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"I've come to Urban dozens of times to do work and meet people. The coffee is fantastic, prices similarly to other coffee shops in central Phoenix, and the atmosphere is great. Because it's open 24 hours, it's a reliable place to hunker down even during holidays. I've had various experiences with the food, but 9 times out of 10 I'm very pleased. The curry is my favorite for lunch or dinner, but the scones have also been delicious in the past. They tend to \"run out\" of ingredients, but they have a descent sized menu, so I've never been frustrated by it.  The one drawback is that alcoholic drinks are not cheap and their \"happy hour\" ends at 2 or 3pm. So if you're looking for a place to work a while and then have a cocktail, I'd recommend several other places, like Desoto downtown."}
{"text":"Great coffee and a good atmosphere. The also offer beer and wine making it a great place to grab a drink after work.  Dog friendly patio is always a bonus as well."}
{"text":"Although I've lived in the general neighborhood for my entire life and I have driven by Urban Beans probably 1,000 times, it wasn't until last week that I finally ventured in to give it a try.  I ended up going two days in a row.  Visit One:  The decor is not really noteworthy.  I'm not a furniture snob, I just know what I like.  Urban Beans is fairly cluttered.  My first instinct was to go with the strawberry scone.  It looked gorgeous.  Since I hadn't had breakfast, however, I decided to try the urban french toast (or whatever they call it).  It is a baked french toast and the description sounded great.  The french toast itself?  Terrible.  It was pretty much like regular toast.  Parts of it were totally dry and it had zero flavor.  It was actually served with real maple syrup (normally a plus), but it this case, a true waste.  I ordered an iced toddy because I wanted something cool.  It had a strange aftertaste.    Visit Two:  Today I decided to try a blueberry peach scone.  The flavor was OK but it was fairly dry.  To drink, I ordered an iced Americano.  This was an improvement over the toddy but still, not great coffee.  After giving it two tries, I really don't see a reason to go back to Urban Beans."}
{"text":"So disappointed! I used to always come here specifically for the caprices sandwich. Today I was served a hot mess. Literally a Caprices sandwich served hot. There's nothing more unappealing than warm shrivel up tomatoes. I also asked for extra basil, as I always do, which usually results in whole leaves of basil on my sandwich. Today it didn't appear to have any extra just thinly sliced slivers of basil laying next to the wilted hot tomatoes. Thank God their tabouli  is still to die for. I got my order to go and I should have none something was amiss when condensation was obvious inside the To Go box. And while the the thin strips of dressing on the outside of the bread may look good, they certainly make for oily hands."}
{"text":"So how was my coffee at Urban Beans this morning? Celestial! And consumed in a ceramic cup whilst aseat at the Lady of The Deerhorn Grape Cluster table...well, it is all good"}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm all about checking out new coffee shops, little shop and shit ya know? So I looked up 24 hr coffee shops and found urban beans and omf this place is just the most amaze place on the planet. They have a cute little sitting place outside and they have little water bowls for pups and stuff. Fuck, and their pastries. Like 20/10 and their smash ice coffee anything with coffee, yes yes yes. lmao yaaaaas, please come here. C:"}
{"text":"Their coffee is AMAZING.  The flavor is something that is so unique and delicious.  I usually get a cappuccino and it is truly the best one I have ever had and I drink cappuccinos every day.  One day I had their mocha.  Can you believe this, they make their OWN mocha syrup.  It is incredible and you can add as much or little sweetness as you want."}
{"text":"Great patio good atmosphere! The staff is pretty friendly. I would love to come here for happy hour [wine bar 12-7]. the chai tea is good. The only negatives: the pastries are a bit bland and the service is a tad on the slow side."}
{"text":"Best scones in town. Very relaxed atmosphere. Coffee is nothing that special, but the vanilla java smash is something special. Dog friendly cafe!"}
{"text":"I walked in here today and it was like a scene out of a musical. I can't even explain, everyone was so nice. They were perfectly cheery, explained all of their tea selections to me, laughed at my decision making process, and made me a delicious iced green mint tea.  I sat down at a table and made eye contact with a handsome stranger. There were actually a lot of handsome strangers, maybe a good place to find a date!  I smiled, put a little sugar in my tea, and was on my way, but not before ANOTHER handsome stranger held the door open for me and said he hoped I would have \"a lovely day.\"  So I clicked my heels, sipped my tea, and went off into the sunset."}
{"text":"Look I'm just happy about the hours. Of course there were a few minor flaws (long-ish wait, crusty atmosphere, not the cleanest restaurant ever) but I'm happy to forgive those. The staff was friendly and hard working. The food was really satisfying. As a vegan who's traveling thru phoenix for the night and needed a bite to eat when everything else was closed, this place was ideal. I recommend the jackfruit sandwich!"}
{"text":"I have gone to Urban Beans a few times and have always left satisfied.When I went today to get some breakfast, I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted. The gentleman at the counter recommend their special which was a poblano egg sandwhich. Omg....did that hit the spot! It was exactly what I wanted and tasted so good. Also as always my raspberry mocha was yummy and a perfect balance of berry sweetness and creamy chocolate!"}
{"text":"So this is my first time here and I had to wait over an hour for a sub par burrito. I can't believe that it takes an hour to make 5 burrito and have 2 of them be wrong. They never even bought up the fact that it was taking so long. They claimed it was the cooks first day. Who has someone start a day with no training what so ever. Dumbest decision I've ever heard. Burrito wasn't even good. It's really bland and oily. I will NEVER be going back to this place."}
{"text":"They don't just do amazing coffees, but they make the tastiest vegiterian breakfast/ lunch items! My fav is the pear brie scone n coffee :)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since they are open 24 hours to hang out and get coffee (or tea ) with vegan pastries but unfortunately the coffees and scones were less than desirable. So disappointed.... Staff was super friendly though ! Maybe we will try it again, it could have been an off day...."}
{"text":"Great spot! Spacious tables for homework or newspaper reading. Friendly staff. Turkey with brie is awesome."}
{"text":"Pro:  Good coffee,  locally owned, nice selection of baked goods. Consistently good attitudes.    Con:  Limited parking.     Give the national chains a rest  and stimulate the local economy.  Well worth a try.  Though I haven't tried the beer/wine options they look good for happy hour.  This place is user friendly in many ways."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop with tasty lunch and dinner options, very good coffee and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Urban Beans has a great atmosphere.  The music isn't too loud, there's always a place to sit and generally people are quietly doing their own thing.  They have a strong Wifi signal making it a great place to get work done.  It also has a great patio.  However, with street traffic sometimes the patio can get a little loud.   I've tried several menu items and keep going back to the Mediterranean Quinoa Salad.  Greens, tomatoes, cucumber and feta.  The homemade vinaigrette is light and refreshing with a subtle tartness that makes the salad a refreshing meal.  Urban Beans' espresso is rich and smooth. I've never had a burnt shot.  The iced coffee is light and smooth.  If you're like me and like your coffee a little sweet ask the barista to sweeten it as they make it.  The amount of simple syrup they add is perfect.    I really enjoy Urban Beans.  After passing it by for years, I finally went in and quickly became a regular."}
{"text":"We rolled into Phoenix late and had to catch a flight home the next day. We didn't think we'd be able to find any vegetarian spots open, so we were thrilled to find the Urban Bean. 24 hour vegetarian cafe? It was like an oasis in the desert.  Very chill, clean interior, and an overall welcoming atmosphere. Service was excellent, fast, and super friendly. We had the tacos: a bit small but very tasty, and a rice bowl that was also really good. Maybe a bit too much rice, but it was flavorful and perfectly cooked so I didn't really mind. We also got a smoothie that could have had a bit less ice blended in, giving it a slightly weak flavor. That being said, I am very picky and critical, and they definitely earned a solid 4 star rating. I'll definitely go back next time I'm in the area. You should check this place out."}
{"text":"Great coffee cool atmosphere close to things open 24 hour had the pastries delicious. They have live music sometimes also serving wine and beer and vegan foods"}
{"text":"We really love the owner and this place for the atmosphere and the attempts to serve the community well with good coffee and eats and the Art.   Well known, local artists work are featured on Urban Beans walls.   The last 2 times we've been in, my husband ordered some food. We waited so long for it that I asked the waitress what happened to it.  The wait staff were not busy had forgotten about his food both times.  Cold eggs, Ouch.  The 2 times we were in were varied in day of the week and time.   We may come back for the coffee.  It is wonderful, but won't take a chance on the food again unless they do not have to make it."}
{"text":"When im in Central Phoenix and looking for a pick me up that won't land me in jail, Urban Beans is the only place I get my iced coffee from. I guess it is slow brewed for 12 hours, and honestly you can taste the difference.  Also they support many local business's as well as purchase locally roasted beans. Staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. Great patio seating area right off 7th street and also a spacious interior, to work, study, meet, or just have a cup of your favorite beverage.   They also have a great little market area with tons of cool local companies products on display. Check it out, and stay away from that green place. Put your money someplace that actually cares!"}
{"text":"Best coffee shop (local or corporate) in town! Cool art on the walls. Chess board, wine bar, great staff. I love it! It's also right down the street from my house!"}
{"text":"Urban Beans is hands down one of the best coffee shops in the Phoenix area! I love going here to study and get a coffee since it is one of the only 24 hour coffee shops I know of. I have gotten the white mocha and peppermint mocha while I've visited, and they always taste amazing. The only negative thing I would have to say is that every time I've bought a baked good there is always a funky after taste in my mouth. I love this place so much though that I will still give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I was riding to work one morning and wanted a coffee. I knew about that corporate place on the corner of 7th St & Osborn and was about to walk in when suddenly, I recognized another option. One that didn't look like a fat cat owned it.  I stood in line and ordered a medium iced Toddy (cold-brewed coffee) with almond milk. The environment inside Urban is kitschy, eclectic and chilled. The people behind the counter are friendly and smiley. Service could be a little faster but the fact these guys stay busy is a testament to Arizona's love for local businesses.  I recently had a slice of quiche, not too shabby and full of enough ingredients that made me happy.  Keep up the good work! Will be by regularly."}
{"text":"Urban Bean is just my style!  I love the coffee, chai, iced tea, beer, wine... Uhh you get the picture!?!  The jackfruit sandwich is crazy good.  ***MUST TRY***  Scones, muffins, Breakfast sandwiches are so good too!    Every time I bring people here they love it!  Go here!  They are opened 24/7."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Urban Beans early Sunday morning (9:00 am).  We were happy to find it is dog friendly.  Tried to order the quiche but they were out (at 9:00 am on a Sunday morning?) so ended up ordering one of each of the breakfast sandwiches (reg & deluxe). Also ordered a regular coffee and a hot chocolate.  The gal asked me 2x if I wanted whipped cream and both times I said yes but it arrived with no whip and barely warm. Husbands coffee was pumped out of a pot and only warm.  The name is Urban Beans right?.   Sandwiches arrived long after the coffee and cocoa were gone.  The English muffins were not toasted and sandwiches were just bland.  I would understand f the place was packed but it wasn't.  Overall it was messy (crumbs on tables,  outside not swept....) We try to support local biz but next time we will choose another place to spend $23.  I gave it a 3 because it is a cute place, the baked goods looked awesome. I want to believe an espresso and a muffin would have been better."}
{"text":"I haven't had a yelp account until now, because I feel like too many people are quick to complain, and quiet to compliment. I always understood that if you didn't have anything nice to say, you shouldn't say anything at all. I'm about to say some very positive things.   I've been coming here for over a year since I moved in down the street. They're convenient, open all the time, and have good coffee. I'd eaten here a few times, but was never astonished by their food. Never astonished, that is, until tonight.   From what I am to understand, the menu is receiving a much needed overhaul. Look at my pictures for things to come. They've recently brought in a local chef, Nick. Surely, they spared no expense to get this guy to cook for them.   Some friends and I came in, all ordered different things from a list of recommendations by the guys beyond the counter.   The food was FANTASTIC! I'd have expected to pay double for meals like this. Lots of flavor, lots of color, and from such friendly folks.   I'll be coming in and eating a lot more often, needless to say. Can't wait to see these people continue to make food into art for my friends and myself."}
{"text":"Lovely. I come before work with time on my hands. The coffees always great and the brownies are really good (slightly lighter/airier than I usually like but these . . . I like).  Mostly though it's the vibe I appreciate. Urban it is and friendlier, it couldn't be while somehow managing to remain unobtrusive . . . Especially Vanessa who is pretty much there every time I go."}
{"text":"seriously, urban beans is one of my favorite spots right now...and has been for quite some time! their coffee drinks are amazing and you can just smell the quality when you walk in the door. their food, although you may not necessarily think to order it, is outstanding. service is awesome; they are so genuine and friendly! i think their food options are even on the healthier side... so A+ for that!   in addition, they hosted a series of wine tasting events, two of which i attended... so much fun! definitely look into their upcoming events when you can, as they take a lot of care in planning and making sure their customers are happy happy happy :)  a must-try!"}
{"text":"I decided after a long day to go read and eat the Rawco (raw taco) and could not be more pleased. Xhris was at the front counter and suggested I get it salad style with jackfruit. No Joke... It was the best salad I've had in years!! I kept thinking this is to good to be vegan, but nope it was and it tasted like an explosion in my mouth. THANKS Xhris for being awesome!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning to pick up breakfast to go.  There were about 8 people behind the counter and it took 20+ minutes to get the sandwiches I ordered. I ordered to go and they came out on plates. The woman returned to put them into bags and it took another 10 minutes.    I brought my sandwiches home to discover they aren't even what I ordered.   Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I like urban beans, my hot chocolate was gorgeous, needed more peppermint, but was good."}
{"text":"Continue to come for the atmosphere, coffee, wine, and fresh pastries! They're open 24 hours a day and have WiFi available :)"}
{"text":"It was not very busy, we were the only two in line at the time. I ordered piece of quiche and coffee. My friend ordered an omelette and coffee. The quiche was premade and should have been served up within a relatively timeline basis. My friends omelette came before my quiche. The guy just yells omlette, not with the 3 toppings he asked for, like omlette with tomato, cheddar cheese, and soy chorizo. My friend got a plate with just the omelette, no potatoes like the menu specified. So he asked the guy and he said Oh I'm heating them up. We get the potatoes and they were cold.   I asked about my quiche and apparently they forgot I ordered it. He said he will get it and it will be out in about 5 minutes. He brings it out, and told me to be careful because it is hot. So I waited about a minute took a bite and it wasn't very hot, it was cold. I had my friend try it and he basically said it was never heated. So I took it back told him it was cold. So he took the plate  and I walked away .  He came out about 10 minutes later and served the same piece that I had taken a bite. Um yuck, sanitary?? Not to mention that it was dry and still  not hot. The coffee was not very hot  and it was weak . I could have got three coffees at QuikTrip  for the price I paid for just one and they would taste better and be hot. Also, it is 42 degrees outside why do you have the air conditioned blasting on customers, 3 people came up and asked if she could turn it off. She was clueless on how to do so.  I think the health department needs to make a little trip to this restaurant. Not once have I seen any of the employees wash their hands. The lady at the register takes money and serves food."}
{"text":"We used to live across street, I miss this place I wish they had one in ahwatukee... Every time I'm around the area I stop for a hot late, I love their coffee and the cool place ...forget about starbucks!"}
{"text":"Boy, oh boy. This place used to deserve three stars... used. to.   It's such a bummer because it's local but shiii, what to do?   the owner is creative, a decent cook, but doesn't know how to manage a business! the second she turns her back, those girls are sitting on their butts again with their cell phones out!  The pros -- it's local.  --good location -- nice tea selection (but it'll run you over $4... so here we go with the cons..) The cons -- --it's dirty --it's overpriced, almost $10 for a caprese sandwhich, on small bread (but it's local) and some stale chips (again local) why would i go here to have a subpar experience with a sandwhich when I can go and get a better sandwhich at pane bianco? --why would i come here to experience, time and time again, dull customer service, sometimes even rude... when i can go down the street in 4 different directions to get better coffee and a better experience? sometimes the manager is upbeat but most of the time in a bad mood.. it's like dr. jekl and mr. hyde..  bummm"}
{"text":"Had a total shit day and needed to get out of the house. Even if everything had been average or terrible, the brunette girl that works the front is very nice and she was enthusiastic about everything. To the owner: she is awesome, make sure she sticks around.   I had been to urban beans a few times, but mostly for their eclectic wine selection (they have a bunch of good Washington state wines which are a little tough to find). Today was the first time I ate here. Iced tea and turkey and Brie sand which.... Well seasoned and came with an uber yummy side salad. I took the two top piece if bread off but that is just a personal preference.   I would like to add that this is the best time of year to use their outdoor seating (feb thru may). It is gorgeous out and even better when coupled with their excellent device and good food."}
{"text":"I found this cute little niche spot for lunch when I was working nearby. I was excited to have a variety of vegetarian and vegan options. I also like the relaxed atmosphere and artsy vibe. You order at the counter, and find a seat. I sat on the patio, as it was a sunny and balmy 68° . The machiatto coffee was really good with coconut milk . I ordered the Roasted Veggie wrap which comes out warm and with the tortilla grilled on the outside. When the plate was first put in front of me, I was a little surprised that it didn't come with a small side of hummus or salsa that typically accompanies wraps, and also missing was any side at all. No chips, grapes, fries, not even a pickle spear. Nothing at all. So it was a wrap on a big empty plate. I did ask for something for a sauce, and they were accommodating, and brought me some balsamic vinaigrette, and some vegan cheese they call Pleezsh. I will give them the wrap is delicious! The Pleezsh actually was the icing in the cake. It enhanced everything so much more. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area. However, I do think it is a bit spendy especially considering that there are no sides, and think that should be considered on their wrap or sandwich plates in the future. But, overall nice vibes, friendly staff, and great food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love to do work from Urban Beans.  We enjoy the coffee, the snacks they offer are always delicious, and the space is great.  My only complaint is the service, and it's only one barista in particular.  We get great service from everyone else.  Much like one of the reviewers below, we have had this barista just stare at us when come up to the counter with a strange look on her face, and she says nothing.  I decided to just start ordering when the strange look turned into a nasty looking smirk.  I've asked her about some of the food on previous visits, if she had eaten it, and she made another strange face and said, \"Uh, no.\"  This barista really creates a terrible vibe for our visits, and seems very unfriendly and rude.    We LOVE the place, for every other reason, but next work-session, we are going to try somewhere else.  I'm sure we will be back in though - UB is just too good in all other areas."}
{"text":"The ears to hear our order not so great. Latte not so great. Scones were okay.   Perhaps my expectations, and only visit, got the best of me."}
{"text":"I work in the area and drive past here everyday but never had a chance to stop in. Had an extra hour after work the other day so stopped in to have a cup of coffee and a sandwich. I've been back twice since. Drinks are great, food is great, perfect atmosphere to sit and read, catch up with an old friend, or just kill sometime with a glass of wine or cup of coffee! And the caprese sandwich is heavenly!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly service. It's a nice place to meet up with friends or get some work done."}
{"text":"Awww, so cute!  I was in need of some coffee and was in the area so I stopped into Urban Beans on a Thursday mid-morning. First of all, they have a very cozy patio with canopy style roofing and large bulb stranded lights (they weren't on because it was 11am).   The interior is larger than you'd expect. Counter with 2 bakery cases (chuck full of pies, muffins, cupcakes, brownies, etc.) side bar area, two seating areas (one medium with window seating, one large with couches more appropriate for longer period of sitting).   I ordered the caramel toffee nut mocha and a gluten-free red velvet cupcake, came out to be $8. Not bad. My coffee was a large and lemme tell you, it's very large. I'm gittery just typing this but in the best way possible. The cupcake was delightful, huge thick topping of sprinkled icing and a yummy, moist cake bottom.  The staff is very friendly. In fact, I was complimented twice in a matter of the 20 minutes I was there on my outfit so you know the staff has to be friendly if they're attracting such pleasant merchants too.  I will def go back here."}
{"text":"Urban Beans has acceptable enough coffee and atmosphere, but I'm always uncomfortable going there because of their payment set up. They have a tablet with the charge which, after being put in, is rotated over to the customer with the tip amount to be filled in.  When someone is serving me a meal or a drink at my table and checking in on me, that's one thing.  When they are just ringing up my VERY EXPENSIVE coffee or making it, that's another.  It's crazy to be pressured into opting a tip.  It makes me not want to go there.  I have talked to friends who feel the same way.  They are losing business with this policy.  Just leave a tip jar if you must.  Don't do this stuff."}
{"text":"Good lord.  I don't ask for much.  I ordered a slice of quiche and an iced coffee.  They didn't have to bake the quiche, just warm it up.  I waited 15 minutes and then went to the counter to ask for it.  The server looked confused and the Guy who took my order said he \"got lost.\"  I heard the server apologize to at least three tables (but not to me).  She told one guy the toaster burned his cinnamon raisin bagel (the last one in the shop) and insisted repeatedly that SHE didn't burn it--it was the toaster's fault.  Quiche was tasty, though.  The server said it was mushroom and spinach, so I had to wonder for a minute what the bright red things in my quiche were...then, I figured out it was mushroom and chard.  Coffee was \"eh.\"  The floor looked dirty.  There was a paper towel in the toilet.  Ok, I'm nit-picking now.  The place was moderately busy; the small private parking lot was full.  Fortunately, I was on my scooter, so I could squeeze into a non-parking space easily."}
{"text":"The service is terrible!  Employees look like they DON'T want to work here.  The tables weren't bused and we had to sit next to 8 hour old smelly beer for minutes on end before someone paid attention to us."}
{"text":"Good coffe and amazing muffins. Great place to sit down and relax."}
{"text":"My rubric for a coffee shop is pretty simple. The first and most important question is \"How's the coffee?\"  I ordered a regular drip coffee and the barista (who was very nice and eager to answer my questions) served it to me... cold. The hot drip coffee was cold. And it tasted burnt. Bad on two counts.  My cohort ordered an espresso and was served promptly. Unfortunately, his espresso was also subpar due to it's over-extraction.  The furniture was mismatched (but not in that fun, quirky way... more of a \"we stopped by a garage sale and this is what we found\" way). The light fixtures were interesting but cast shadows directly on the artwork. Typically, I'd say that's bad form. On a positive note, the concrete floors were nice, and I was partial to their rugs.  Their menus looked like a ripoff of Lux's glass window pane menus, but their merch area felt like a cross section of a duty-free airport gift shop. Pairing that with the chairs from various time periods and places, Urban Beans felt like it was trying to be several different shops at once.  If you try to please everybody, you'll please nobody."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I have a nice coffee shop within walking distance of my office! Though the location is a plus, the real reason I have become a regular is that they open earlier than Lux - 6 am - and have free WiFi. During a two month string of early morning test prep, the openers remembered me and asked about my progress on a daily basis.  My favorite part about Urban Bean is that ALL of their products are compostable and they run a compost in the back.   The only reason I didn't give five stars is because they have yet to add large tables (for two or three people to spread out books to study). Other than that - it's my fave!"}
{"text":"Came in here late on a Saturday night, just before a dance at nearby Brophy. The staff was very friendly, especially one girl who had great enthusiasm (or at least more than me :P) I ordered the Dark Chocolate \"Smash\" (what a fun name for their blended frozen coffee drinks!) While I waited, I was taken by all of the fabulous looking pastries and cookies in the display as well as the great, open interior. I was extreemly impressed with what was said to the owner's art along the walls. Anyways, back to the coffee drink... IT WAS ABSOLUTELY TO-DIE-FOR! After I got my drink my friend and I took advantage of the great patio and the cool (finally!) night. The only thing I could poke at, was that it took longer than I thought it would to get my drink, but I do realize that they are brand-new. What a great new spot! Oh, and P.S. -- I was surprised to learn that their cups made from corn biodegrate within 45 days! Now that's impressive!"}
{"text":"I first heard about this place via a tweet from @CenPhoTV, and since Urban Beans is located in my neighborhood, I decided to check them out.  I like the interior. It is minimalist, large, and well lit. I spoke with whom I believe to be the owner (I didn't think to ask, but she was very friendly) while my iced Americano was made. She informed me they will be open until 10pm (except Sunday's) and have plans to host live music events and small workshops on sustainability. Having another neighborhood coffee joint with late hours is always a plus, and given the size of the interior I could easily see live music nights working there. The place definitely has potential.  Now the reason for the three star review was the coffee. No new business, regardless of whether the owners have previous management experience, will ever rate higher than a three-star. As all things in life, lessons are learned through experience. Now the coffee wasn't bad, but it wasn't any better than say a Starbucks. This isn't a negative, only that with more experience I think the barista will pull a better shot and adjust their roast. Prices looked to be pretty reasonable. Food items are limited to pastries and muffins at the time, but I was told they have plans to bring in more confections and possibly even sandwiches.  The outside patio was shaded and nice, but depending on the time of day, the road traffic on 7th Street might be a little too loud to enjoy a conversation. There appeared to be plenty of parking, both in the lot and on the side street."}
{"text":"rude service! guy was too busy flirting with the girl that ordered after me that he forgot my order. fulfilled her order and then only after I had to bug them multiple times that he actually made my drink. very unprofessional. horrible service would never return."}
{"text":"The food here is great and the staff is amazing. The restaurant can be a bit crowded at lunch time but it's also worth the wait."}
{"text":"It is great to find a superb coffee place within my area. I can bike ride here once it cools down!   Lovely outdoor patio, nice and cool indoors. Bathrooms!! Excellent coffee drinks. Kind staff. Large and small tables. PLENTY of outlets. On and on and on. It is a down to earth cafe that will definitely stick around."}
{"text":"Going to Urban Beans in a highlight in my day.  Their coffee is excellent and always have fresh, wonderful food.  They obviously take great care in selecting their ingredients and provide plenty of variety. The staff is always friendly and courteous.   If you are looking for a great local coffeehouse, look no further than Urban Beans."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I typically only write reviews when I am impressed by a business. However, my experience here was so bad that I felt obligated.   First off, I looked up their menu online and thought it would be a nice place to take my girlfriend. Upon arrival, we learned that they had changed their menu and taken off almost everything we had picked out online. We found a couple things that could work for us, so when we were ready to order, they told us they were out.   This brings me to my next point. They were out of almost everything on their new menu. How does a business change their menu, and then not stock up for those few select items? (They were even out of to-go boxes!)   I ended up getting some sort of smoothie that tasted like barely flavored water. My girlfriend got an Italian soda, which she seemed to enjoy, but it was just ok IMO. She wanted a parfait - strawberries and curdled milk she got! I got a side of avocado and a side of eggs, which were actually palatable, but not for the price.   I would give this place one star, but the ladies working remained professional and polite despite our hangry disbelief.   Getittogether Urban Beans!!"}
{"text":"First of all, I ordered a smoothie. The menu says the smoothie comes with soy milk. I watch the employee add whole milk to it. I then ask if they added whole milk, employee proceeds to lie to me saying that soy milk was added until the employee who made it heard me and said it was whole milk. Now I am lactose intolerant, if the menu says soy milk is added, that's what should be added and not whole milk. After the mix up and after he made it again with soy milk. I go home and I ended up throwing up the smoothie. If I could give them zero stars I would. I will never be coming back here."}
{"text":"I feel like I came on the wrong day.  The kid at the register was very slow-moving and inattentive.  There was definitely no effort coming from this guy.  I ordered a sandwich to go and he gave it to me on a plate, then put it in a plastic box which started to melt on the bottom from the heat.    The sandwich was totally tasteless and generally not good.  It was definitely a \"waste of money\" situation.  My latte was ok, but not exactly competition for my regular hangouts.  I'll try it again if I'm ever in the area and looking, but definitely no special visits."}
{"text":"I stop by once a month to remind myself that, although close to my house, this place is still lame, poorly run and the customer service sucks.  If your playing on your phone when I come in, can you please wash your hands before rubbing them all over the lid of my coffee... which is average at best.  Oh and this is a new trend you may want to try, when I hand you my money, you reply by saying Thank You."}
{"text":"BOMB. So many vegan options. they have a menu as well! lots of seating and laid back vibe. the only complaint is that the service could have been friendlier and more informative (:"}
{"text":"I'm very excited about this place. It reminds me of a long-gone coffee shop in Sedona called Cups. No two chairs, tables, or coffee cups were the same. There was artwork packed on the walls made by local artists...all for sale...and the place was charming. But no more. It got bulldozed for the sake of a larger strip mall. Progress, right?  Urban Beans reminds me of Cups. Most of the chairs and tables are wildly different (some of the chairs are too wild...they are impossible to walk around which can be a nuisance if the place is busy), and there is some art on the walls available for sale.   The pastries are wonderful, and their menu items are fantastic. The coffee tastes wonderful, and I should know, because I've been in the industry for many years.   The people behind the counter are helpful and friendly. Can't ask for more.   The only critique is that the walls are a bit in a state of disrepair and the lighting needs to be tweaked a bit. This location is on the brink of becoming a TOP NOTCH place to go. Phoenix LACKS culture and art (First Friday is a laughable waste of time), and Urban Beans stands to be the game-changer in this arena.   Take note, Phoenix! Urban Beans is a wonderful hangout, and it poised to start a new trend in coffee shops and hangouts. I am exited to see what the future holds."}
{"text":"Amazing quality and tasting food, and excellent welcoming service. New favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"Hands Down THE BEST coffee spot. Their roasts are amazing, their customer service is unbeatable and they have killer pretzels (let be honest). There is no place I can go to get killer coffee without compromising a bit. Either I can find great coffee or great milks and sweeteners, not both! UNTIL NOW. I walked right in and got an americano with coconut milk and maple syrup! WHAAAAT!? And I didn't get a dirty look about it either. Today I got Americano with honey, almond milk and 1/2 & 1/2 with no condescension. And she even offered to steam it for me! So delicious. They are all so sweet and fun. GO, Please! Just GO!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Phoenix! We come here 3-5x's each week. They really know how to make a great latte. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, free Wifi, comfortable chairs, but the hot cocoa didn't even taste like chocolate, it  tasted like unsweetened almond milk. I will not be buying another one again! The chocolate chip cookies are good though."}
{"text":"Delicious and completely vegan. Not to mention this place is 24 hours! How can you beat that? If you're vegan then this place is a must try. Delicious desserts as well."}
{"text":"We were there at 3am in the morning. Impressed. Wanted to try something new in the middle of the night. Plenty of room to move around if it was busy. Clean, neat, and comfortable. The Patio was nice with different kinds of seating. It had rained earlier in the day and the weather was a bit cooler so, it was a treat to seat by/under the tress. Now, for the surprise. The coffee is really good. Had expresso and a coffee. This is one of the very few places that really has good coffee. The pastries look so tempting. Will be going back and having a pastry w/coffee."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today, which is silly because I live so close. This place was a dream for me. I'm a vegetarian and my options for good veggie food in Phoenix are so limited. I had the jackfruit bbq sandwich and it was awesome. More food than I could even eat. Plus they sell cold brew in sizes up to 32oz! Perfect. The girl working was so nice. I'll definitely be a regular here now that I know what it's all about"}
{"text":"Really happy I finally checked out Urban Beans last week.   Friends have been yelping about it (off line, not here; they're not Yelpers, that's why I used a lower case y).    Anyway I really liked it!   It's a serene atmosphere, lovely art on the walls.  My iced mocha was perfectly prepared.  I was very tempted by all the pastries, and simply had to buy a fabulous cookie, but brought it back to the store to share with Chris rather than add it to my waistline.    Everything looked really yummy.  One star deducted for the proximity of the hairdressers who stand outside and smoke cigarettes.     When will these people kick that nasty habit, yuk!   Ruins the atmosphere for me."}
{"text":"Coffee is actually pretty good. Loved the Urban Beans flatbread with Schreiner's sausage, which is just down the street (convenient). I liked the atmosphere and outdoor patio, very comfortable. I will be back for sure, especially for their wine hour."}
{"text":"This is my second time here.  It is a low key coffee house in the day and a wine bar in the night.  They have original artwork hanging up and funky chairs that look like you might impale yourself on (see picture) if you were inclined to throw yourself upon one of them -- you know, if you are having one of those depressing, \"i can't take it anymore\" days.  Anyhow, today I am trying the french toast (see picture).  They serve you home-made bread, 2 large slices and it is not overly sweet.  They also belong to the Belly Bites reward program -- nice touch.  The atmosphere is good to work in while enjoying a nice cup of coffee, latte, etc.  Good music too -- now playing \"Sweet Jane\" by Lou Reed -  RIP.  Oh, most importantly I forgot to mention the blazing fast internet they have here!"}
{"text":"Very good coffee. Places like this really makes Starbucks seem mediocre. I had an iced hazelnut coffee. Perfect flavor (not overpowering) and just the right amount of milk. They really know their stuff here."}
{"text":"I don't think that iced coffee should be $4.33. Call me crazy, but I can get way better customer service AND coffee for $2 at Dutch Bros."}
{"text":"I really like this place and it's awesome that they're open 24/7 but can you pleaseeeeee do some deep cleaning? It's SUPER dusty and there is old food in the corners under the curtains"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying, I have always loved this place. They have one of the best iced coffees in Phoenix and I love their farm egg sandwich. However, I was there today for a mid day meeting and figured I would try their lunch. I ordered the pear, arugula melt flatbread. The description sounded yummy, but it didn't live up to the menu at all. First of all, it was so drenched in the balsamic glaze that I couldn't really taste anything else. I didn't taste or see any pears at all (but my be due to the massive amount of balsamic glaze) and there was hardly any arugula on the flatbread- seemed more like a garnish than part of the dish.  The service was really lacking today. I think they were training 2 new people and the they seemed really confused and didn't even know what I was ordering- like they had not even looked at the menu at all. I will definitely go back but will stick to my iced coffee and farm egg sandwich in the future."}
{"text":"One of my fave spots in Phoenix.  Coffee is always on point. The scones are to die for! The pear and almond is the best!"}
{"text":"The hippest place this side of P-Town. It doesn't get better than this as far as social atmosphere with a side of alcoholism and coffee mania goes. Not to mention, they constantly host free open mic nights where some seriously talented people come out to perform/recite/incite/light the world on fire! Keep up the beautiful work, Urban Beans staff!"}
{"text":"I go because it is close to my house.  I like the service ,the space is nice& the baked goods are yummy.  But the coffee...not so much. Don't go if you want a reliably good cup.  There are some really good baristas and some that aren't that hot. They also need to change out their syrups. I had a flavored coffee in which the syrup had gone off."}
{"text":"They are always open!!!!! Right by my house so I can go there and sit on my computer, eat some scones or whatever. Very chill place."}
{"text":"This has become my \"when all else fails\" place to study and get work done. The location and hours cant be anymore convenient. Its a little loud though. Im not sure if the baristas are yelling their conversations or if the restaurant has a loud echo, either way you will hear their every word. I would still recommend it here though. Just bring earbuds!"}
{"text":"Came here to read and enjoy a mocha latte. Come to find out their beverages are pretty bitter (chocolate isn't sweet). Tried to sweeten it up with the guy working the counter, but couldn't get it done. Nice place to read and get free wifi, but wasn't a fan of the drink."}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome food, fun events and the best place to get some work done!"}
{"text":"It's open. Finally.  Yes, folks, my neighborhood at long last has its own bona fide coffee shop and not just a dubious Circle K.   Urban Beans, they call themselves. I believe when I told a friend the name, he called it \"jaunty\".  Take it for what you will.  Now obviously I haven't been sitting around caffeine deprived all this time as I've very much made myself at home at almost every coffeehouse in existence within a 10 mile radius (include the old CounterCulture Cafe on McDowell at 2 in the morning), but the fact that this one is 60 seconds away (instead of 240), is HUGE.  Ok, not really. But I could be a regular, if they play their cards right.  AND....? ----------- ATMOSPHERE: Fairly minimalist in setting. A bright open rectangular space with a lot of natural light; white walls adorned with modern art. All tables are two-tops and there are no couches. An outdoor patio overlooking 7th street that also has a few tables. Mellow downtempo music playing....  WI-FI? -------- Yes. Outlets, also yes.  FOOD? ---------- No cooked food prepared in store. Just pastries and quiche. Always the quiche, it appears. Pastries included bear claws, sugar cookies, and some humongazoid apple crumble death star thing...  DRINKS ------------ An array of your regular coffee beverages, along with a good selection of iced teas and blended coffee drinks/smoothies.   SERVICE ------------- A toss-up. I couldn't quite read them. Now, I was beyond stoked these guys were open. However, they were pretty much less than thrilled about my stoked-ness. I was firing all sorts of questions which I think to them just sounded obvious and rudimentary. Maybe they were tired? Who knows. Not the most inviting vibe, but I'll have to come back on a subsequent visit to be sure.   VERDICT ON THE PRODUCT? ------------------------------------------- My soy latte was done well, thank you.   And there you have it. Another CenPho coffeehouse. Ready for your perusal. And my caffeinated stopovers.  3.75 stars for now."}
{"text":"Pear walnut scone delicious. Hazelnut latte super good. Everything is Vegan. This place is awesome. My spouse got the Italian bake, also delicious. Open 24/7. Can't get any better."}
{"text":"Found out about this place at the 4th anual chili festival and when I saw they were open 24/7 AND had hot vegan options, I thought, \"can I just have my paychecks direct deposited here\" I even came the night after the fest because I was so excited! When I got here, it was lively and the people were very curteous  but they were out of like, every vegan thing on the menu.. They were even out of hummus. hummus... So I walked up and  told the girl I was just gonna pass but she then told me they weren't actually out??? So my gf needed to re-look at the menu and after 10 more minutes we were ready! I spouted my order only to be shut down as they were out of that item.... I decided to just get whatever as I've already invested 25 minutes into this fiasco. Once I got my food it was fantastic and an obvious labor of love on the chefs behalf, but was not what I ordered; instead I got what I originally wanted sans one component in place of a delicious chipotle concoction, I will come back I'm sure because I honestly don't care as long as its good, but I was somewhat underwhelmed. Maybe I caught them in a lul."}
{"text":"SUCH an awesome coffee shop!    Very cool atmosphere, staff is super chill and friendly, free wifi, great drinks and a scrumptious selection of food & pastries.  DRINKS:  For those vegans or with food allergies, they have Soy, Almond, and Rice Milk.  While the americano and cappucino are good, the Green Tea Smash and Dark Chocolate Smash with almond milk are my favorites!  FOOD:  I've  had the Hummus and Tabouleh, a Turkey Cranberry Sandwhich, and a Pear & Jam Flatbread that was all amazing!  Also, they have lots of Gluten Free pastries (GF cookies, biscotti, twinkies)."}
{"text":"First I ordered two drinks, and the man behind me ordered something more difficult than mine to make.  After waiting for seven minutes, I came back to discover that the barista finished his drink and hadn't even started on mine. She made mine finally, at this point I had waited over 15 minutes. I ordered a sweet drink, and it seriously was the most bitter drink I had ever had at any coffee shop. I don't even know what she made. The espresso tasted weird... So I asked her to remake it because there was no way I could drink any of it. This time I waited another 10 minutes for my drink, and I saw that she had used milk instead of almond milk like I requested. I'm allergic to milk. At this point it had been about 30 minutes since I ordered the first time and I was getting pretty damn frustrated. I asked once more if she could just remake them. I also requested a refund because of how long we were waiting. She finally finished my drinks about 45 minutes later. Get this. The manager or team lead guy came out and asked if everything was okay. We told him what happened, how it took 45 minutes to make a drink. (They weren't even busy, it was 11:30pm) and it took three times to get it right. He asked us if the drinks were fine now, and that if they were there was no refund needed. TERRIBLE customer service. Needless to say, we aren't coming back here. I don't recommend it. Go to Jobot instead."}
{"text":"We waited at least 5 min for the caramel apple pie and finished it at least 10 min before our mochas were even up.  On a Wed 3pm at the front counter was just the one barista who kept taking in more orders, dishing more pastries, and somewhere in between making a drink.    At pickup, my pal did say the barista was hugely apologetic (though we had not said a word) and proactively gave us 2 free drink coupons.  So very nice, sloooooow service.  Unique for a coffee place, can't wait to check out the \"Happy Hour\" nibbles and BYOB, yet for another day!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! The staff is very nice and it smells amazing in here, whatever they're cooking I want. The art is really beautiful as well and the layout is cozy."}
{"text":"This breaks my heart. Urban Beans, what happened?? The new menu is very confusing and some dishes I enjoyed in the past are now missing. The food has always been pricey and the service friendly but slow, but it was all worth it in the past. Now with the drink menu non-existent on the wallboard and the food menu radically altered, I'm not sure I will be stopping here as much :( And it's so close to my work...  The coffee is good."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop, awful bar. The drinks look good as listed in the menu, but no one there knows how to make them. After waiting a very long time for the drinks to arrive at our table (and watching several staff people try to follow a recipe and amateurishly attempt to crush herbs and mix and measure liquors) the concoctions we received were horrible. On the flip side though, I've been to this place for coffee and baked goods, and been thoroughly pleased. The patio and atmosphere are also top notch for either reading or quiet conversation with friends. All in all: if they stuck to what they know (i.e. being a coffee shop) they'd get 5 stars across the board."}
{"text":"This place is literally the best!! I can't believe I didn't know it existed sooner! First of all a 24 hour vegetarian restaurant, need I say more?!? Nicole makes the best sandwiches and pour amazing wine! She also has a rad personality that makes me want to stay and hang out. Then this was the first time I met Al but he definitely had some great customer service too. One of the best cafes in Phoenix with a super chill vibe :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their coffee here! The baristas make an amazing almond milk latte! The location is very convenient to me and I love sitting in their patio with my dog. It's great people watching and baristas are always friendly here. They do have tasty pastries too! The reason I give it 3 stars is because service can be a bit slow and the prices are a bit steep compared to other local coffee shops. Overall, coffee and pastries are great, but the prices are not."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been at a loss since we moved back to Phoenix after living in Seattle when it came to finding a coffee shop. Of course, we usually make our own at home, but we were downtown and went to the closest coffee shop.  Yelp didn't steer us wrong. All we ordered was coffee, iced coffee and an iced latte, and YUM!   The favorite has been chosen."}
{"text":"I went after work around 5pm. The place was quite with a couple of families inside. They had a very artsy decor with custom table tops and chairs. The iced coffee I ordered was ok and the tea my friend ordered was ok. All in all I would go here again. The interesting thing is the artwork was not to my liking and some of it was taken from comic books."}
{"text":"Really cool place. Great music. Free wifi. Tasty coffee. Vegan soup and beers on tap. Great service. Local company.  Apparently Yelp feels this review is shorter than most so I will add more words to appease the Yelp gods into thinking this is enough content. Now they are happy"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is that it's 24/7/365!!! It's hard to find vegan restaurants and most close earlier than regular restaurants. Service was great, employees were very friendly! Food was really good! We had the daily brunch offerings that were protein pancakes and chipotle burritos. Both were delicious! Coffee was great too and I love that they serve a 32 oz large! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, outside patio, cool workers and 24 hours? Unfortunately I asked for recommendations but since I didnt get one I ordered the wrong thing. A watered down dark chocolate mocha.  While thinking it doesn't have much flavor I was reading about how watered down the iced drinks are. My lesson? Read before ordering!"}
{"text":"I attended the Thursday night wine and dinner. The food was very good and wine pairings were awesome. The owner provided a great description of the different dishes and wines served. The service was impeccable and everything  made for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"As the French [apparently don't] say, Urban Beans coffee was comme si, comme ça. Maybe I can't give UB a fair review because I ordering a drink I've never had before, and it just wasn't for me. I got a latte with almond milk; I like almond milk on its own, so I figured it would be ok! No. Did not like it with almond milk at all and I didn't ask for a new drink because I had to get to work. A few more comments: the raspberry scone was dry, unfortunately, and the whole place is just busy with all the different chairs. I did love, however, the local and unique art on the walls, service was very friendly, and the space was bright. I will return, but this time get real milk! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent morning service by Andrew. Made a perfect Americano and the most excellent omelette!  Food here was fresh, excellent vegetables had a Serrano, onion, spinach and veg sausage omelette was top notch.  And this place is open 24 hours!  No more greasy spoons and bad coffee for me when I wake up super early!"}
{"text":"Extremely bad service this place needs to get it together. I was trying to place an order and the guy with the dreads was on the phone the whole time with his headphones on laughing and ignoring everyone. There was other costumers asking me the questions since the people that work there were useless. Super disappointed, ive given this place a couple chances and this was definitely the last!"}
{"text":"I used to hang out here and order to go often since its about a 3 minute drive from my house if I'm feeling lazy. Coffee is bomb. Breakfast burritos were solid, omelettes were solid, potatoes were filling, jackfruit delicious. I have had both really great, and less than average experiences here but the last time I came here I was super disappointed. I literally waited about 20 minutes for a breakfast sandwich, because Phoenix New Times was there, and therefore much more important than me (so I was told by the staff, the importance part being my own interpretation). Besides that fact, I was flabbergasted by what I was served. Between an english muffin was what must have been a single cold egg, topped with what looked like chopped/canned peppers, and a cold shredded cheese...For $8, and a 20 minute wait. I was too much in shock at the time to say anything. I was also still starving and had places to be so I scarfed it down and went to a drive through that at least had more than one egg on the sandwich. That plus this new menu stuff makes me hope Urban Beans works out whatever they're going through so that you can continue to be my go to spot, for food, coffee, and atmosphere"}
{"text":"When my husband and I first moved to Arizona two years ago, we basically lived at urban beans. They had a great menu, vibe and the staff was super friendly. Now, they are market style so not much food choices later in the day and nothing like the food they had before. The place isn't very clean. Most of the staff seems to be standing around not doing anything most of the time.   It's really disappointing to see such a great place go down."}
{"text":"Average, needs better seating( more comfy) - drinks average, only had an ice mocha - so their food may be good?    However, do they sweep the floors?  Very, very dirty - the topper was the wooden chairs had dust that settled in the lower seat area - dusting is must and sweeping and sweeping up mid-day is necessary. Probably wont be back...."}
{"text":"Great place with awesome vibes and good food. Best thing is they have alcohol with happy hour prices after 10pm."}
{"text":"Great place not only for their coffee, but for the atmosphere.  It is easy to meet people here and talk for awhile.  One of the sweetest little places in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting UB, the first being a year or so ago. I had forgotten that they are 24 hours, which I think appeals to many in the area. I also forgot that in the morning, headed north on 7th street, one cannot turn left into the parking lot. So after, maneuvering around the area, I finally arrived. Parking was easy and convenient.  Once inside, I was helped promptly and the employees began on my café mocha, offering to add a shot of toasted marshmallow syrup. This was quite nice but regretfully, I couldn't taste any of the flavoring in my drink. I didn't realize this until I was several blocks away and my drink had cooled slightly. I also ordered a dark chocolate mocha scone, which was tasty but a tiny bit dry.  The interior is a bit messy behind the counter but the seating area is clean. I enjoy supporting local establishments but UB doesn't have a welcoming vibe like others in the area.  While not my favorite, I plan on returning here instead of the Bux next door."}
{"text":"This was one of the many coffee places I used to frequent. This place is a gem. It's open late I think even 24 hours. Every time I've gone there, I found people chatting enjoying a beverage. Or a plate of food. They have very nice seating area. If you want to get on your tablet or you mobile phone; either work or chat. Urban Bean is great for both. Outdoor seating as well. Also they bake all their bakery items in house. With a good selection of vegan items too. Not only that;  they also offer food, sandwhiches, plates soups, stews and from my recollection alwdays some thing for vegans. And what I loved was every thing was made in house,; rite there in back . And they were always cooking up healthy concotiions. Always with the focus on healthy."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to try this place out and we were super disappointed. I have never seen such rude and horrible customer service. We mentioned to the lady ringing us up that this was our first time and she seemed annoyed. As my friend was ordering the drink they didn't have the syrup she wanted so she was deciding on another one and the lady rolled her eyes at us. Just overall HORRIBLE customer service! Coffee was not the great either. Only thing good was that it is open 24 hours but never coming back."}
{"text":"Really good iced caramel latte! My husband and Come here all the time when we need a quick coffee it's very local and close.. we can either choose Starbucks across the street or urban bean and we always choose urban bean!"}
{"text":"Sometimes the main dishes really, really good. Last time not so wonderful. But the pastry was. I'll be back... many times"}
{"text":"Worked around the corner for about a year anticipating this place opening. Finally got to stop in for coffee this morning (a year later) and had a piping hot Americano and a mango-poppyseed muffin. Big fan so far! Looking forward to having coffee on the patio when it's a bit cooler."}
{"text":"They have a great patio to sit outside and work, especially with a dog. They're also open 24/7, so I don't have to worry about being kicked out if I need to stay late.   But the food. Come on, guys. Why do you even have a menu if you're consistently out of so many ingredients? Every time I go to order food OR drink, I need to have at least two or three options in mind because they are, guaranteed, out of the stuff to make one or more of them.   It's gotten so frustrating, that I won't go to Urban Beans except for the patio during the cooler months. Copper Star has a great menu, always in stock. Lux has a full kitchen and bar, late hours, and they're always in stock. These places also rotate local art, Copper Star even offers jazz/blues music live on Sundays. There are just too many alternatives to Urban Beans to convince me to put up with this ridiculous stocking issue.  Urban Beans is a fantastic place to sit and work for a while, but don't come here for the food."}
{"text":"Urban Beans Cafe & Bar... Somewhere in-between Starbucks and Ultimate Hipster Coffee Lounge with a distinct leaning toward Ultimate Hipster.  *I love that this place features local art on its walls, most of it available for sale. BIG plus in my book. Music is decent without being too loud, which I appreciate.  **Unfortunately, when I asked for a pour-over, the barista had no idea what that meant, so minus one star from the coffee snob side of me; but the rest is a solid five-stars.  Food. My friend has been building this place up for days, particularly because of its delicious homemade pastries and diverse menu. I haven't eaten here yet, but everything LOOKS yum!  Oh, and did I mention that UB recently updated their hours to remain open 24/7? They're the only cafe I'm aware of in the area that does this. Major plus if they can afford to keep it up.  Ambiance is very relaxed. Makes a good \"work off-site\" location with comfy seating, free Wi-Fi, and even an outdoor patio for those more bearable months.  Coffee is nothing to get excited over, but I'd come back despite my snobby tendencies in that area. Service was good, too. Everyone seems to enjoy being here and you can feel that.  It's been a good first impression. I'd recommend it.  :)"}
{"text":"Gross. Just gross. This was my go-to coffee shop for a couple years (3-4 times a week), but it has gone waaaaay downhill.   I still stop in from time to time because it's the only place I'm aware of near me that makes gluten free vegan scones. Their coffee is crap, so I don't even bother with that anymore.  Last week, the girl who grabbed my scone used the tongs she had just used on the regular pastries. You may think \"No big deal\", but it is to me because I am allergic to wheat.   I said nothing and have the scone to my boyfriend. Today, I went for a scone and decided to try an iced dirty chai again too. First, the chai is not chai....they use Monín chai flavored syrup. Needless to say, it sucked.  Then, the kid making my latte WIPED SNOT FROM HIS NOSE TO HIS FOREHEAD WITH AN OPEN PALM and continued on making my latte!!!!! No washing hands, excusing himself to blow his nose, nothing. He could've at least used his sleeve??!! While this was going down, the girl frosting a cake behind the counter told me she licks the icing off of her fingers when she bumps the cake.  I asked her to grab my scone because snot wiper forgot. He threw on his hoodie and walked out the door.   I guess it was the lesser of two evils, her grabbing it rather than him.  I forgot to mention that there were balled up, dirty napkins on the table where the coffee lids and straws were.  I was so disgusted by the whole transaction that I couldn't even eat the scone. Not giving my money to this dump again."}
{"text":"Such a cute place with a great selection!  Very comfortable setting and the Dark Chocolate Frozen Mocha was delicious!  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Polished concrete floors. Mismatched wooden furniture. 32 chairs inside. 8 chairs on the 7th St. facing patio.  Stark white walls with local art -- the two owners are the first to show their work.  Pastries brought in from a number of local bakeries.  A glass menu board.  Free Wi-Fi with password.  I ordered an espresso macchiato my two times in and got two different prices ($2.50 the first time, $1.30 the second).  I was told today when I picked up my order that the cashier (owner?) rung up the order wrong and next time the price would be correct.  No big deal.  The coffee is not Lux nor Copper Star, but I'd put it on par with Drip and Fair Trade.  Not a complex taste, but it does the trick.  Not a lot of action in here either visit.  One or two people at any given time over a few hours.  The music is hit or miss, but volumed well, and unobtrusive.  One of the barristas mentioned that they'd like to serve beer/wine some day and they have the makings of a walk-in cooler, replete with pounded copper door.    Indeed Phoenix could use more places where city dwellers drinking coffee can sidle up next to someone drinking a beer."}
{"text":"Updated menu for food so all the items they have are itemized with descriptions! They also have happy hour from 10-2 am and pm and breakfast on Saturday and Sunday from 8am-1pm"}
{"text":"The Urban Scramble breakfast is great!  The staff is friendly and they remember my order every time I walk in!"}
{"text":"Coffee is great but they don't have Splenda.  I asked the person behind the counter and they said we have stevia. I explained that stevia least a nasty aftertaste and they said we only carry all natural products. I would say that the pastries that are in your display case beg to differ."}
{"text":"I worked at Urban Bean for a summer a few yeras ago and absolutely loved it.  One of the main appeals for me was how \"green\" the place was.  The to-go cups are biodegradable, the coffee is local and organic, the pastries are baked on site, the used coffee grounds are composted, and the extra pastries are donated.   The drinks are quite tasty as well. Although I haven't been in a while to try newer items, all of the classic stuff is delicious! I also recommend the cardamom cake if it's still offered--it tastes like a chai tea in cake form. Yum!"}
{"text":"I definitely prefer this place over Copper Star Coffee. While the location is a little out of the way, Urban Beans is a decent coffee shop with lots of space, free wi-fi, and decent coffee. It's not the best in town, but it gets the job done. They've got a decent selection of pastries and light lunch foods, and also serve smoothies and other icy treats, which are definitely welcome during hot Arizona summers. The people are nice, but not all of them are very keen on the coffee stuff. They're also right next to Bards Books, which makes for a good one-stop shop for a nice afternoon with yourself. Prices are okay, hours aren't too late. Reason why this place scores better with me than Lola Coffee: they don't burn their coffee. Automatic win."}
{"text":"No hippies here!  I have nothing against hippies. I love them actually but do you ever feel like every coffee shop is just littered with them? I mean, do you just hang out here all day and take up valuable creative space? I needed to find a coffee joint that was quiet, served kick-ass coffee and baked goods and a comfortable place for me to work.   I found it!!!! Urban Beans is my Easter egg. I was scared this might be one of those ultra modern, cold, coffee shops but while the decor is minimal, the impact it made felt like a firm hand shake that said, \"Come in, stay for a while.\" And that's exactly what I did.   There are so many tables here. No couches, which I thought I would miss, but I actually don't mind. All the chairs are different at every table which gives it an organized antique look. The area rugs bring warmth to it as well. I am set up next to a window, watching people and cars pass by as I \"work.\"  There is also a covered patio for nice days. I can't wait for the weather to warm up a bit so I can try that out.  I ordered a toffee nut mocha and bought some home made toffee. The coffee came to me with a cute foam feather and a tasty coffee too. Not sweet and was a strong coffee. Exactly what I needed.   The toffee is sooooo addicting. A caramel, buttery chunk with nuts and covered in chocolate. I can't wait to try the other cakes and muffins here too.  I commend Urban Beans for making this a great escape from the day."}
{"text":"Some of the best scones in town, and I'm a pretty hardcore scone enthusiast. The staff is always friendly and the place has a nice atmosphere for just hanging out."}
{"text":"Not too quick with breakfast food so be prepared."}
{"text":"This place is simply great! The coffee is marvelous and the atmosphere is so relax. The 24 hour  schedule makes it even better. I go there frequently and I have not been disappointed any of the times I have gone! If you are looking for a relax and nice place to study go to Urban Beans Cafe and bar!"}
{"text":"24/7 vegan. Say no more. however the menu is limited as the night grows old. i also guess service is pretty non-existent at 4am. but considering the options, this definitely was better. willing to go again during day to experience the whole package."}
{"text":"The place is dirty.  Everything.  From the floors to the counters to the restroom.  I ordered my food hesitantly but I was starving and was there.  I went to the restroom and went back out and cancelled my order.  There was no way I was eating something from back in the back where I couldn't see when they didn't care if the restroom that I could see looked like that. There were 2 employees standing around.  My word....get to work.   The place was empty and plenty to do but evidently they weren't up for it.  I will never go back.  Its also very run down.  When there is places like FAME and LUX,  you don't need to patronize places that maybe had their day but now they are just done, or look like they should be."}
{"text":"I really like this place, the food is good, and tastes more than home cooked than restaurant. Definitely a small scale operation.  The service is not just friendly but the guy that was working the counter was so genuinely happy he was cracking jokes and singing! I just had to smile. They're open 24  hours so if you want late night vegan after a night out this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I drive past this cafe on the way to work. I started stopping in because it's so convenient. First, the good. The baked goods selection is nice. The feel of the place is hip/trendy (maybe a little cluttered. Not sure what the deal is with the wine bar) and they have a decent patio out front where the traffic noise from 7th St gets decently muffled by trees and the surrounding wall. The folks who work here in my experience so far are genuinely nice and take their work seriously. Early morning crew better? The bad. The service can be really slow at times. The barristas do take their work seriously, but sometimes the supurfluous chatter causes back-ups. I really want to like the coffee here, but it just tastes, well, bad. I'm not some kind of java expert but I know when my palate is unhappy. I've tried many different brews and types trying to find a happy compromise, but to no avail. In addition the prices are a bit on the high end in my opinion. Depending on your choice of coffees, the \"large\" ends up coming in a medium cup. Weird. The killer was when tried an iced toddy and couldn't finish it. Surprisingly acidic. Again, I really want to like this place for all the good reasons, but...."}
{"text":"Love that this place is open 24 hours and they have different options, but the staff is extremely hit or miss. Today I tried to call in an order and pick it up. First, the website menu was old and the person that picked up the phone was new and couldn't even direct me to a vegan breakfast choice. The other lady gave me 2 options and after an awkward exchange asked how long I would be. Normally I get a \"it will be ready in 15-20 minutes\" when I call in orders but not here. I showed up and wanted to confirm one burrito was vegan since the new menu at the store only said eggs and cheese. The new girl had no idea and another lady with purple hair seemed too busy to care so just gave an annoyed thumbs up. I've been here before where other employees have no idea if coffee or other menu items are vegan, and have even seen one belittle a young female employee in front of the whole restaurant for about 15 minutes while I ate. Great food, spotty service, and never know what you will get."}
{"text":"just found this place, love it. not too full, great quality food (had jack fruit chipotle burrito- who else would serve that?great btw) and drinks were good. service was good but slow, again quality. I don't mind. they also have alcohol , I have not tried."}
{"text":"Urban Beans is reliable, consistent, and a great option for healthy eats, great coffee at ALL HOURS, and a local business! I am always greeted with a smile and wonderfully friendly service here, which can be hard to come by and is appreciated."}
{"text":"We came in late after an awful experience downtown. We were grouchy and looking for real food. Let me tell you these guys delivered!! I had the pumpkin curry with quinoa and my friends had some of the breakfast burritos. Everything was made fresh from scratch, and delivered with a smile. The bar was stocked with homemade Sangria and top shelf whiskey. After our meal the dude brought out warm pretzels with 3 dipping sauces! Awesome art on the wall, and they were playing some great tunes. A must stop if you like real food and real people, thanks for saving our night xoxox Jason Lee and the Riptides"}
{"text":"As much as I come hear and love the convenience of the 24 hour Cafe I would note that the WiFi is super slow. It's annoying when I'm working on something super important for work and the WiFi slows down or goes out completely. I would suggest to the owner in investing in Fiber Optic Internet."}
{"text":"The most awsome interject coffee bean shop on planet earth! This is something out of ordinary from a normal coffee shop. A plethora of beans and roast to choose from. They have cozy and plenty of seating.The staff is friendly and prompt. I highly recommend this gem to any true coffee lover,give this spot a shot. I will be returning here again soon!"}
{"text":"This place needs to make up its mind! Sometimes they're coffee shop sometimes they're a restaurant and sometimes they are a wine bar. I think they've tried music venue/art gallery as well. They do none of these things with excellence. The coffee is fine, often bitter or weak. The staff can't be blamed, since they are not trained as baristas. Dont order dinner, i've tried several things and nothing is great but it's all more than $10. Honestly I come still from time to time because the place is so conveniently located and every time I go I regret it (I never seem to learn, I go three times a year and its been like 5 years). If you want to be a coffee shop be a really good coffee shop, if you want to be a bar be a really good bar, if you want to be a restaurant be a really good restaurant! Pick one, and focus and do it well!!"}
{"text":"Urban beans has a great staff and quality coffee. The overall vibe is very relaxed. I always go here to read and chill at 3ish in the morning. They have a great happy hour from 10 p.m to 2 a.m too. Its worth giving this place a try if youre up late and in the area. Its most definately better than starbucks. As a side note, I dont understand why everyone bags on there decorations. I think theyre cool. The chairs are totallycomfy."}
{"text":"My banana walnut was stale and tasted like a cardboard box. The peanut butter cheese cake tasted spoiled and the lemonade was warm and bitter."}
{"text":"I have been going to this wonderful place since they first opened. They are consistently wonderful. They have the best scones I have ever tried in Phoenix (and I have tried A LOT). Although I love Luxe also, their scones are nowhere near as moist as Urban Beans!!! All that being said, I tried a gluten free scone last week and it was awful. It literally tasted like cardboard- at least how I imagine cardboard would taste!!  Unfortunately, on the same visit the order taker wasn't paying close attention to my order and so I got a latte that was wasaayyyy sweeter than I like. I hope Urban Beans reads these reviews because their order takers (at the counter) could use some improvement- friendliness and details.  All that is very minor when considered with the whole picture. And I would whole heartedly recommend this place to my fellow picky espresso drinkers out there!"}
{"text":"I strayed from my usual coffee bar, Luci's, to try out Urban Beans because I had a groupon burning a hole in my pocket.  My sister and I ordered a caramel toffee nut mocha, iced green tea/lemonade combo, and a slice of quiche.    Neither of us particularly loved our drinks... they weren't bad, but they weren't anything that we would ever crave.  And, considering that we both constantly crave the green tea/lemonade at Luci's, it just didn't seem like it was worth going out of the way to return here.  On the plus side, the quiche was fantastic.  Light, fluffy egg/ham filling on tender crust.  Lovely for a morning snack.  While I liked the eclectic, mis-matched chair thing they have going on, I felt like the interior was lacking something.  Displays weren't as visually attractive as I would expect, and the vibe was kind of boring.  Ah, well... back to Luci's!"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my favorite coffee shops close by work and on my way from early morning classes. You've gotta try their Vanilla Java Smash or their Green Tea Smash. Absolutely delicious, creamy, and not too sweet. Their setting is amazing and it's a quiet place to chit chat or enjoy yourself. The baked goodies look amazing and most are vegan. They've got a great variety for everyone. Try it!"}
{"text":"Best scones and urban scramble breakfast!! Love this place!  I eat breakfast here everyday!"}
{"text":"2 stars= 1 block from my office! 1 star= urban hipness 1 star= actually tasty bran/raisin muffin and good chai.  Good luck Urban Beans!"}
{"text":"Urban Bean lives at the top for as a coffee ( and afternoon craft ) stop. The espresso pulls are always on, the staff chat you up and the space is that perfect level of comforting white noise to hang/work/read in"}
{"text":"30 min wait for a Caesar salad wrap?!?! Unacceptable. Matcha green tea smoothie and coffee was good which saved them from losing all stars"}
{"text":"Got a Southern Tropic Smoothie tonight & it hardly had any flavor at all. It's not sweet at all & with all the fruit that supposed to be in it, you can just taste milk. I would think for $6 for the smallest size it would be better. Definitely not trying this place again."}
{"text":"Granted it was 5 PM when I ordered it, and it was the last one, the blueberry scone I had was average at best. I can't say it really tasted like blueberry and the texture was the expected dry of a scone. My iced mocha was alright. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I greatly enjoyed this place. Polite and friendly staff. Nice mix of deserts, teas, cofee and even wine and beer.  Nice atmosphere. Will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. First, it's open 24 hours so I can go there to study no matter time -which is wonderful since burst of energy to study come at various points during my day. The coffee is delicious. I had a caramel latte and it was delicious and beautiful. The staff is super friendly and personable. I will say that the seating isn't the most comfortable and finding outlets for your computer is at times challenging.  I've had coffee, baked goods and tea from here and I've enjoyed all. You will get a unique group of people depending on the time you go, but that adds to the fun and ambiance of the place. Oh, and best thing...I can study and have a beer at the same time. While some may see this as counterproductive it can help to clear the mind and reduce anxiety (my own opinion). Definitely check this place out for coffee, studying, relaxing, or whatever. I think you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Phoenix seems to lack good coffeehouses in general (hey, I'm from the Northwest, and am accustomed to many good coffeehouses sprinkled all over town within blocks of each other), but this one I like.  I tried Copper Star, Fair Trade, LUX, Lola, and Conspire during the year and a half we lived there and none provided the atmosphere of a true coffeehouse where you can relax, listen to music, converse with friends, and maybe view some local art while chowing on a healthy snack...except Urban Beans.  The owner works the counter, is conversational and friendly, and really enjoys what she does.  The coffee shops in Phoenix tend to be so small that the enjoyment of the patrons really seems like an afterthought.  Every coffee shop we visited (except Urban Beans) had no seating room.  Kids (I use that term loosely...think 23 and under) bring in their laptops, order a drip coffee, and sit all day long taking up space that others could be using while enjoying a coffee. The kids who work at the coffeehouses don't seem to care because it's their FRIENDS who are hanging out on the couches the entire day.  Urban Beans is for grown-ups and for people who want to experience good coffee in a friendly atmosphere, while nibbling on a salad, then continuing with life elsewhere after an hour or so of kabitzing.    Gawd, I sound old! :)"}
{"text":"How can you not love a local coffee joint that hits you with a deadly combination of premium beans, 24/7/365 hours, scrumptious food, and wine? You haven't lived until you have visited Urban Beans - that's the bottom line. I regularly come here for an unusually large iced coffee and amazing breakfasts. I love how patient and friendly the staff is to customers and I particularly enjoy the rotating local artists' work they display on their walls. This local hotspot is truly a gem of our community - I can't even imagine the neighborhood without it!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent at Urban Beans for good reason.   One reason I continually come back to Urban Beans is because of their delicious drinks and pastries that are dairy and gluten-free. UB makes the best almond milk London Fogs in town. They are rich, and composed of quality ingredients.   Another reason I love UB, is because of the quality of their pastries. UB continually introduces new eccentric items to their menu are always delectable. They offer an array of gluten-free and vegan options.   Finally, the employees at UB are polite, and experienced. Simply put, they know what they are doing.   Lastly, my only critique of UB is that they revisit their WIFI set and seating arrangements. Trying to access their WIFI is the equivalent of breaking into Fort Knox, that is, not easy. Moreover, they just need more seats with a table. There are too many here for everyone to sit comfortably at a table, especially if you're with a group larger than 5.   Nonetheless, please come to UB, I promise you will not be disappointed and they will come through on all of your gluttonous desires."}
{"text":"Just checked this place out since I recently moved right down the street. They must have heard that people were having a poor experience with regard to service because the guy helping me out was really friendly and talked with me for a bit about the different teas they offer.   I saw that they also offer food/wine tastings on certain nights. The chef who coordinates this was also the barista who took my drink order.   I agree with everyone that says the interior needs some renovation. I like the bright open space but some reading chairs and more wall decoration would certainly spruce the place up! All in all, it's a close, locally owned place that I'll be sure to stop by again when I need to."}
{"text":"I so want to love and support local coffee bars. With a Starbucks on the same block, I wish I could say I'll be choosing Urban Beans in the future. Unfortunately, I won't be frequenting this place.   The atmosphere is adorable, and the location is very convenient. The sweet female barista made me a \"surprise\" latte when I couldn't decide, and it was delicious! However, after waiting over ten minutes for my quiche to warm up, I approached the gentleman behind the counter. With a massive attitude, he told me it's \"not coming up because I don't see any tickets behind here a quiche on it. Go talk to her.\"  Oh, I'm sorry. Did my being a customer interfere with your ability to do your job?  I'm just sorry I left a 15% tip before all this happened.   Want a decent latte? Feel free to go to Urban Beans. Prefer good customer service? Head to Starbucks."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. We had the cauliflower bisque (it was okay), a caprese sandwich (very good) and black current tea. The atmosphere was a bit Dobie Gillis, which was part of the charm."}
{"text":"I love the variety of food and drinks they have here. Nice and cozy environment, very friendly. Also love the artwork on the wall. This is the kind of place I would like to hang out with a nice drink and a book or a sketchbook. I am also very thrilled to learn that dogs are allowed on the patio! I'm definitely coming back with my dog (and the rest of my family too!)"}
{"text":"Very poor staff, simply just unprofessional. Not acknowledging customers, having loud obnoxious conversations behind the counter, drinking a beer on the job, really?! Only been here a few times and had the same experience each time."}
{"text":"I go to Urban Bean a LOT for coffee.  My husband and I have hit lunch there a couple times.  Just invited two friends for happy hour after being told by a worker that wine is $5.00 a glass, draft beer $3.00.  Our bill came  -  YIKES!!!   First our waitress didn't give us any happy hour price on our wine and then we find out that it's $5.00 on 'certain' glass' and $1.00 off the others.  I tried to use my Belly points, but they amounted to a big FAT ZERO.   No one even thought of giving us what we were told, so I guess with all the fantastic happy hours out there, I won't be back.  Sad that business' don't care enough to keep a happy customer insert a sad face here."}
{"text":"My favorite cafe in the Phoenix valley! It's just the right amount of cool vibes but still relaxed and not pretentious. Great selection of different kind of drinks and food too. Perfect for studying or just hanging out."}
{"text":"Nice place, like the coffee.  Lots of snacks and baked goods too.  Could double their business by getting comfortable chairs."}
{"text":"Overall, love Urban Beans, especially that it's open 24 hours.   5/5 for the community friendliness, environment, cafe design, and atmosphere.   3/5 for the inconsistent quality of coffee and food (and sometimes service). I live in the neighborhood and visit UB at least one a week. Based on the taste alone, I would never know if I was at the same coffee shop. One example is the hot Mocha. At best, it doesn't taste like chocolate at all; at worst it's like drinking cardboard dissolved in water. Please UB management, test out a new mocha espresso recipe."}
{"text":"Update:   As I continue to frequent this place, the customer service is increasingly erratic and the food less fresh. I can't even describe how one of the women tried to get the bottom of the brew into my cup and then when not full, starting taking drips from a fresh pot being brewed and adding it to my cup. By the time she finished, I had lost my appetite for the cup she prepared. Ew! I have to downgrade my original rating because of too many disappointing visits. It's a shame as it is not well managed and customer service training clearly lacking.  Earlier review: Adorable local coffee shop with an interesting array of local art on the wall. You'll know you've arrived when you spot the Ducati bike outside. I usually just get their coffee, which is always great, but they do serve lunch and breakfast, especially muffins and pastries. The only downside is that sometimes service is a tad slower than you'd like."}
{"text":"First visit here and I'm pleasantly surprised!  Great breve cappuccino and I just love when they decorate the froth!  I can't give it 5 stars because it just wasn't THAT impressive but I'll certainly return."}
{"text":"Great Local business. Casual, cool, calm atmosphere. Great chill vibes and great service. From there iced teas to there blended beverages, service was A+! Another positive highlight is they are open 24hrs! Support your local businesses and come take a gander."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here a handful of times and keep coming back because of the atmosphere.   Coffee is pretty much coffee everywhere. I've been to several and they're all pretty much the same. That's the case here too.   But the reason this place is great is because of the vibe. It's a spacious room with white walls, mismatched chairs and tables.   It's a good place to come and chill out. It's very quiet and laid back.   I did have the red velvet cupcake they had once before and I wasn't a fan. But it wasn't terrible.   I like to meet up with one of my friends here from time to time. The patio is nice, but it's alongside a busy street so it's a little noisy.   Service depends on who is there. I've gotten some people who are very friendly and nice, and some who just ask you what your order is and hand it out."}
{"text":"I have been to UB off and on for over 5 years. I love the eclectic feel, the homemade pastries, and the sense of comfort. As a consultant without an office, I love when I can find a place with free WiFi where I work for several hours. Although my experience is that the baristas/servers change often, they are most often kind and helpful. My greatest complaint is that in all the years I've been to UB their restrooms are DIRTY. Bathrooms are unisex...which is fine. But when I walk in with the toilet seat up and it's covered in urine drops...it's gross. I've literally walked in to one of the restrooms and there was who knows what all over the seat. I walked out. This bothers me not only when I need to use the restroom but also because Dept of health folks always say that if the bathroom is not well kept,  question the kitchens cleanliness. I looked for their letter rating...maybe I missed it somewhere."}
{"text":"One star is over rating.  It is no longer the coffee shop I once knew and loved. Everything there is now vegan which I noticed deters some of the customers, and the old menu has gone through a few changes none of which were very great.  Food is inconsistent and overpriced."}
{"text":"The women who work the counter are the rudest people I've ever encountered in a small establishment. I guess they have so much business they don't care to lose customers."}
{"text":"Very good food great atmosphere.  If you want a taco but something different.  Try the Peking duck taco."}
{"text":"I ordered Mediterranean salad and it was spicy with organic greens and hint of raspberry. So yummy!  The loose leaf tea was great and comes in a little glass pot, very nice. The price is right, no doubt. Service was quick and efficient, even though the place looked busy. There some comfy chairs around if you stay for a while and Buffalo exchange near by. Overall awesome place and it exceeded my expectations :). Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! I have been coming here for over a year. I have called this my personal office since I was in school! The internet is free, the tea is wonderful, and the food is second to none! The staff always goes the extra mile, and I have never had a bad experience there. A+ in my book!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice.  The food is good, however the poor customer service and general incompetence by the staff does not make-up for it.  I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Great late night place for coffee and relax. Late night spot for students.  Friendly place"}
{"text":"Love the coffee, espresso, and the establishment.  They also have awesome scones.  The owners try to remember all names and faces and are always super friendly.  This place is real close to my office, so I try to stop in at least once a day for a coffee or espresso."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here as I write this.I'm thoroughly unimpressed.   With its bare white walls and sparse attempts at decor, this place is overly and unreasonably obnoxious. Despite not being crowded, and there never being more than one person in front of me each time, I had to wait on line.  With two people working behind the counter there's no reason to forget my order or make me wait 5+ minutes each time I needed something (to get my coffee, to ask for the Internet password, and then to remind them that I ordered coffee). Unfortunately the coffee supplied was  mediocre as best. Disruptive music selection that was too damn loud. Annoying..thank God for pandora.com, a good set of ear-bud, and reasonable wi-fi or I never would have gotten any work done.  The only reason I'd come back here is if my son had another concert to attend nearby. Needless to say, I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop/wine bar in Central Phoenix!  Friendly staff and tasty treats.  I enjoyed my raspberry Italian soda yesterday...perfectly mixed with just the right amount of syrup, soda and cream."}
{"text":"I am surprised how good their vegan pastries are! They are available in many different flavors and varieties. I ordered a plum scone and a gingerbread latte. Both are beyond excellent! The contemporary hip atmosphere is perfect for meetups, or to spend a couple hours chilling with your laptop. I went there at dinner time and they are full. Glad there is a full vegan diner that opens 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Urban Beans is a cool spot ya'll.  The interior is simple and pleasant.  The windows allow a lot of light to come in to make a nice bright atmosphere.  The walls have cool art and chalk drawings.   The drinks are good and reasonably priced.  Try the scones and biscotti.  They are excellent.  Urban Beans has WiFi and an outside patio area.  The baristas are friendly and hip.  I have been there on an open musician night and it was a nice surprise.  Urban Beans seems to be doing everything right.  What a great addition to Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in for coffee.  Been driving past it for ages. Atmosphere is not fancy but clean bought a regular cup of coffee. Best way to test a brand is regular coffee nothing exotic. Coffee was great. I like coffee strong but not so strong it is bitter. Coffee was strong but not so strong it drove itself home. A hidden gem. Worth the trip into town."}
{"text":"Good coffee, nice patio and friendly service. What more can you ask for. Nice to find local flavor. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"Sadly this place is not good. It used to be. It was my go to coffee shop in Phoenix. But the coffee was bitter and bad. My fault that I did not know the menu changed to all vegan but the once delicious scones changed. The one I had was inedible and 1 bite was more than enough. So I paid $7 for wifi, which was good and fast. So that's the one star. Too bad as I always recommended this place to everyone."}
{"text":"What a find! Good coffee and wine selection. Decent desserts, nice ambience and great outdoor patio...AND open 24 hours! Finally, Phoenix needed one of these!"}
{"text":"Great little place!  Took my daughter their after an appointment and used a coupon.  They took they coupon right away.  They food was great loved the little salad that came with our Veggie sandwich.  Really like that they have a dog friendly patio.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to get a vegan meal for my girlfriend drove 20 min out, called in ordered, when I got their they did not have issues with the system. Sat at the store for another 35 min to get my food to go. Understaffed and don't seem to know what they are doing. Sad since we are new to Phx area, also once I got the food to go it was not all that and I paid almost 30 dollars for 2 meals. Sad since we need some good vegan places in AZ! But 1 hour to prepare the food then when I also let them know what is going on and that this is taking too long. No sorry, or say something to make the situation better just it's gonna be ready soon lol! Can't believe this place has 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years, and it is my go to cafe. I love the decor, the art, and the ambiance of the place. The staff is always super friendly, place is very clean, and it's a cafe that's different. they have super comfortable chairs and a full bar andddd.... I probably should have kept this place a secret. Def one of my hideouts/ places I go to get stuff done. Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"The best coffee I have ever had. I ordered a latte with almond milk. i think much better than Starbucks and the customer service is outstanding."}
{"text":"I hope this was an off day but I would be super embarrassed as the owner of this place. The customer service was atrocious. They all seemed out of it. Super slow. Coffee took 30 minutes because he didn't see the cups sitting right next to him. He continued to help others coming in, although it was not busy by any means. The drinks were not good. We left them after we got our 45 minute burritos. Communication is all it takes. Train your employees.   Also, menu online does not match what they're selling. Update. Change. Do something. Have some common sense and courtesy."}
{"text":"Even though we live within walking distance of several great coffee houses we have been consistently thrilled with the service and coffee at Urban Bean.  I have been ordering from the menu and the made fresh egg dishes have all come out fluffy and done to perfection. An extensive list of \"add in\" vegetables means never really ordering the same thing twice! They have yet to decline my request for sliced tomatoes instead of the potatoes that  normally come with this selection.  The cold brew, which I always order, is always smooth and clean. Never over boiled or burnt, never bitter.  There are receptacles and power strips available for charging computers etc. A nice atmosphere with different seating options and music that charms without being intrusive.  Service is always solicitous and at the same time friendly, genuine and warm."}
{"text":"My parents and I went to Urban Beans tonight because I had a restaurant.com coupon.  There is plenty of parking, the cafe is large and there was plenty of room to sit.    We did not stay and eat due to a person playing very loudly on his keyboard so we couldn't converse with the person at the counter without shouting.  This is the kind of place for non-amplified music, but luckily the person took a break about two minutes after we had ordered our food to go.    When we arrived home we found that they had forgotten two of our salads, but everything we had ordered had been prepared well.  Not sure if Ill go back, but it was worth the discounted price."}
{"text":"The basic house coffee was warm (not hot) and it wasn't fresh on my first visit there several months ago. But I'll give them another shot at some point. If you can't get your basic coffee right, there's a big problem."}
{"text":"Sunday omelette :)  A \"MUST VISIT\" if you're in Phoenix.  Food here is great and very healthy (then again, I eat a 3.99 bag of chips by myself every other day so my definition of 'healthy' may not be yours).  Portions here are very reasonable and it is enough to get you to that \"good\" feeling of satisfaction.    Atmosphere has a mix of college students and older crowd."}
{"text":"We were heading home after the Mercury's game and I wanted coffee unfortunately you were unable to make a white mocha but you had a wonderful lemon cupcake available for me and a vegan chocolate cupcake for my sister so it was worth the trip."}
{"text":"I can say this is one of the best vegetarian/vegan places I have been. Great flavor. Great environment. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"I usually like to support independent coffee stands, but this place needs to step up its game.  Friday I ordered my usual nonfat latte. The barista told me they didn't have nonfat milk, but had rice milk, soy milk, and almond milk. Thinking I misunderstood her, I asked \"You don't have any milk?\" to which she said they had whole milk. How does a coffee house not have a few types of cow's milk? Do that many patrons get rice milk in their coffee drinks? Ick. I guess I'm just not hip enough. Urban Beans usually makes a pretty good coffee and their bakery items are good. But it is starting to look a little dingy and dirty and seriously, a coffee house shouldn't run out of milk.  Update:  I visited again in March of 2018 to give Urban Beans another try.  This visit the barista informed me they were \"plant based\" and do not serve cow's milk.  (They didn't used to be.)  So, unless you are vegan, lactose intolerant or for some other reason don't drink cow's milk, you might want to visit Starbucks across the street."}
{"text":"We spent the day here doing work on our laptops, eating some food and drinking various offerings of the cafe. They graciously allowed us to keep our dog inside despite the open patio, and let us camp out at the bar for ~5 hours.   The chai latte is probably the best I have had anywhere, but their smashes are lacking in flavor, though the combinations are imaginitive. I was happy to discover their gluten free scone, but found it somewhat bland as well, though the fruit baked in was very good. The java chip scone was pretty good, as well, and neither were dry like scones usually are. We also got the kale beet salad, which bordered on scrumptious: the beets were cooked perfectly, and the rest mixed well. I think it was worth the twn dollars. No doubt, this place is quite expensive. The regular brew was ok - tasted a little burned, but tolerable.   The music selection was great (wish I had asked what pandora station it was...), and wasn't too loud. It's a comfortable little place and the service is very good. We enjoyed our afternoon here!"}
{"text":"Love the New Yorker bfast sandwich !  Amazing! Open 24/7.. thirst quencher ? Green mint iced tea! I survived off this iced tea"}
{"text":"I love this place! What a great experience! My boyfriend and I stopped in for the first time randomly and was met with cordial baristas, a pleasant atmosphere and a wonderful menu. Nice beer and wine selections- I had the Pinot Noir and he had the Camelback IPA. We were starving and even though we barely missed the cut off for food they still made us a delectable caprese sandwich! Best yet, they have a chess board and we were elated to see they host tournaments! We will definitely be back- be sure to tip well because these guys deserve it ;)"}
{"text":"This has become my go-to place to meet people for coffee meetings. I also had a pretty regular Sunday date with my pal to get work done for the last few months. The staff is friendly, and there is solid food available.   It is clear that the people who work here are invested in its success, which is a nice thing to feel when you're spending a few hours in a place. They have mac and cheese and other real delicious bites so I don't have to eat a scone (my issue with most coffee shops)."}
{"text":"Strong cold brew and really good vegan scones!! I go here all the time! The internet is kind of slow so maybe not the best for work though."}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long to review this place! Best coffee and vegetarian sandwiches! So tasty!  I play chess there all the time! My go to coffee shop for chill vibes"}
{"text":"They just rolled out a new menu that I am not a big fan of. All breakfast sandwiches, burritos, and wraps were removed from the menu. With the exception of the pastries, everything is now build-your-own.  In addition to a complete overhaul of their menu, they were completely out of a handful of ingredients they had listed on their new menu. I was so overwhelmed with their extensive list of ingredients and options, I ended up just getting coffee (which is always a winning decision here).  I most likely won't be eating here again. If I wanted to build my own breakfast, I would have just stayed at home. Restaurants and cafes are supposed to share and suggest what THEY'RE good at making, not what ingredients they have for me to choose from.  Sorry Urban Beans, as a coffee shop, you get 5/5, but as a cafe, I'm now giving you 1/5."}
{"text":"Cute place, interesting and fairly priced menu. Unique clientele (e.g. Tattooed Lady, Old Muscle Guy). Coffee, purportedly medium roast, was way too weak to enjoy, as I am a \"stron coffee aficionado.\"  Blueberry Bran muffin was to die for.   Lady on counter was lost at using the available technology, must have been new. Not necessarily a \"do over\" because of the not very good coffee and proximity to Starbucks and Lux.  Two Stars because of the VERY GOOD Muffin!"}
{"text":"Three stars only because it's a 24 hour shop in a great neighboorhood .... however this new menu sucks with a capital S ! I usually sit on the patio and it would super super super nice if there was some music playing outside to distract from the street noise that would be perfect  .... it's super awkward in there and outside sometimes so I would hope they would add some music to add to the ambiance of this place . Also the food takes forever ! It's great but if I'm paying 15 dollars for a two small sandwiches give me a break and get it to me in less then half an hour ... I mean come on ."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious iced mochas & incredibly friendly staff. Check this spot out if you're in the mood for an iced mocha, and soon enough we all will be ready for sinfully delicious iced coffee drinks once things heat up.  They're baked good and bagels are supplied through Simply Bread, so they're solidly yummy as well.   I feel like they could improve the place with respect to making it cozier, it has sort of an awkwardness to the space planning (some Persian rugs maybe?), but it's still a sweet little biz that we all should try and support.  Wi-Fi, sunshine, and quietness also make it a great spot to work or meet a client for a casual meeting."}
{"text":"I love this spot. Great coffee, decent selection of tea as well. And their food, wow. The #3 burrito is excellent, but you really can't go wrong with any of their options. Nice chessboard. Free wifi.  And to top it all off, they have a 24 hour bar! My only critique is the seating can be kind of tight when they are busy, but I don't feel like it's worth docking them a star. I'm an Urban Bean boy, through and through. You should be too. Or a girl, they are also cool. Am I rhyming, wow I sound like a fool."}
{"text":"The location and atmosphere are fun. However, the product left a lot to be desired.  We ordered two iced drinks. The employee was shaky -- at best -- as to how to make an iced Americano. Ultimately, the drinks were watered down and barely drinkable.  Some training could easily correct this and then we'd return."}
{"text":"Updating my review and lowering the stars. If you go here get the lasagna and the lasagna ONLY. The drinks and deserts are usually pretty terrible. As a vegan I want to love this place but it's been consistently bad. Urban Beans, PLEASE reach out to Green and The Coronado for some advice. I want your place to be just as good."}
{"text":"So I heard about this place thru an acquaintance. She said she knew the owner, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. I just switched jobs, so it conveniently put me across the street from this place on 7th St just north of Osborn. At first I wasn't sure where it was, but the sign that you'll probably see best,  is their Urban Beans sidewalk sign and the other one is hidden behind trees for the most part (its actually their quaint patio with trees in the front that blocks the building. Anyway, I was eager to enter, so off I went. I found parking in the medium-sized parking lot, walked up to find the patio (as mentioned above) and entered the coffee house. It had the same feel as those you might find on Roosevelt. Really artsy and laid back. It has artwork that changes out once a month I believe and...FREE WIFI... yay! And please note, this place offers gluten-free products. I know that is important to a lot of people. So that's a bonus! Also the staff is very friendly and warm. Its so rare to get good customer service nowadays so I really boast about it when cust. service is good. They were eager to help me figure out what I'd like to drink and eat. The guy behind the counter went over the specials and everything. I ordered the turkey with brie. DELISH!  The turkey and brie (good sized portion by the way) had a very nice soft bread and cranberry aioli, brie cheese, with arugula. It also came with a side arugula salad. Very yummy. And I'm pretty sure those were homemade croutons in there too, but not sure though. Now about the coffee. I got one of the many monthly specials decaf / non-fat 'Gingerbread latte'.  Even though I love coffee, I rarely drink it b/c I don't drink caffeinated beverages any longer, but a decaf cup carries little caffeine so I indulge a few times a year. So this drink is way better than the gingerbread latte at Starbucks. (Dare I utter the words Starbucks in this place, they would prob. kick me out..lol) It was bold, creamy and very flavorful. I really enjoyed it. In fact, a few days later, I got another one!!   Go ahead and try this place, I have already recommended it to a fellow co-worker, and he too, loved this place and is going to go back again."}
{"text":"great place that is locally owned. food and drinks and prices are all good!"}
{"text":"Ok first time here. Girl with a smile behind counter so starting out well. Hands me the plastic menu. Dirty!  Very Dirty. Ordering went well and she got all that right. You order at counter and get your own water. Do you still tip 20%? Not sure but computer came up automatically 18 or 20 or other on screen. That was dirty also.   Went to bathroom to wash hands. The door has dirty blue tape on it but overall bathroom good. No print out of receipt. Waiting on food now.... Tofu scramble and jackfruit to come...  Ok scramble here and jackfruit came 4 min after. Not that big of a deal as this is not a 100% full service restaurant. Potatoes seem to be frozen ones - however, not bad as the price is right. Not for sure if they are frozen or not. The gal made adjustments with a smile and the cook got all correct. The scramble was a little salty. Overall good. Now the jackfruit tacos - I adjusted to corn tortilla instead of a torta. WOW. Outstanding!  Maybe best I've had. Let me say it again - Outstanding!  A little cleaning and lighten up on salt and this place is a 5 star. I will return. Wait....  I went to get the scone. The gal was very helpful on what was vegan even came around the bakers case. Scone was perfect."}
{"text":"Urban Beans does a nice job at lunch.  We enjoyed a bowl of lentil soup with some great toasted ciabatta bread and a salad.  They let the beans shine through with just a hint of onions, potatoes and carrots.  Very tasty and healthy."}
{"text":"24 hour coffee shop with free wifi and good coffee? YES. Perfect for getting out of the house for that all nighter essay or cramming session."}
{"text":"I visited friends for a weekend and before setting off to explore Phoenix, coffee was the first thing we wanted. My friends spoke highly of this place and I didn't see any reason why I should give it a whirl.   I ordered their Iced Horchata with two shots of espresso. Now, growing up I wasn't a fan of horchata, prior to my visit here, I wasn't sure where I stood with it still. I am here to declare that I've developed a liking.   The horchata is made in house, how would I know? I tasted the rice that had gathered at the bottom of my cup. It was delicious and it gave great texture to my drink. The cinnamon and seasoning were just right and not overwhelming. As an added bonus, frozen mango cubes were sprinkled on top! On a very hot Arizona day, chewing on a frozen fruit helps!   They displace their pastries and food in a well kept case. And their condiment bar is very organized. The decor is eclectic. It has an organized, home feel to it. The tables and chairs are miss-match but it works. There is a table with a chess set which I always find awesome! They have a restroom that is co-ed. Their patio area is cute and has plenty of shade! The entire place looks neat and clean!  Parking wasn't an issue and there seemed to be plenty!   The staff is very helpful and friendly. They answered all the questions that were asked and they even helped my friend decide on a drink.   I am definitely visiting again!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while since I used to work down the street from Urban Beans. I fell in love with their iced chai tea latte. It's not watered down or flavorless like some of the other coffee shops. It's flavorful and yummy in my tummy with just the right amount of spices and herbs, the way chai tea is supposed to taste like. They also have a great patio to just sit back, relax, and read a book."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the Coronado neighborhood and was hoping to find a good alternative to my favorite Melrose coffee shop.  a friend told me about Urban Beans and how great it was.  I didn't make it in during the holidays, but I finally did yesterday.  The place is really spacious, bright, and inviting.  There are plenty of tables and chairs and it looks like a great place to study, read, or  hang out with a friend or two.  I ordered a cafe au lait to go.  The nice guy at the counter asked me what ratio of coffee-to-milk I wanted and what kind of milk I wanted.  While the traditional cafe au lait is equal parts coffee and steamed whole milk, I don't always want lots of coffee flavor, so I found it thoughtful that he asked.  The display case had lots of different goodies, and had I not just purchased some delectable creme brulee from Torched Goodness, I would have chosen a treat.  I have been told they also serve sandwiches and have some of the best hummus/veggie plates.  I'm really looking forward to trying that!  My heart still belongs to my old coffee shop, but I think I'm going to really enjoy stopping in at Urban Beans.  Hooray!"}
{"text":"I feel like the decor and chairs need an upgrade but the food is great. They have pulled jackfruit sandwiches that are awesome along with a lot of other good sandwiches and salads. Their bread is really really delicious. I will say that the fruit smoothies were not good. They really did had no taste to them but the food makes up for that."}
{"text":"For a 24 hr place it was a very pleasant experience. The person at the front didn't notice me for a very, very, very long time... Ok, so it's not Starbucks. Then, I asked her about the pastries, and she's basically like \"Well, is that what the tag says? I can't see it?\" Ok the tag said just \"dairy\" and I found out those were their non-vegan selections... She turned it around and was lovely. The lack of a star is because I was expecting more food choices. The outside seating was nice and clean. I wasn't able to sleep and that place was somewhere to go and just write and think. If I was vegan, I would have probably stayed longer and had plenty of food choices. I have vegan friends who struggle so I see what it feels like."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich was terrific with a mimosa which I believe had muddled raspberry? Capuccino has cinnamon sprinkled on top which I don't really care for but otherwise it was good. I love supporting local businesses and this is worthy of support."}
{"text":"I've only had a chance to try their drink menu but that was all it took for me to fall in love! Everyone should try their mocha and next time I'm definitely grabbing a piece of quiche."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food has been ok, but nothing to write home about.  The breakfast burrito + chorizo is always a good choice. Be aware it is vegetarian and not real chorizo.  Smoothies were OK and the iced coffee certainly gets the job. The big appeal to me is the fact that it's open 24 hrs."}
{"text":"Second time out of three that I ordered a breakfast burrito and it never got made. When I asked what was the problem, the cook said they never got my order. This happened TWICE out of 3 visits. I will never, ever, ever go there again. I would caution anyone else also, unless you have the patience of Gandhi.  That and the first time this happened, they said I never even ordered the food. Funny I got charged for it. I left passed off and said I would not go back. Shame on me. Had to go to Starbucks next door, not that good but at least they get the order."}
{"text":"This place is literally the worst. I live down the street and have been here twice and the staff never knows what they're doing. They told me they didn't have bloody mary's when I could actually see a bottle of bloody mary mix sitting on the bar. Then I had to tell the girl making me drink that bloody mary's are made with vodka. Another girl tried to give my boyfriend a beer that was literally have foam and ask if it was ok. The staff is so incompetent, I really don't think it's they're fault, but they obviously have received no training. I wish I hadn't given this place a second chance, I'm still waiting for my bloody mary and just want to leave. I never give 1 star reviews but this place really deserves it."}
{"text":"The caprese sandwich is fantastic. Highly recommend it. Also the side salad that came with was even great. Great atmosphere and staff polite. Cook made the sandwich right in front of you so you know what's in it. I am definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Fun, relaxing place to catch up with friends, study, or just grab a sangria just  because. I love that they're open 24/7, especially being a student looking for quiet corners to study."}
{"text":"We were traveling through town and needed a place to eat that had healthy food. We asked www.healthycow.com and found the Urban Bean Cafe and Bar. It was homey while still being chic.. and the food was amazing. I loved the paintings and I found that there was people who were really involved with loving the food they served you. The Hazelnut Chocolate Chip Cookie was amazing... and I am sure there were more things to try in the case that were just as good. Love it and it comes highly recommended. peace"}
{"text":"We have been here 4 times before and USED to find it a very comfortable place to hang out and eat.  Tonight we went and found the menu had changed...there were just a list of ingredients and a couple of coffee choices with a list of flavors syrups. It was painful to look at and we decided to just get the frozen vanilla coffee drink we have gotten before. After asking us if it was like a frappacino, the person behind the counter said she could try to make how to make it. We asked where the chessboard was ( we have played chess for hours there before), she told us it was outside. We found it in a heap thrown in a table, it was so dirty that it looked as if it had been sitting in a dump for months...and on of the pieces was missing. They were also playing rap music, dropping the n-bomb every other sentence...not a fit for anyone there. She came out with two drinks instead of one and told us she accidentally made more. They were downright awful, like black coffee ground with ice. We brought the drinks up and I told her that they were really poor, not sweet at all like before. She then exclaimed that she used too much ice, and she would make them over using more vanilla \"pops\". She had us taste them again and they were frothy and now tasted like nothing. We asked her when they changed the menu, she told us three days ago?!? She then proclaimed that we probably wanted a \"vanilla smash, she also informed us that it used powder the make  it  sweeter... We left after we paid for the drink.... Doubtful on a return"}
{"text":"My only complaint about this place is that the tables are wobbly. Should be easy to fix. Staff is generally friendly, albeit some are certainly more anxious to please than others. Variety of food and drinks is excellent, despite the fact that they are vegan. Haven't tried the wine bar.  Open 24 hours, and usually parking is readily available (which is not the case with the mini-center just across the street)."}
{"text":"Decent espresso, good selection of drinks & food, friendly staff, priced a tad higher than other places. Great place to get some work done."}
{"text":"Ok, this was my first time here. The Joe is good and they are open 24-7. This is Vegan heaven. All of the menu is in that fashion. No meat here.   I can't  right a full review because I'm carnivorous and need my meat. This place is located in the middle of the Central Corridor and is a very welcoming establishment. It has a very granola feel to it. I might bike here again for coffee at some point. Put meat on the menu and I'll be back often. Cool art on the walls! Be cool hipsters!  #vino2 #vino2ultimate #vinosquared"}
{"text":"Urban Beans is definitely a great find in Urban Phoenix. While this coffee shop makes its home on busy 7th street, the second I stepped foot inside, I forgot what was going on outside. Urban Beans has the perfect environment of independent coffee shop meets a clean and modern space with an eclectic touch. There's plenty of seating inside and out and they even have comfy chairs at the tables. Free Wii Fi and electrical outlets make this the perfect work space and the food and drink options make it the ideal one.   The iced coffee here is delicious and I was happy to learn that they have sugar free chocolate syrup which is far and few between! It is pricey though and was $5.04 for a large iced coffee. I would definitely be in trouble if I worked here too long and too much! But the coffee is good and the environment is even better so I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was trying to decide what to do to kill an hour before the gym and yelped tea so that I could read my boom when this place popped up! I got the peach green tea ( has a creative name but I forgot already) and a yummy cinnamon scone. Will be back to try things out on the menu when I have time!"}
{"text":"I Googled \"24 hour coffee places\" and this was one of 3 that came up for the entire valley. It was basically on my commute in so it worked for me. I pulled up to the place and it was well lit and inviting. I walk in and there are 2 employees inside who greeted me. I went to the counter to order my coffee and the lady was very nice. She asked what my name was and I gave it to her. She introduced herself as Amanda and asked if I had ever been there. I said it was my first time and they both thanked me for coming to check them out. I let them know that I probably would only be in about once a month because thats how often my job requires me to work in the middle of the night.   They said they had only been open 24 hours for about a week. I guess its lucky since I was desperate for my fix. My coffee was ready and they hooked me up with a cookie for ciming in to check them out so I thought that was pretty cool. The coffee was pretty good and Im wide awake now as I write this review! All in all it was great personable service (which unfortunately is somewhat rare these days) so I would recommend this place for all your caffeine and baked treat needs!   Oh also they didnt have stir sticks. They had regular tea spoons to stir my coffee as they were trying to be as green as they could so I respected that.   Give UB a chance!"}
{"text":"Although the service was very good, the coconut milk cappuccino was the worst I have ever had in my entire life. The pizza pocket I had was mostly bread and although they claimed it came with marinara ( well seasoned!! ) it was not properly reduced to be that. The bread itself was under-baked and had a soggy bottom. You can use a rolling pin or even wine bottle with rubber bands to create an even level for the dough to create a consistent bake and avoiding the insanely thick bottom. Pizza should be GB&D always, even if you are going to reheat it, usually a good even brown will be fine, take it to European brown for reheat. I would reduce down that really tasty marinara a bit more, blend it with an immersion blender would be perfect.  As for the coffee, all about temperature control and time management. Such a fricken nice espresso machine. I have faith in y'all, make people understand how awesome you are. Just refine it a bit"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what a local coffee shop in Phoenix should be.  Lots of sunlight, good iced coffee.  (Also, apparently, they serve wine!)"}
{"text":"My two co-workers and I went to UB for lunch today after another local restaurant was completely busy. I used to go to UB a lot before my job relocated so I recommended we went there based on my previous experiences a couple of years ago.  We got there at noon and I ordered an omelet which included oven roasted potatoes and 3 basic ingredients. In addition I added a \"premium\" ingredient; cheese and ordered a small white chocolate mocha. My bill came out to around $16.00 which I thought was a little pricey. One of my co-workers order an English muffin and the other ordered an omelet as well.   At around 12:30 they both went to check on the order and were told they needed 10 more minutes to finish making our food. At 12:38, I went back to ask about our food which one of the guys was already placing it in his hands to take our orders to us. I asked him what took so long and he apologized and told me he was new and so was the cook. He then told me they were both left alone which delayed things. I was annoyed that it took so long because we had to be back at work at 1:00 but I didn't say anything more and sat down.  As I went to quickly eat my food I realized two things: Our oven roasted potatoes were missing and we had cold and wet scrambled eggs on our plate, not an omelet.  I went back inside and told the same guy that our potatoes were missing and he said: \"I'm sorry, do you need them.\" to which I responded that I did not need them but I paid for them. He offered to have the potatoes made for us, however at this point we were already so late that I was concerned about the length of time it would take to have those out. He also offered me a refund which I explained to him that I appreciated the offer but I was not looking for free food and did not want to take money away from a small local business. I added that I was just frustrated with the situation and agreed to have the potatoes made to go while I ran back out to inhale my food. The cook came out about 5 minutes later and gave us the to- go boxes and apologized as well, stating they were both left alone and were new to the job.  I felt so bad for them because although I was not mean, they could definitely see I was very irritated. It was not their fault they were left there alone yet they were the ones that had to listen to me vent. I hope that whoever manages these two employees takes the time to properly train them before leaving them alone. The place was not busy at all which makes me wonder what they would've done under even more pressure of having more people to serve. Needless to say, I was late, the food had no taste and it was pricey. I left very disappointed from this place."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time this morning and was amazed! The dirty chai was really good! Ill def be back here next week."}
{"text":"Coffee is great and pastries are delicious. I will stop by for some lavender cake to get my sweet fix. I probably would not go out of my way to go here if I didn't live close by. Its within walking/biking distance for me so its the best option. The staff is a bit sleepy and sometimes forgets my order but they are always really nice about it when I remind them.  Im not to hot about their bar since the first time I went and was served corked wine, and then continually served corked wine till we both got frustrated and I just ordered a beer. To be fair, the wine had been sitting out on the counter in a Phoenix summer. It is a nice place to work and get good coffee and pastries. I have not ordered any mixed drinks at the bar or tried their happy hour."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed. Hot latte and espresso brownie. Both were sub-par. No foam whatsoever on latte. Barely lukewarm too. Brownie had no espresso taste - or even chocolate for that matter. Place is messy and unappealing. Staff is busy talking to each other instead of customers. Sorry but if you want to play with the other true coffee houses in town ie. Press, Cartel or Echo you'll have to up your game UB."}
{"text":"cupcakes!...this place is adorable and cozy with a roomy patio with quite a few tables and they serve hefenveisen....their staff is friendly and helpful...which we all commented \"goes a long way in phoenix\"...and if that wasnt fabulous enough...you can even bring your dog to the patio. they play movies projected onto the outdoor patio wall and short leash dogs was there that nite...they closed at 8 so i didnt get to try any dogs but my dog had a fabulous time! woohoo- as good as it gets...they even have a lot of parking along both sides of the building...all n all...a win win of a spot!"}
{"text":"Had to wait over 1/2 hour to get food.  Food was good but small portions and not what I expected to get. Coffee ran out, so I was shorted coffee. Staff was inattentive.   Very cool atmosphere except for staff."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance it comes with, you can either sit out side or stay inside and just relax. the coffee is great! great alternative to Starbucks!"}
{"text":"The coffee is great but the real winner are the scones at Urban Beans. Most scones I have tasted from coffee shops are dry and a bit chalky but Urban Beans has perfected the art of the \"scone\". They are moist and savory yet sweet. My favorite is the pear, brie(?) or gorgonzola (?) I highly recommend it for a quick on the go treat."}
{"text":"You know, Ive come to Urban Beans many times in the past and it was great. Send my hubby to grab food today and wow! What a disappointment. I had an egg sandwich which the egg was overly peppered and grey. Gross, which is too bad because the english muffin was really good. The fruit salad was also gross, the strawberries were brownish and transparent and the cantaloupe was mushy and mealy too. Also had a yogurt parfait with granola and there was 2 tablespoons max of yogurt and the rest of the cup was granola! Its supposed to be the other way around. Disappointing because I wanted to support a local business, but I cant wait for the Starbucks to open now!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. First off, I waited exactly 3 minutes  and 23 seconds before I was acknowledged (and  yes, I timed it) For a place that seems pretty prideful in food options online, the 'cook' didn't seem terribly concerned or knowledgable in what was in the featured item of the day. (Jack fruit tacos) I asked what all went in it before I ordered she literally shrugged at me and looked up at the menu for clues. The girl who rang me up mentioned to her 'we you should know since you're gonna be making it if she orders it.'  Another disappointment, I wanted to order a raw juice, I asked if it was possible to get just carrot and ginger, she said 'they're premade cause if you've owned a juicer, you'd know they're a bitch to clean.' ...I'm okay, so you're not willing to make something I can have just because the equipment is a hassle for you to clean?  Moving on, since I couldn't have anything else, I opted for lemonade...tastes like watered down minute maid...the jackfruit tacos we're okay,...but left me hungry again an hour later...for $11.95...I'd hoped to be full a little longer..  Overall, for being 'vegan friendly' ...allergens don't seem to be a priority here...gluten free options seemed to be next to nothing which was a bit of a let down. Perhaps I had higher expectations from seeing such high reviews on this place, but I don't think I'll be returning to a place where the workers make you feel like you're an inconvenience to serve."}
{"text":"Big piece of plastic bag in the food? What is wrong with vegetarian/vegan places in Phoenix? I really start to think anything marked vegan here will get high ratings just because they look trendy/fancy. This place has super slow service. Waited 10 minutes for the two staff try to open a wine for a customer, just so to make an order. Jackfruit was obvious leftovers. The staff tried to reheat from whatever left and sitting in a pan for who knows how long, and they were still cold when I got them. Dried bread and tiny little fillings. And I found a big piece of plastic bag in the sandwich!!!! See the pictures. And it's $10!!! Disgusting place! Only second time here and I swear I will never ever return to this place again. I really lose my trust in vegetarian/vegan place in Phoenix. Like this place, so overrated and they are just not even decent. Please be warned."}
{"text":"Sorry, did not like the food.  Besides the fact that it's waaay to expensive it's just not that great.  Coffee got me sick to my stomach from all the flavoring they put in it.  Not for me."}
{"text":"Cue the circus music.   Here's the deal; the staff are epic. Talented, communicative, fun, friendly, inviting, worthy of mass praise across the board. There are few coffee shops in phoenix that offer a non-pretentious experience, that also happen to employ logic based staff who operate with an above average level of competency. It's impressive to find this in PHX, let alone at a 24 hour spot. The staff get 5 HUGE Stars, no doubt.  ...and they make the best MF'ing Jackfruit Breakfast Burrito this mouth has ever masticated, courtesy of Chef-God Ivan the Great. If you don't know what Jackfruit is, get your ass in here and nom your way to a quivering mouth-gasm.  Latte's are on FLEEK by the always impressive Super-Brenda, and so is the wi-fi speed - which is never slow, even when the place is stacked with the always entertaining, caffein saturated college crowd. I really can't say enough about the return on investment from an employee & food/drink standpoint. You won't find better in PHX - especially at 2am.   So why 1 Star? Because despite how exceptional many of the staff are, the owners clearly have no concept of what effective business leadership requires. Their staff operate from a dwarfed position of generalized disenfranchisement. Spend 10 minutes with any of them and you can see how unappreciated, neglected, and overall, undervalued they are. We see this in the way they are treated, the lack of resources that they are provided with to make the UB experience what it really COULD be, lack of time-off, open all holidays (which is BS), etc.   This is not information that the employees disseminate, but after talking with most of them at length, and witnessing the truth of it from the \"customer\" perspective - over the course of weeks of 1st person exposure, the truth becomes evident - pissing off us loyal customers.  As a multi-business owner, I understand that there is nothing more critical for business success than employee satisfaction. When your employees feel valued, and appreciated, they become the most influential mouthpiece a company can ever hope to have - worth their weight in gold.   The fact that Urban Beans' owners do not recognize this - illustrated by the sheer number of AWESOME, yet broken-down employees Urban Beans employs - is infuriating for those of us who respect the work these hustlin' folks produce - in the trenches, building the Urban Beans brand with every new customer who walks through the door.   Having been to Urban Beans dozens of times over the past several months, my wife and I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to get to know many of the great staff here. As much as I don't want to support UB ownership, I cannot imagine NOT supporting their employees, who make the brand what it is. They are the lifeblood, the heartbeat of the UB experience. Without them, UB is nothing more than another failed, vacant commercial property, skid marking the Phoenix landscape.   So, to re-cap:   *Crappy ownership *Failed management *Talented (yet undervalued) chefs & baristas  *MF'ing EPIC Jackfruit Burritos *Dope ass latte's *Favorable wifi *Casual, friendly, non-pretentious environment *Open 24 hours  ...and can I just say, WTF is with all the damn FISH art all around the place? As a visual artist, I appreciate all expressions of creativity, but enough is enough.   Well done UB employees, for rising to the occasion, despite all the obstacles that are constantly being placed in your way. Mad respect. ((Hat Tip))  UB owners/managers - get a fu#!ing clue. Business management 101, take care of your staff."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place two stars for the fact that they are open 24 hours. It is so hard to find a place to hang out late at night with friends. My sister and I decided to give Urban Bean a try. We drove 25 mins to reach our destination and the minute we got there we were having doubts. The place was small and could use some updating with their decoration. They had a nice patio area to sit and hang out which I loved, but the seats were kindda dirty so we weren't comfortable sitting on it. The staff were nice and friendly, so I will give them credit for that. We must of caught them on a bad night because their oven was down and most items were out, so we couldn't order any food. The only thing that we could order was the hummas dish which we regret. It was $8 but was cold and dry, not very appealing at all. The drinks however was not so bad. We left this place feeling very disappointed and a waste of gas driving there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get coffee in the Valley. The flavor is bold and every single food item I've tried is delicious. The location is central so it is convenient to meet up with friends that live all over Phoenix. I highly recommend Urban Beans!"}
{"text":"Once again, my quest to steer clear from corporate or chain coffee has led me to a pleasant surprise!  This place isn't nearly as hipster as I expected. In fact, it was calm, mostly quiet, relaxing, friendly, and most of all inviting, which is kind of the exact opposite of a hipster coffee shop (I still love you Lux don't worry). It was a bright and airy late morning, with a jubilant gentleman playing acoustic guitar.   I ordered a cold brew, which was delicious. Their pastries are good, too. The vegan brownie was light and tasty, and my friend totally loved her scone. We'll be back to try some more of the fuller breakfasts.   Apparently, they've got some craft draughts in the afternoon, so I can see this as a place to have a quick pint on a warm afternoon. It's a bit small, but with great atmosphere, kind staff, and good products, so I'll certainly return!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch and a cup of expresso jo. Omg not so good. Weak jo and the food took exactly 38 minutes to show. I was so ready to go by then. The bathroom door opens to the small little seating area -- which was dirty by the way -- and the rest of the place looked shabby too. I checked in my food to see when it'd arrive, and I wasn't treated to well. (I wish I cud have taken back my tip!) When my California wrap came out, it was in a white tortilla when I was told it was corn. What they did was take it back, dump oit half the filling and give me two cold tortillas with cold filling. So unappealing. Needless to say, I'm not impressed and I don't think I'll be back. Sad meal and a waste of my time and dollars."}
{"text":"Great coffee, friendly service, and good food."}
{"text":"I've been on a coffee quest lately and popped in here for an Americano and a brownie the other day. They had a line going so it was a wait: A. to put in my order; and B. to get my order. Fortunately I was not pressed for time so this wasn't a deal breaker for me on this particular day.  Strange that as soon as my order arrived, the number of staff went from two to four-things went much more smoothly after this. Maybe it was dead and two people went on break and five minutes later a crowd came in. Who knows and like I said, not a deal breaker. I enjoyed my Americano and the man who waited on me heated my brownie, which was a nice touch. The place reminds me of a cafe I used to hit when I was in Buenos Aires so it made me feel nostalgic. Just a touch of European flavor mixed in with great local products. Truth be told, I probably I like the atmosphere here more than what I consumed. I have to say that  the Espresso at Lux is THE BEST in The Valley and nothing, including Urban Beans, has come close. But as I've seen myself saying a lot lately, this is no reason not to check these guys out. In addition to coffee, they have pastries, smoothies, sandwiches and other cafe fare. I also like the wine bar which I may need to visit in the near future. One of their best features is the patio which will be a great place to enjoy a brew or a glass of vino. So I like the place and I will be back."}
{"text":"I love living in Phoenix and having my rotation of spots to hit each week, UB is one of the coffee shops I hit on my way to work. Not my favorite, but by all means in the top five. It's clean, well stocked, well lit, and certainly gets me fueled for the day. I don't mind that the prices are slightly higher than some of my other coffee stops, esp now that Starf*cks is next door, in fact I have bumped UB up on my rotation as a response to that terrible chain being so close, I want to do my part to help them out. A good, quick cup, and fantastic baked goods are always available. I dig this spot, and wish them the best! One of these evenings I need to stop by for a beer, been meaning to do so..."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this place is EXPENSIVE! It makes Starbucks look cheap compared to their prices. I got a SMALL iced coffee for almost $5. Even Starbucks is cheaper! The coffee was just an average ice coffee flavor like the one you can get at McDonalds for $1.49 (medium size) but they are a rip off! Plus they have horrible customer service. When I was in line there was one person in front of me and it was not busy at all, but they took forever taking his order and there was two people helping him and they weren't even helping him they kept on laughing and talking about random stuff, as if they were friends, which I truly don't care but it was an inconvenience because I had to wait 5-10 minutes for just 1 person in front of me. They didn't even greet me say \"hello, good morning, we will be with you in a minute\" NOTHING! They both saw me and I had my wallet in my hand and staring at both of the workers who were just chatting with the person in front of me who was most likely a friend. (I could tell by there conversation.) to indicate that I am ready to order, but nope I waited 5-10 minutes just for them both to acknowledge me and say \"what can I get for you?\" Not even a \"sorry for the wait\". Also it was my first time going in so I asked what she recommends and she said \"everything's good\" ok... Um thanks for your recommendation.. NOT. I then asked her what kind of iced coffee they have and she answered with a rude/ angry \"all that you can think of\" Just no help at all. There menu is not even readable and it's just crazy that they even have semi-decent reviews on Yelp because they do NOT deserve it. Plus the tables were dirty and they had no clients! I was NOT impressed at all. Save your money!! & Pass this place it really is nothing special. I will NEVER return and will make sure my friends and family don't ever stop at this place."}
{"text":"Went this morning for coffee and scones with my toddler. The scones were amazing and my vanilla latte was delicious.  I didn't see any highchairs which is always a bummer when I'm out with the little one.  I had a hard time hearing the cashier as it was a little too loud and we were the only ones in there. The customer service was average but again the food and drinks were awesome. I will most likely stop in again."}
{"text":"This review is only for the environment and coffee. Did not try any of the food but the coffee was pretty meh.  There was a lack of flavoring options that I am used to. And they didn't put much ice in my iced coffee so by the time I sat down it was already melted and wasn't cold more like luke warm. The environment was very unique with a cute patio with unique furniture.  Was a nice day out so sat outside. Was very cool and they had potted plants. Probably won't come again but wasn't bad either. Could see it as a cool hang out place with friends."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to give this place a good review, but I just cannot. Once again, this is a charming little spot in my area that ive drove by a thousand times and never stopped in. After waking up at the god awful hour of 6am on a Saturday (garbage I know lol), I decided to drag my half awake self over here for some breakfast. My mom had given me a coupon from her entertainment book for a bogo deal.   First impression from the outside, cute. I like the mismatched furniture outside. And since it was cool enough out this past weekend, we were able to sit out there and not roast. It kind of went downhill from there, sadly. When we walked in, there were more employee's than customers, and we were not greeted with even a hello. That bugged me. Second, the menu was very underwhelming. Since both my son and I are picky, we stuck with simple items. I got the potato cheese and egg burrito, he got the egg and cheese English muffin and a blackberry lime scone. The scone was actually very good, the other items were just okay. I also ordered a hot chai latte and a cold horchata for the little one. Those were good as well.   Overall, I was just very unimpressed with the place. The prices are reasonable, great location, but other than that, there is nothing that makes me want to come back here."}
{"text":"Cold brew was very smooth and of course strong! I think it was better than Starbucks! Great place to chill, relax and work on homework!"}
{"text":"Great products, but they seem to be out of stuff often and or their reward point machine is down.  Frustrating when you pass 50 other places you could have stopped at.  About the third time now fir this situation."}
{"text":"The coffee and food is really good!! I'm excited about their vast options for vegans, and the inside is really pretty. It's also great that they're 24 hours, so if I want to come by late at night to catch up on some homework or something, I can. However, there is this one girl that works there (blonde short hair, piercings) that is incredibly rude. Both times I've been in i've seen her be rude to her coworker(s), be short with other customers, and be rude to my mom and I. It's just kind of a bummer, since it is such a nice place."}
{"text":"I love this little cafe. It's close to home, serves food that is consistently amazing, and makes a fantastic dirty chai.  Nathaniel and Amanda can pretty much anticipate my order now that I've become a regular and always greet me with a smile. They obviously are passionate about what they do and that's refreshing!  Some mornings can be a little crazy: professionals with laptops and cell phones abuzz. If that's not your speed, wait till around 9am or try another day. I often see students studying here as well. :)"}
{"text":"Daisy made an awesome Italian bake! Daisy was also super helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. Thank you for me delicious vegan calzone/bake it was the perfect thing after a long work day! I absolutely loved the patio/outdoor seating space."}
{"text":"Yum!  First visit today and I was deff impressed.  Tried the chai and a potato quiche.  Chai wasn't bad, quiche was delicious.  Prices are right at what you would expect for a cute coffee house.  Vibe was very relaxed.  Can't wait to come again and try some of the other good, and check out the wine!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a coffee date with a girlfriend to catch up on gossip. Neither of us had been here before but UB is located on 7th street/thomas so it was a good location for both of us. She got a nonfat latte, I got a cappuccino. I chose the larger size for something like .50 more. Holy huge mug. I'm not kidding- I could not fit my 2 hands around this mother. It had 4 shots of espresso and was more than impressive. I think it cost me $4.00 total. The coffee was good, but I preferred Lux & Lola back in the day for coffee. Anyway, my friend and I split some sort of chocolate hazelnut torte dessert. It was dry and poor tasting. The fresh raspberry sauce on the top gave it some redemption, but it was not worth the calories or money. Overall, our bill was $13.00 which was a little pricey for the quality & lack of freshness of the torte. The atmosphere was quite nice, however. Coming for the atmosphere alone would be worth it. I suspect the other desserts in the case were  better than the one I got based on other reviewers feedback. They also have a cute, cozy patio right out front with strings of lights, plants and nice seating. In nice weather, it would be a great hangout spot. I'll return and try a different treat next time. I enjoy supporting local business and this place is a cute keeper.   Worthy to note- I also saw the workers there writing some sort of Happy Hour menu up on their big white board- something like 4-7 Monday thru Friday....? I have no idea what was on there but this place would be a great HH place to unwind with a few co-workers if you aren't into the bar scene.   Other thing to note- park in the lot SOUTH of the bldg, it is much larger and easier to get into/out of. The lot north of the bldg is crowded with spaces packed in like sardines. Good place to get your car dented/scratched."}
{"text":"Get Your PHX got me here for my second visit yesterday and I'm glad they did!  Two months ago they built a bar in the place, serving craft beer and select wine.  They'll soon have a full dinner menu as well.  We packed the house for a free wine pairing [I know it's a small business and know how much Virginia Senior, proprietress sacrificed] on their regular 'BU Thursday' wine pairing event - a mere $15 normally.  Virginia, at least for me, your sacrifice will not have been in vain - you've secured 2 new regular customers!  The sommelier's discernment shined brightly and the chef's pairing choices were competent and then some - I rarely get the 'frisson' I experienced in the Queso Manchego paired with the 2008 Edge Cabernet.  You won't regret showing up next Thursday for their weekly wine pairing."}
{"text":"This was a cute place, just down from Starbucks and a nice alternative. I got a cappuccino- the espresso flavor was strong and the foam was perfect. It has a nice seating area outdoors and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"They only reason I didn't give this place 5 star is there portion of food I tried the raco tacos and was so disappointed 10$ and there was barely anything I'm a small girl and I was left wanting to buy somthing else over priced to eat I understand vegan food is difficult to make while still tasting delicious but I just felt ripped off....How ever the coffee I have a dozen times and it is AMAZING! i will have to try something else on the menu and give another chance plus the atmosphere and environment  here is very comfortable and welcoming"}
{"text":"Went here hoping for some pie and they were out. Actually they had very little selection of anything. Still searching for that place where you can go out and get dessert (like pie). This place was not it."}
{"text":"Urban Bean is simply delicious! I can't seem to stop gushing about this place because the food is amazing. Its upscale taste at a reasonable cost.  I must admit that the only disappointment I had about this place was that more people weren't there to discover the tastiness of their food. I had a Pear and Arugula dish and the goat cheese, pesto, and sun dried tomatoes dish. Both made me mouth happy. Overall this place is adorable and the staff including the owner are helpful and friendly. I'd suggest that all of PHX go to this place and enjoy."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop! They have excellent service and they have delicious coffee! They also have a fantastic almond latte! I have tried any of their baked goods but they look delish! This coffee shop is also environmentally friendly! Their coffee lids are made from cornstarch and plastic ware is made from potato starch, they dissolve in compost in so many days...So this coffee shop is a must stop for the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this place and sadly, was disappointed. I had the roasted vegetable sandwich. They forgot the cheese and when I sent it back it returned cold with the cheese not melted. The sandwich was okay. I've had better roasted vegetable sandwiches at many places. And for $10 it was just a sandwich, no sides.  The place itself left a lot to be desired. Crowded, uncomfortable and no ambience.   Not a place I would go back to which is a bummer because I'm always looking for new vegan/vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast spot to come to. It is a vegetarian place but they have some items on the menu that are vegan or can be made vegan. I came and there was a line so I assumed it was going to be pretty good. It was a spacious and clean building, good seating area and they provide wifi.   I ordered to dine in and I got the #1 burrito which had potatoes, pinto beans, and chipotle sauce and I added spinach and mushrooms. Food got to me pretty quickly and it was so good that I make my own version of it at home now! The only downside was that they didn't have that many vegan dessert options, but what more can you really expect if you go to a vegetarian place?   Workers were friendly and helpful since it was my first time going there. Definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a chill place to enjoy breakfast in the downtown Phoenix area."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here because it was late and we were both craving matcha lattes. Happened to pass by and decided to give it a try. The cafe itself is very cute and I like how it is open 24 hours. The drinks were also pretty good (aside from being more room temperature than hot). However, the customer service that was received was not top notch. My friend got her drink right away, mine ended up being forgotten and I waited about 20 minutes for it. When I asked about it they didn't even know my order and told me someone else must have taken it even though nobody else had ordered drinks. I do appreciate them giving me a bigger size for the mistake, but I am not sure I will be returning."}
{"text":"I was pumped to see that there was a 24 hour vegan coffee shop not far from where I live, but this place was disappointing. All the tables in the patio area had food residue or bird poop on them, and there were a bunch of plates that clearly had been sitting there a while and had flies swarming around. It felt gross and dirty. The drink that I ordered was bland and watery and they no longer serve the burritos and tortas that are listed on the menu online - just a random selection of pastries and some jackfruit calzone type thing."}
{"text":"I love Urban Beans! It is probably one of the best coffee houses I have been to. The staff members are great and there is plenty of seating and lots of plugs for computers. The WiFi is very reliable! Can't wait for the weather to get a little warmer so I can have coffee on the patio!"}
{"text":"I'm a gluten-free vegan who usually has to eat vegetarian because of available options. But this place is all vegan, all the time. They usually have something GF in the pastry case as well, which means I'm in cafe heaven. You're not up-charged for non-dairy milk because that's all they carry. It's fantastic to patronize somewhere that has the same values I do.  I've been there many times, as it's a hot spot for the local live theater scene. This last weekend I had a lavender iced latte with soy milk and I was in heaven. I enjoyed it on the spacious patio and chatted with my sister. It was quiet perfection in the heart of sprawling Phx. N. Burns, the owner, is friendly and kind and a great supporter of the arts and his community. You can see this by the people he hires as well. They are all polite and informative and don't seem to mind when you take a few extra minutes to decide between the mixed berry GF scone or the GF apple muffin.  And they certainly don't judge you when you decide to have both.  This is a great place for a first date, a friend catch-up, or a pre-show drink. (YES! They have vegan cocktails and they are AMAZING!)"}
{"text":"Three stars for being open 24 hours, but one star for coffee.  Went in with a friend for what we were hoping to be an enjoyable after dinner coffee.   We ordered two hot mochas and it was probably the worst coffee drink we have ever had. The guy working was obviously new. Okay, not a big deal normally, but this guy didn't know anything. I should have known it was going to be a disaster when he asked how much mocha syrup went into my drink.  In the end it tasted like watered down brewed coffee with no mocha flavoring at all. Where was this guy's training? Two mochas $11 and change. Very disappointing!  Also a bit annoyed that they do not offer decaf!   I like to support local, but I probably won't be back here. There is a great 24 hour coffee shop just up the street on Camelback."}
{"text":"Great coffee + occasional live music + wine bar + fun art and style = 5 stars!  Urban bean really increases my love for Phoenix. If you come at the right time, just sitting with your coffee and enjoying the ambiance is very euphoric.  YOU MUST TRY: 1. The wine bar 2. Joyous almond smash 3. Smash me s'more 4. Dark chocolate mocha smash"}
{"text":"Coffee is great, but the AM service is painfully slow. One person to take orders and make orders just doesn't cut it. 20 mins for one drink? I want to ditch Starbucks across the street and make this my go to spot, but unless they can get their AM service figured out, it's just not going to cut it."}
{"text":"There is something to be said for being able to roll out of  bed at any hour and grab a vegan burrito. Even better when it's really good. Even better when the folks that work there (Kristin, I'm looking at you) are buckets of fun to talk to. This place serves food 24/7 and has great beer on tap. You really can't lose."}
{"text":"For a coffee joint there is a surprisingly large amount of space.  Local art lines the walls (and it's for sale), a few locally made items such as coffee cup cozies are also available.  I was happy to find that along with a gorgeous array of pastries ranging from vegan chocolate torte to chocolate pecan pie, there was also an assortment of breakfast and lunch items.  Not only does Urban Beans feature a Sunday Brunch with Omelet bar every Sunday, but there is a wonderful assortment of breakfast items to be enjoyed.   Farm egg sandwiches on toasted english muffins, Market quiche, granola parfait, scones, and even gluten free vegan english muffins.  Furthermore, lunch selections boast a fabulous spread of sandwiches such as the turkey, brie, cranberry sandwich with a fabulous mango cranberry chutney and fresh arugula.  For the salad selection I highly recommend the quinoa mediterranean salad with mini tomatoes, persian cucumbers, feta cheese, fresh mint, and their citrus house vinaigrette.  A more esoteric selection on the menu is the pear and arugula melt, with fresh pears, arugula, fontina cheese, and a balsamic raspberry reduction.  Average price of a sandwhich is about $8, salads and quiches range from $4.50-$7.50.  Melts are about $8-$9.    I have only sampled the Chai latte here, which I thought was beautifully rendered.  Coffee and espresso drinks are abundant here, prices are very reasonable.  Great lunch spot, perfect for browsing the internet with their free wi-fi on a lazy sunday."}
{"text":"First impression:  Coming in i didn't like the parking lot the entrance closet to the building is actually the exit. When I get in two people are waiting come to find they haven't been helped yet. The staff seems to move slow and seems slightly depressed. The food is vegetarian but good. The coffee is good, I had a ice coffee macchiato. It was delicious. Went around 3pm and it wasn't crowded but they are open 24 hours. Will have to try a different time to verify if they are just slow or if it was the time of day."}
{"text":"Good drip coffee and pie, staff is avg. WiFi fast and free. Comfortable seating, pleasant ambient noise."}
{"text":"Love this joint! Great coffee and the apple pie is on point. I also love that this spot is 24 hours. Night or day, this place definitely wins."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch at a great price - all the right ingredients blended perfectly together and the obviously homemade sauce, which for me either makes or breaks an Italian dish, is neither overpowering nor bland. This delightful marinara accents the cheesy vegetable blend making this lasagna to die for!  And at $6.50 the word will spread quickly. I love the atmosphere here and keep being surprised at the interesting dishes they continue to offer."}
{"text":"I've been a regular at Urban Beans through all of its phases...uno, duo and tertio.  The addition of wine and beer has been a welcome surprise.  We stop for coffee, iced drinks and for happy hour...and never been disappointed. Whatever you do, do not try the toffee...if you do, you will become addicted.  The staff is always friendly, the baked goods are as good as you'll find anywhere and the atmosphere is what a coffee house should have.  Landscaping and patio are well done and comfortable...despite being along 7th street, you can carry on a conversation there and be comfortable."}
{"text":"urban beans how I do love thee.  the espresso shots are pulled to perfection and i've never had a bad drink out of the 20 or so i've had so far here. the pastries and sweet treats are delicious. the toffee is to die for. the muffins make me melt. the tabouli and hummus are delish. the bagels are fresh. the goat cheese torte made me lick the plate clean. their smash drinks are amazing and i'm partial to the s'mores one. better than dutch bros sweet coffee treats. hands down.  the best part is that everything in here is locally made and environmentally friendly.  from the cups which are made from corn and totally compostable to the friendly, down to earth staff that makes the place a truly great coffee spot. so many other coffee joints in the area want to claim they are local and environmentally friendly and blah blah blah, but really, the most they can lay claim to is that their coffee comes from somewhere in AZ. virginia, the owner, really prides herself on obtaining everything in the places from locales. with all the coffee options out there, make urban beans your first choice."}
{"text":"Great setting. Great coffee. excellent scones of various fresh berries of the season. My biggest disappointment -the building is dirty .  the bathroom floor  was filthy. clean the patio  too . a little housekeeping would go a long way"}
{"text":"This place is a must for late night study sessions, coffee, great times with friends, and chess! Employee with beard is the nicest!"}
{"text":"Open 24 hours! Need I say more! They also have a little wine bar area. Perfect for a study session, a cup of coffee, or a glass of wine. They have light meal options, and desserts! The coffee is fire! A strong cup of coffee which I love, but not all can handle! Centrally located, which makes it accessible, whenever you need to stay up!"}
{"text":"OMG what a super tasty meal! I had the scrambled eggs (tofu) fried potatoes and Chipotle burrito and it was heavenly. I split a vegan chocolate cupcake with my sister and if I died at that moment it would have been total vegan bliss and I would die with a huge satisfied smile. All my friends are gonna love this place with it's awesome staff, relaxed and beautiful atmosphere. Food is reasonably priced and delicious."}
{"text":"Cute! I love another independent coffee shop in my neck of the woods. The people working there were friendly, but not ingratiatingly so. The menu and prices - on par with other coffee shops. I had to try something to eat, but none of the baked goods had mad shelf appeal. I went for the cardamom coffee cake, which looked about as exciting as burnt white toast. Appearances are deceiving! A sweet, milky vanilla-caramel cake with a thick ribbon of dense, concentrated cinnamon based spice running throughout, all with a thin and barely perceptible glaze on top. Yum yum yum! A little greasy and so definitely not on my every day meal plan, but this will serve nicely for a treat every now and again.   The coffee is average, but I'm no coffee snob. (I am baffled by those who suggest the barista should \"learn to pull a good shot\". WTF?) It's not Starbucks-burnt, so it works for me.   The girl working there (I assume one of the owners) said Fox 10 News was out there yesterday morning, doing a remote report. Cool! I hope it brings them lots of business. It's a good location, in a little strip mall that also has an Aveda salon (who knew?), and just a little out of my way in the mornings. Oh yeah, and they were actually open when I got there a little after 6:30. What's up with coffee shops that don't open until 7 (or later!!!)? I will definitely be adding Urban Beans to my list of morning coffee sources."}
{"text":"Decided to go here instead of my usual place and I was very satisfied. Had something simple, hazelnut latte, but it was very good and the atmosphere was pleasant as well. Look forward to trying their breakfast next time I go."}
{"text":"I was able to visit this hipsterish wifi café on two separate occasions after reading so much about it on Yelp. The horizontal interior has good natural lighting, a front pastry counter, arrangement of tables and high chairs to the left, and a wine bar to the right. Noise level is high, and the clientele includes laptop dwellers, students, and group gatherings.  Kale and Roasted Beets Salad ($9): A good serving of fresh kale, walnuts, goat cheese, roasted beets and red pepper vinaigrette. The composition was tasty, as the mix of creamy goat cheese, crunchy walnuts, fresh beets, and firm beets were delightful. I had this salad on both visits. Quality can be inconsistent between visits, as the kale was slightly yellow on the first try and overdressed and saltier yesterday. I'm likely to try the Quinoa Salad before coming back to order this dish again.  Pear and Arugula Melt ($9): Flat bread layered with fresh pears, arugula, fontina cheese, and dressed with balsamic raspberry reduction. This item is no longer available on the menu, but the inconsistent firm and softness in the flat bread struggled, and the sour balsamic raspberry reduction didn't mix well with the pear. The café will jumpstart a new menu soon, so hopefully the flatbread will be much improved if it's scheduled for a return.  Soy Dirty Chai Latte ($6.34): The latte was sweet with a solid hint of strong espresso and noticeable chai. The price was steep because they penalize diners for the use of soy--even though there is not a whole lot of differentiation to the cost of milk in the supermarket. This was one of the better dirty chai lattes, but also not worth the price.  Green Peach Ice Tea ($2.50): The ice tea was light and refreshing. The mix of green tea and subtle peach flavor was nicely balanced.   Service was personable but a bit snooty. They were very nice to let me sample the Garbanzo Soup and my drinks came out quickly. However, the password for their wifi was \"thankyou\" and my colleague and I were both offended by it. Overall, it was a pricy but convenient place for laptop users and group gatherings.  I'd be interested in coming back to see if their new menu will be any better."}
{"text":"The chocolate chip pear scone was amazing! Also recommend the breakfast burrito #3.  So good that while on vacation we ate here two days in a row!  Staff was amazing. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent place to hang out and have a coffee, beer, or glass of wine.  It's a great little neighborhood hangout spot."}
{"text":"This place is so great, the staff are all super friendly and helpful! They have tons of VEGAN options for food; salads, wraps/burritos, flatbreads, etc. and of course lots of delicious VEGAN desserts too...so amazing to be able to get yummy food 24 hours a day!!!! WIFI also!!! Inside seating & also outdoor patio seating!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is all right, employees not so much. An employee by the name of Christina was swearing and I'm almost entirely sure it's because she's having a bad day. But I don't think it that kind of language should openly be used when it's obvious that there are customers within earshot. While I do realize that it's just the way some people talk, it does not set forth a professional environment."}
{"text":"I had the Jackfruit Carnitas Style Torta.. wow! I'm impressed! I haven't had a hand-held this worthy of praise in years. If everything vegan / vegetarian tasted this good, I'd never go back to eating meat."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing drinks! All vegan! My new favorite cafe. I've been here several times even though I just discovered it, and every time my drinks are made perfectly, and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Got a small caramel toffee mocha and a red velvet cupcake. Also tried a bit of my friend's strawberry scone (she got the same flavour drink). The coffee was really good and smooth - not over roasted or too strong/weak and had a really nice sweet toffee flavour. The cupcake was a little more thick and cold than I prefer (I like my cake more fluffy/airy and room temperature) but was really good and not too sugary. The scone was definitely better, though. The only problem was that the coffees did take a long time to come out and it wasn't that busy, but there was only one barista and I didn't pay attention to the line length. Seems like a great neighbourhood spot, though. There was a live guitar player at the time which was kind of neat but strange on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"I am amazed at how many stars this place has on here, but I am here giving it 3 as well.  I go to this place probably one to two times a week, a convenient location for me and stays open *24 hours.* I imagine it is that plus the young, granola vibe the place has to it that keeps its rating up. If you stop in here once or twice, the atmosphere and yummy vegan treats will probably keep you from seeing the major management issues that are evident to anyone who frequents or has frequented this place..  Every time (and I mean EVERY time) I go in here, there are new employee faces I've never seen before. Not only that, but last week's \"familiar\" faces are gone; I am very curious about the turnover rate here. Just as inconsistent as the employees, are the PRICES (I get the same order every time) ranging from $4 for both drinks, to $8 for both, to $10 or $11 sometimes.. it takes so long to get my drinks and order most of the time that I don't even bother to argue, plus I know it's only going to make things harder on the newbie of the day. The coffee tastes good usually, but I always have to make sure my espresso shot is added or that the drink is made right.   I feel bad saying this as most people working there are young and seem to really be trying; I know it's hard to learn anything when you are trained by someone who really still could use training..   Yet, this place is still very successful.  I've never eaten the cooked food, only the muffins or pastries, but the bakery items are usually delicious and healthy. The artsy feel of this place keeps people coming back in, especially the youngins. Like I said, I go back too, but would never go out of my way for this place and my boyfriend and I know it always takes at least 10 minutes to get our coffees here.."}
{"text":"Overall, great coffee, great food!! Very friendly staff. I had the egg sandwich. Fresh eggs for sure. Cheese. Nothing special. It looked really tiny on the huge plate. Wife had the turkey sandwich. Very generous portion. She loved the soy latte. I had the strawberry smoothie. Pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Stop everything you're doing and go get one of their brownies, warmed up, with an ice cold glass of milk. I'll never be the same."}
{"text":"I decided to go in as it looked like a great place to relax and drink coffee, WRONGOOO I go in and no one acknowledges our presence a simple hello is fine as we are not royalty lol however I decide what I want, I am behind a couple... few moments later they are done but the waitress/cashier never noticed or made it seem like we were next... she goes under the counter starts looking for stuff I guess coffee filters or something.. took her a few to comeback and ring up my one pastry pear almond scone? ... anywho she sets it on the glass counter I swipe and no contact stilllllllll I wait for her to hand me my pastry .. never happens I grab it and say goodbye as a good bye was not given... that's not ALL I split the pastry with my mother and there is a hair!!!! Sooooo I will never buy or enter this facility. :)"}
{"text":"What I like: the coffee, the patio, unpretentious atmosphere, and open all night. I've only been here once (on a late night coffee run) and I hope to return when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Neat little place, quiet enough for a business meeting. Nice patio as well."}
{"text":"I loooooooooovvvveeeeee this place ! Their food is delicious and their staff is thee best !! I love the night crew (:  It's great vibes so makes it easy to keep coming back ! Shout out to Jackie for always taking care of me"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood coffee shop right down the street from my house. I really like that you can come here any time of day and find something you're in the mood for. Good coffee, beers on tap and plenty of vegetarian/vegan options on the menu. I'm a huge fan of the scones and the tofu scramble. I showed up early when the scones were fresh out of the oven and oh man, super good. The service can be a little slow at times, but it's not a big deal if you plan on hanging out for a while anyway. If you're in the area, forget Starbucks and hit this place up instead."}
{"text":"This would be one of my favorite places. It opens 24/7!!!! It is the only place I have discovered so far that it's always open, considering Phoenix is a big city you would think there would be more right?...  Maybe I just haven't done my research. Yummy chai tea latte with almond milk!  They also have a bar, so if you feel like getting comfortable (wine, beer, bourbon, bailey's, etc) but at the same time do some work on your lap top totally possible!"}
{"text":"I love to sit there with my drink and read my stuff. I am so comfortable to be there by myself for hours. Tables outside is nice. The plant in the pots are cute.  All smashes are awesome, especially the one with almonds.  Fruit cake is great (not too sweet)"}
{"text":"So...I want to like this place due to the convenient location.  There were a couple of good experiences - coffee was pretty good, lentil soup was really good.  Service was 'meh'.  But the bad experiences were so bizarre, I don't think I'll be coming back.  1: In a hurry to pick up my sister from work, I stopped by to grab a to-go snack for the both of us.  Goat cheese/pesto/sundried tomato tart?  Sounds delicious!  It was delicious upon tasting it.  However, there were bits of *sharp* broken plastic lodged in the goat cheese, (which, by the way, I chewed on until I realized that it wasn't a really dry tomato, but in fact plastic).  I took a picture, then called to provide a friendly, \"FYI - this happened.  I don't know how this happened, but you might want to investigate.\"  She was friendly enough, but incredulous, (are you sure this didn't somehow magically happen inside the closed to-go bag/box while you were driving?) - lending to the worry that nothing was done in terms of investigation.  I tossed the rest of it, (to the dismay of my hungry sister), for fear of destroying her insides.  2: Upon the next visit, (a week or so later), I stopped in to have the soup, since the lentil was great the last time I had soup here.  They didn't have the lentil, but they did have the roasted red pepper.  When I came to order, the guy at the counter informed me that they only had enough soup left for one cup, and that he wanted it.  I couldn't tell if he was joking, but after a long stare, he placed the order.  When I went to pay, he informed me that I wouldn't have to pay sales tax today because their 'system was down'.  Thanks?  That sounds...a bit unethical, but okay.  Soup finally came out, (was told the reason it took a while because there was work going on in the back).  Delicious, much like the lentil soup.  But as I was eating, I noticed the contractors working in the kitchen were on ladders doing something to the ceiling.  Above where the food is being prepared.   No bits of ceiling in the soup, thankfully.  But wow.  Like I said - very torn.  The food is great tasting, but I shouldn't have to worry about ingesting foreign objects upon each visit."}
{"text":"We love this hidden treasure in the heart of Central Phoenix. The artwork on the walls are really neat. The food is delicious and gluten free. The variety of teas are fabulous."}
{"text":"I know it's \"local\" but there's a reason the Starbucks just to the south is always more crowded. Not exactly the best Caramel Latte I've ever had. I've been here twice, both times I was underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop with great homemade baked goods and excellent espresso drinks and tea. I am here and have been here for 10 hours working, ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and had great internet access and service the whole time. Why you would go to Starbux when you have this across the street boggles my mind. If you hang out here for a while you will literally hear \"I'm going to go make an apple pie\" and similar such statements from the baristas. Plus, they were slow bringing me my lunch (I didn't care and was clearly here to stay) because they were roasting the tomatoes, so they brought me a free drink. Plenty of good seating, great wifi, a good outdoor patio, easy parking, clean bathroom, good art, and hip and good looking clientele of all ages. A little cold in temperature for me but probably good if you're coming in from the blazing sun. Just totally solid all around."}
{"text":"Urban Beans is great!   The best place in DTPHX for a Matcha Green Tea Smoothie. Plus, they Belly which gives you frequent buyer perks :)   Belly:  https://getbelly.com/"}
{"text":"A practical visitor who is staying at a hotel is confronted with the following question each morning: \"Is there something out there worth going to (and paying for!), or do I just resort to the hotel's complimentary breakfast?\"  This place is worth going to--daily, if need be. They offer excellent coffee with a wide variety of creamer options, along with many light and tasteful breakfast items. We tried the \"Mano Poblano\", the \"Farm Delux\", and a brownie; we left satisfied.   They are open 24 hours--jet-lagged visitors from the East Coast won't have to wait for regular business hours."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for a few days and tried two vegetarian restaurants. Urban Beans is far better in quality and taste than the other place (Green New American). The food is excellent. The ambiance like a coffeehouse that invites you to stay as long as you please. I tried the jackfruit carnitas club sandwich (minis the mayo) and my husband (non-vegetarian) had the southwest Caesar salad and said it was one of the best salads he's ever had. We loved it so much we had the same thing for lunch a couple days later."}
{"text":"I feel terrible for writing it a 3-star, but honestly I do not find their espresso or chai teas very good at all. Now, take a look at all the other reviews and people rave about it - so take it as you will, but I will not be returning here for the coffee/espresso. It's a serious bummout for me, because I like most everything else about this place.  However, they have a GREAT selection of loose-leaf teas that smell like heaven. And it's an awesome place to work from - tons of windows with plenty of sunshine and a great patio. You just have to ask for the wi-fi code.   The employees seem genuine and cordial, and I dig the fact that they have open mic nights and live music acts. I dig it as a cool joint to hang out at.  It's a decent location with parking that has never been full for me.   My favorite thing? They sell gluten-free goodies like biscotti and english muffins. Who knows if they rotate their GF selection, but I really appreciate any place that caters to my kind. AND it seems like they have a pretty big menu for a coffee house (like REAL food too).   Summary: coffee? Not my thing here. Tea? Yes, please. Working? Pretty decent. Gluten-free selection? They are trying and that's all that counts."}
{"text":"Great little eclectic coffee house, just down the street.  Prices were reasonable, seating was ample, and the drinks were spot on!  Free wifi is a nice touch.  Loved the outside area, though don't see that being utilized until winter."}
{"text":"Pros: Coffee is great.  Staff is awesome Location Parking space Open 24/7  Cons: Little pricey - both food and beverages compared to similar establishments Damn those chairs ad table. I'm 5'10 and no matter where I sit (at the bar or tables), I can't reach the table comfortably. I come a lot here for studying and I have to keep my shoulders in elevated position to reach the table. And definitely the chairs can be little comfortable"}
{"text":"You killed it - ohhh nooo!!!  They used to make some of the finest Cafe Lattes in town (you know, latte = milk in Italian), but now they're all plant-based, and an espresso mixed with soy milk or almond milk is just awful"}
{"text":"My wife called this morning to see if they would do a side of scrambled eggs. She drove all the way there and when She asked the lady upfront she said they don't do that. She then asked who I'm assuming is the manager and she said oh yeah I remember that call we can do that. My wife was super embarrassed. Then she came out to find that she had a flat tire due to the small entrance she hit the curb. I drove there and change the tire for her and I went into grab a water. The same lady charged me for a cup of water!!! Yeah we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place, great location. Coffee is super good, NOT bright/hipster coffee. Ambience is super chill & mostly quiet during weekend mornings. I got a lot of work done. I like the varied seating options as I do come to work. I can sit or stand. I haven't had their food but it's great that they have a full menu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since I can walk there from my house in the morning, but both times I tried it in the morning the service was horrible. It was a guy the first time and he was either in a bad mood or having a bad day but he was very rude and actually forgot to make my drink I had to remind him once I realized he hadn't even started it (it wasn't even busy.) I was going to drink my drink and eat my scone there but the service was so bad I decided it would be better to walk home and enjoy it there instead. On the up side the vanilla latte was delicious and their scones were great! I just wish the service was friendlier  I went again trying to give it a second chance, but that time it was an older woman and she was distant as well and was having a conversation with another customer the whole time I was trying to order, it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable so I once again just walked home to eat instead of staying there."}
{"text":"You can go and get you some regular ol beans from Starbucks or you can swing over to Urban Beans and grab a cup full of something local and special just for you! I love the feel of this little place. Totally fits the name. Urban and trendy kind of coffee place within the heart of midtown.   The unique drinks you can get here are awesome also! The mocha almond smash and green tea smash are summer favorites for me. The large latte comes with four shots of espresso at a great price for under 5 bucks. They do this movie night one Monday of the month though I can't recal which right now.   All in alljust a great little coffee spot. Try it, you might like it!"}
{"text":"Is this the best coffee place in the Phoenix metroplex area? No but there are a lot of things you can love about this place! The coffee and the rest of the drinks and treats are all Average at best. But do I have anything bad to say about this place? Absolutely not! I finally got to try this place that I heard so much about over Christmas vacation this last year 2016. The area is quiet but not bad and pretty close to the skyline. It's a privately owned place but the coolest thing is that it's one of the only coffee places around that is open 24 hours and it's also open during major holidays.  This is the reason why I went to go check it out in the first place because it was one of the only places open it on Christmas. I enjoyed being with family and friends but I do like to run around town and look for my adventures. This is what I hate about the holidays because everything seems to be closed. I totally understand that you're supposed to be sticking around the house with your family but my family goes to bed fairly early and I like to stay up pretty late especially around the holidays so this is a perfect place to go check things out with all your adventurous Friends and family members like to stay out late.  I wouldn't say it's the quiet type environment but it is subtle enough to do some homework if you need to get that done but also a good date place if you want to get to know somebody but I also like that you can bring small group in here and hang out and just enjoy yourself for as long as you want since it's open all day all night. Bottom line I highly recommend this place because of the hours alone and the service is superb as well. It's a very friendly environment with a neighborhood atmosphere and very artsy as well."}
{"text":"Lots of seats. Open 24/7. The only thing I'd ask for is more outlets near the center section tables away from the walls."}
{"text":"open 24 hours, yes you read that correctly! Need I say more!? Grab an iced coffee to go or hang out inside! They serve food, and booze too! Pretty much the only place you need to be!"}
{"text":"Within walking distance of my office. 'Nuff said.   Okay well there is more. I've gotten accustomed to the whole \"stay in the care in the drive thru\" at places like starbucks, but got tired of doing the same old. Decided to check out Urban Beans...well a meeting brought me here...and was really happy with the experiences. The art is good, the place is a good size and not too overwhelming in sound or furniture, and the folks are nice. Even a nice outside porch for sitting, but that can get a little loud because of the street. I just like plain coffee, and its hot and strong.   I'm a big iced tea person, and they have great ice tea. The tea isn't too sweet, the large is actually large, and the value is definitely there. Plenty of parking too. I'll keep going."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped after the Adele concert to get some strong coffee and hopefully a  tasty chocolate treat to share before our trip back to Tucson.   But alas, no chocolate in the case. We settled on the lemon lavender cake (which I'm sure was yummy) and ordered a couple of lattes, but happened to ask the guy behind the counter if by some chance they might have anything chocolate in the back. He disappeared for a few minutes, and a lovely woman came out and said she'd heard we wanted some chocolate and said, \"We take our chocolate very seriously here.\" -- then told us she was going to make us a special treat and asked whether we preferred light or dark chocolate (definitely dark). Wow. Impressive.  About 15 minutes later, she came out with a beautiful tart made with shortbread crust and a dark chocolate ganache filling, topped with pecans and caramel sauce. Gorgeous presentation, and the taste was beyond heaven -- literally the best dessert I've ever had. The still-warm ganache was deep, dark, soul-satisfying CHOCOLATE. Oh Lordy, we were in hog heaven. We polished that baby off, finished our lattes, and made a speedy and contented trip back to Tucson.   Thanks to the warm and thoughtful folks who work there--you're there best (and your baker is amazing)! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and awesome pastries. The strawberry scone is insanely delicious. Owners are always friendly and go out of their way to remember names and faces.   The homemade cream soda is also a great choice."}
{"text":"I've been here four or five times and never been too impressed. The atmosphere, art installations and eclectic seating gave me high hopes. The location is also unbeatable, walking distance from my place. But the service has always been sub-par, like it's a bother to take my order and converse with me.  Everyone here, including most of the clientele, seem way too cool for school.  The iced tea, my usual, is good; the iced coffee is great-tons of flavor and plenty of body. Espresso drinks are pretty standard for your indie coffee shop. I've asked for their vegan pastry (which changes daily) three times only to be told that they ran out for the day. I know that this happens, and I love that they freshly bake their goodies everyday and have a rotating menu, but I would also like to try the vegan scone sometime please.  Today, I ordered a strawberry-raspberry-cranberry smoothie ($5 for a small!) and confirmed with the boy behind the counter that the smoothies are vegan/non-dairy. He said yes then informed me that they use Naked juices for the base then just add fruit and ice. (Naked juice! So that's where the $5 price tag comes from!) Three minutes later, I was handed a delicious looking smoothie topped with...whipped cream...?  Really?!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today- really great. Fun and funky vibe that reminds me of local coffee places back in Colorado where I'm from."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on Thanksgiving while trying to find a coffee shop that was open. They're open 24/7 - 365 which is awesome if you ask me! The staff was great and the Americano was well done, the atmosphere is sorta hipster coffee shop but nice and comfortable. They have outdoor seating which is always a plus too. Overall, a great experience and definitely a go to for those late night coffee needs!"}
{"text":"I've never felt so valued as a customer as I do when I'm at Urban Beans. Seriously. I didn't think it was possible to feel so appreciated just for regularly stopping in. The people here are great. Although the staff is enough to make this place exceptional, UB is a good choice for many reasons: it's open 24/7, the pastries are delicious(the mocha scone will change your life), the menu is completely vegetarian/vegan, and everything is well-priced. Opt for here instead of the Starbucks next door, and you'll be making the right decision."}
{"text":"Wow.  A very political place.  Very Left side politics.  There was some crazy political party going on when I went to see this local coffee house.   If you are far left and want to see a political Rally this is the place to be.  If you are at the least bit Independent or Moderate I would seek a coffee elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and enjoy made from scratch baked goods and burritos. Excellent and friendly service and a great atmosphere.  Go!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about two years and I still love it. I do an iced, decaf latte (yea, I know it sounds stupid) and their decaf espresso is perfect. Also, they put in the right number of shots on the big drinks to keep from diluting the espresso.   Yesterday, I had the Delux breakfast sandwich. It's such a good little sandwich with a nice aioli and some arugula. It's definitely worth trying if you have been sticking to the basic sandwich."}
{"text":"I really appreciate an all-night cafe in Phoenix, but the menu reads better than it tastes. We tried the pumpkin curry bowl and kale quinoa salad. Everything seemed prepackaged and preserved, very little freshness. The \"legendary\" hummus was just OK. And we were charged for an additional hummus platter we didn't order.  Urban Beans was nice enough to remove the charge, plus a little extra. when we called the next day. Classy."}
{"text":"This is my second time here but my first review the first time I came I got the bean burrito which was super super spectacular and an iced chai! This time I got an iced chai and a banana nut muffin, and I must say their iced chai is probably the best I've ever had (as you can see I keep coming back) lol And the banana nut muffin is to die for! The staff is nice there was two girls when I came in one of the girls was getting yelled at by another customer (not too sure why because she's really sweet and it didn't seem like she did anything wrong) and I was the customer after him and she dusted the situation off like It didn't even happen. I definitely commend her for that!! Only reason why I give this place for out of five stars is because the first time I came in I wouldn't say the staff was rude but they just really weren't that attentive."}
{"text":"I've been here 2x wasn't impressed the first time figured give them a second try. There latte doesn't impress me I'd rather goto the Starbucks adjacent to this spot"}
{"text":"I USED to brag about Urban Beans to everyone I know. I used to hang out there at least 3 times a week. THEN something horrifying happened, my once favorite coffee place changed! & it morphed into something no longer identifiable. I took my mother to Urban Beans, upon walking in the door the entire restaurant was permeated by extreme body odor. Not only was the smell gagging, but all but 1 of the tables was dirty. The only 1 without dirty dishes was sticky. Still, we attempted to order coffee however, a large mocha & a small black coffee was apparently a brain teaser for the barista. Our simple order was messed up twice. We tried again, by ordering bread pudding French toast. Alas, this was again a big mistake. Not only was our food served cold, it came with no utensils. I was so embarrassed I spent the entire afternoon apologizing to my mom. I have never been back nor will I ever go back. PSA-There is a Tip Jar located at the register but beware, our very astute & creative barista automatically added a 15% gratuity to our bill. AND never request a glass of water or you will be pointed to an empty pitcher without a glass to be found within the vicinity of this zip code. Frightful indeed."}
{"text":"Always my favorite coffee shop.  Too bad the baristas remember my fiancé but not me, even though we always come in together. Pfft.  But that's okay. I can take solace in their georgia peach tea and gluten-free/vegan english muffin. Toasted with just the right preserves, it makes my belly happy. I cheated on my diet but that's okay. Just don't tell my doctor.  I have always been a fan of their food. I did knock this down to 4 stars because they seem to have dumped a lot of the vegan/gluten-free options they used to have. Super sad face.  Also, there was a very loud man in there asking for money, yesterday. But he quickly left. Loud conversation is very distracting. It is not the quietest coffee shop if there are many people, but it is still nice!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last week. We were welcomed by a staff member who asked if we had ever been here before--since we hadn't she explained the menu and everything about the cafe. The food, coffee and service was great!"}
{"text":"Ummmm! As a vegetarian, I'm embarrassed I hadn't been here yet and it's a mile from my house!!! I've seen it but figured it was just pastries and didn't have a full menu. I can be an espresso snob, and this was amazing! I stayed and studied for a few hours. I also got the bean, potato, and cashew cheese burrito. It was very good but carb heavy- next time I'll see if they can add greens and tofu. Overall, I'm so sad I hadn't come here before. I will definitely be back- they have alcohol too! The only thing that bothered me was that they didn't have a matcha soy latte, or at least the guy couldn't tell me exactly what was in their version (he said it had dairy). Maybe that's a really fancy drink, and I just wasn't aware."}
{"text":"I just went here for morning coffee for the first time. I ordered a hazelnut latte. The service was very nice and all was well, until I took my first sip later in the car. Ewwww. The coffee is completely burnt. This made my usually slightly sweet latte into a nasty bitter mess of disappointment. $4 later I have to throw this away and buy a new one somewhere else. It's completely undrinkable."}
{"text":"With so many amazing coffee shops nearby, you would think Urban Beans would be trying hard to compete. We stopped in for coffee after leaving Taco Guild, and the coffee was not good at all. We ended up dumping our cups and driving to another cafe. Also, I'm not vegan, and it was only after I ordered that I realized this is a vegan place. I prefer cream with my coffee, so that was another strike for me."}
{"text":"One of the best Americanos in the greater Phoenix area and served in a huge ceramic mug. Let me repeat that: a HUGE mug, and I ordered a small.  After securing a two person table (the tabletop had cool artwork on it) and sitting in a super comfortable chair, I looked into the depths of my Americano and decided that I'd like something from the pastry cabinet to complement the espresso or I'd be flying higher than a kite, which ended up being a blueberry muffin with a strong fresh blueberry flavor. I would have had a scone too but then dinner would never happen. By the way, the lunch menu here looked  awesome, but it was close to 3 p.m. and for me, that means afternoon coffee.  The inside space isn't huge, but the outside patio space is. In fact, just outside my window a man sat eating an awesome looking salad.   I absolutely loved the wall art and the funky tables, but the coffee and the food will have me coming back here every time I'm in the area. Urban Beans, you have my loyalty."}
{"text":"Super chill vibe. Ordered the latte and it was delicious and served very artistically. Will visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Open 24hrs during the week jackfruit sandwiches homemade bbq sauce convenient location.  What's not to like about UB? I am impressed, and aside from finding a strand of hair in my food, they sandwiches is yummies. Love the bread. I'm not sure if it's considered ciabatta but it's very similar. I wish I liked the baked sweets as much, but none of them have tasted good to me."}
{"text":"Came in to try the iced coffee. Very good cold brew. Something was cooking on the flat top that smelled so good, I will be back for lunch. Saw some reviews of paying a high price for the iced coffee, but they must have purchased the 32 ounces because my 16 oz was just about $3, less than the franchise across the street. Glad to know how close this place is to work. Too bad we didn't have more local coffee houses out in north Peoria like this. Great place. Hats off to the owners"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a coffee and lunch to go.  Had the jackfruit torte and it was delicious.  I love the dipping sauce that it came with,.. I would dip everything in that if I could buy it by the bottle , haha... :) The coffee was great too!"}
{"text":"LOVING that we have a cool, comfortable place to work with a patio that has atmosphere.  I wasn't loving the food, but they had a good selection of drinks, teas and smoothies.  The atmosphere is great for working and there are plenty of outlets.  Oh, and the bathroom is very nice - a plus in my book.   Definitely going to be one of my main places to hang out with my computer."}
{"text":"First time there. I bought a bag of toffee pecan at the register I started to nibble on it when I got home I actually ate the whole bag its very very evil in a good way YUM yummmm"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time with some friends in a Friday evening and really enjoyed it.  Friendly staff,  nice feel,  and the chai tea latte was yummy."}
{"text":"Popped in here because a friend and I were looking for some place to hang out and chat after dinner, and I'm so glad I found it! It's like it's specifically designed to make you want to get comfortable and chill for a while. It's not a large space, but we found a booth and enjoyed our drinks and a shared square of cheesecake with lemon custard. I had a raspberry mocha, which was nicely bittersweet, and she finished her large coffee in record time. The coffee really helped cut the richness and sweetness of the cheesecake, which was a bit much for my taste.   The girl working the counter was super amiable, and offered suggestions when we were staring at the menu board in a stupor.  The thing I think could improve my visit are the bathrooms, which weren't messy, but need some TLC."}
{"text":"Mmm their hazelnut latte (iced) is delish. I've tried their chai latte (hot) and I'm not sure if I'm a big fan of it. The first time I came here it was made to perfection, but the other two times it tasted so bland (like drinking warm milk).   Service is always good and they're always willing to take their time to answer any questions that you may have for them."}
{"text":"The barista was incapable of making a mocha or a hot chocolate. I took it back twice and was still bitter and horrible. My boyfriend's caramel macchiato was mixed poorly: all the caramel on the bottom. They were also out of lids..."}
{"text":"Well, I can't say enough about how creative they are here. Featured art Work-friendly atmosphere Talented pastry chef Healthy menu added recently  Still there despite the recent emergence of a Starbucks right next door.  They have been around serving coffee a long  while and even added a bar and 24hour service.  The only downside is their food menu may be out of price range for some older, loyal patrons who want to be more supportive."}
{"text":"Oh, Urban Beans, after 15 visits on various days of the week and at all sorts of times of day, how have I not yet reviewed your awesomeness?  The truth is, I don't really care about your iced tea, which IS tasty, and I don't really care about your Caprese sandwich (which I have devoured numerous times).  What I REALLY, really love...  is your muffins.  You are magic with the muffins.  I have had every flavor you sell, I think, and each one has been more delicious than the last, with my favorite being the raspberry mango.  I always tell myself I will save some for later.    Turns out later is about 15 seconds after \"before.\"  Thank you for allowing me to have my dogs (both big and small) on your patio.  Thank you for understanding that I prefer four-legged children to two.  Thank you for having doable business hours, great prices, and EVEN for having irresistible homemade pasta in your establishment for me to take home and cook later.  I just love you, Urban Beans!"}
{"text":"I really want to support local, but when owners or managers are setting otherwise sweet employees up for failure it makes it hard. When someone has to spend 10 bucks on a drink it needs to be consistent. Friendly counter people with little to no training not even a recipe, or the right ingredients.  You never know what your drink will taste like even when you order the same thing, depending on who is working that day. And to not stock the shop with everything you need and still charge the same outrageous price makes no sense. I'm done trying. No offense to the working staff, but they are being failed."}
{"text":"Urban Beans has very quickly become my fave coffee shop in Phoenix. It's locally owned, unique, good food and coffee, great service, free WiFi, and awesome hours. All of these bode well for a full-time employee + grad student. On weeks when I have an exam, you can find me in here nearly every night.    They have a Sunday brunch, and always some tasty snacks (quiche, muffins, scones, cookies, etc.) and even breakfast items. Vegan options are available also.   There's a wine bar also!   I love the quirky furniture and artwork (which is for sale, by the way). I love giving my patronage to locally-owned businesses, and this is a really good one."}
{"text":"So this is my first time coming to Urban Beans with my mother and I had high hopes for it but apparently too high. My mother and I both ordered pumpkin pecan scones and I ordered a iced latte. The pumpkin pecan scones texture was good but it didn't taste anything like pumpkin and only really tasted like a flavorless scone with pecans in it. So usually I get iced lattes at least once or twice a week at different coffee shops that I normally go too and I expected this iced latte to taste as good or even better than my other ones but I was extremely disappointed with this one especially. First of all, the lady who made the drinks was extremely sloppy with making them and she made my drink spill all over the counter and it was dripping on the side of my cup and I had to clean it up myself. She didn't even put a lid or straw in it for me I had to do it myself too. The taste in the latte was horrible too. The coffee shop was so sloppy and we ordered for here but they put our scones in a to-go bag and the cashier even forgot to bring us up. Overall I am disappointed with this cafe and most likely would not come back here or even recommended it to anyone."}
{"text":"One of the things I truly love about Phoenix is their coffee culture and when it's supporting small, local businesses I support them 100%  Urban Beans is a coffee shop that not only serves coffee, but has a wine bar and pastries. There's ample amounts of space to sit inside and a patio facing 7th street that's great for lounging.  Ordered a Chai Latte and tried Anthony L.'s Latte- the pours are generous! Don't let the lack of latte art fool you, their coffee is bold and true. I enjoyed my Chai, it wasn't watered down like how it is at Lux and had a good amount of spice that wasn't too light nor spicy- sorry extra spicy Chai lovers. It tasted like Christmas and felt like a hug from the inside out.  Definitely a great spot!"}
{"text":"It's so sad to me that people line up at Starbucks across the street when there's Urban Beans, a great LOCAL coffee shop at the corner of 7th St & Osborn in downtown Phoenix. I've enjoyed everything from their fresh, handmade scones, biscotti, coffee cake and quiche to yummy chai and espresso drinks. I've been coming here for 3+ years and will always return for the warm ambiance and super friendly service. Oh and they have free wi-fi, a cute wine bar, great happy hour and lunch/dinner savory options too. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My favorite coffee house ever!  It is so rare that there is a coffeehouse that isn't musty, pretentious, dark, metal-toned, or all of the above!  There was plenty of parking, and I came out of Urban Beans happier than going in.  I walked into a nice open, bright, inviting environment.  One table had a meeting going on; another had web browsing; and another had one person moleskine writing.  I walked in, and the two baristas were so non-pressure, friendly, and nice.  They recommended their version of the frappe, and it was so worth the $5.  Do NOT skip the whipped cream.  That is the best part.  I rarely order dairy drinks or whipped cream, but this whipped cream was so fresh and light and almondy.  So good!  I loved sitting down and seeing the whites and wood-tones and little oil candles and fresh flowers at each table.  I am not sure how busy this place is in the morning or early afternoon or weekends, but my experience was A-plus!  I want to move next door to Urban Beans!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood stopover and stress relief.  Uncomplicated but complex.  I enjoy sitting outside, taking in an eclectic array of things artfully strewn about.  My favorite bites are desserts. Looking forward to other fare beyond breakfast crafted to pleaseand, and takes time. Yum! Assistance with selection and pairing have been great with each visit. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, but the woman making the coffee was extremely rude (woman with short dark hair). Won't come back...I think if you hate your job that much and act like that to people you're in the wrong industry."}
{"text":"I liked this place, it had a cute little vibe. Open 24 hours!!! Coffee was great & their french toast was also TO DIE FOR."}

{"text":"An industrial-chic bungalow built just inside of the Coronado Historic District that showcases a loved downtown in an urban setting. The art and people are always beautiful.  Cappuccino, along with Caffe Latte are my two most common espresso drinks. This one today gets four shots of espresso. The cup is huge. The drink is excellent."}
{"text":"So happy they finally went all vegan !!! I just wish they offered items without soy / tofu (yes-I understand how common this is). Good chill atmosphere on patio yummy lemonades pictured is hibiscus lavender lemonade"}
{"text":"why go to Starbucks when the Bean is right here on the same corner???  Sweet people and good fresh food and coffee. My fav local brew."}
{"text":"First time here, and I'm pleasantly surprised. Amazing customer service that's able to guide the causal coffee drinker. They're not afraid to ask you questions to ensure your drink is perfect. The atmosphere is cozy with a bit of hipster sprinkled throughout. Business suits, don't let the word hipster scare you, it's very fitting for that away-from-the-office meeting. More comfortable seating condusive to accomplishing your to-do list would have earned a fifth star."}
{"text":"My friend had been insisting we go to Cinnabon but I suggested this place. She beat me there, was halfway through a cinnamon oat scone, rice krispy treat and a coffee, and was so pleased with everything that she proclaimed all meetings will henceforth be at local coffee shops. That's a big deal for her to abandon Cinnabon!  So - Urban Beans is a cute little coffee shop. Ample seating inside, cute art on the walls that's for sale, and a really nice little patio outside.   I had a soy white mocha and a java chip scone, and it was only $7.50  That would run $10 at the big green mermaid!  Both were really really good.   They aren't doing made-to-order food anymore, which is what I think most bad reviews are about. The pastries are all freshly baked though.  Only thing that could be better is put some music on or something. It was deathly quiet and I felt like everyone else was listening to our conversation. We moved outside because of that."}
{"text":"I love this place!! UB is everything a coffeehouse should be. Friendly staff, great coffee, and from what I saw, yummy eats. This is a great place to just sit and have a drink, or come to get some work done while you sip/nosh on something delicious. The atmosphere is bright and there are beautiful, artsy mandalas currently on the walls. There's an outdoor patio and a rack to lock up your bike. I can't think of anything this place is missing, hence the five stars...  Overall, if you want a great cup of coffee and a very pleasant caffeine experience, head to UB."}
{"text":"The best coffee and food.  Try the Raspberry Mocha  Smash with Raspberry Drizzle and whip cream, anazing!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here was for lunch. Not knowing it was a vegan place, I still ordered.  It was some type of empanada with veggies and pesto inside. I think it could have been good,  but the bottom of it was hard as a rock. Thank goodness it came with a sauce, that made a world of difference. Also, not having been here before I sat down thinking that our food would be brought to our table. Well 20 min later, with an almost empty restaurant, we had to go check on our food.   I did not post a review that time and decided I'd go back and try their coffee since I consider myself quite the coffee snob. I always judge a place by their ability to make a latte, and although I have had better lattes, I still am giving this place 3 stars. Which is generous considering how I really feel. But young lady behind the counter was chipper and talkative for it being so early in the morning, so three stars they get. Also, I understand that they are open 24 hrs. So if I ever find myself roaming around in the middle of the night needing espresso (or a beer) I'll stop by again."}
{"text":"I'm going to up my review for Urban Beans to five stars. The music generally seems to have improved, but more importantly, the weekend brunch offerings are awesome. In addition to a la carte items, UB offers a great multi-course breakfast, with your choice of side, main dish (including custom omelet), coffee and adult beverage (choice of mimosa or bloody mary). I don't remember the exact price but it's around $15 and worth every penny. And, if I'm going to have to be a coffee shop working on Sunday, it's awesome to be able to get a real breakfast and not just a pastry. Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"This week the Jolly Diners went to Urban Beans on 7th St., Phx. It's an intriguing place because it's one of the few that is open 24/7, and that serve vegan food. The place is small and according to the staff has been there for 7 years, so that must be doing things right. I ordered a #1 breakfast burrito with tofu scramble added to the burrito. Mom ordered over-easy fried egg with roasted potatoes. My sister had a veggie wrap.The menu really doesn't have appetizers, but to start with we had an Alise Caprisce with tofu and tomato on bread, with balsamic vinegar. There was way too much balsamic vinegar. They didn't have any Diet Coke or Pepsi so it was water or coffee or some kind of a fruit drink. Even with some downsides, when the food came it was actually quite delicious; the chef having done a stellar job of preparing burritos and veggie wraps. Overall the Jolly Diners rated Urban Beans a 3 out of 5. This is a place for students to have a quick meal and coffee at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Iced dirty chia with cinnamon, a bean, egg, chz, potato, mano-poblano burrito, a mano-poblano with bacon muffin, pear scone , carrot cake, mint mojito (kale, apple, mint, ?). A vegan/vegetarian joint that is open 24/7. Can't beat that with a stick!"}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito with egg is excellent, so is the pumpkin curry! Friendly staff. Food takes a little while to make so it's best to call it in if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"I'd say I'm a regular at this place. I'm here at least twice a week, but tonight was absolutely horrid. I waited over 45 for my drink and a berry scone which was burnt. The wifi was out and when I asked about my order I was given attitude instead of an apology. I'm sort of disappointed."}
{"text":"What I Loved: -dog friendly patio -good brew of coffee and Americano  -free coffee refills when you check in (a bug flew in my Americano while I was chilling' in the patio before I could finish it so they were kind enough to make me a new one for free with my yelp check-in SO AWESOME) -Super friendly staff -Yummy New Yorker Quiche -Delish Scramble plate   It's my new go to coffee spot which I can bring my fur baby to and grab a light snack as well!"}
{"text":"It's in a good location and works well enough as a cafe. They share their location with a wine bar that starts serving in the afternoon. It would make a pretty good date location. Depending on who you get at the counter service can be either stellar or almost laughable."}
{"text":"Mad respect for a 24 hour coffee shop. Only suggestion is for some background tunes!!"}
{"text":"Coffee here is pretty legit. School place to hang out with friends drink coffee and also they serve a lot more than just coffee. They also serve wine and other drinks as well. It's pretty cool set up. I would totally recommend this coffee shop Over Starbucks any day!!!!"}
{"text":"To my knowledge, there is only one other 24-hour coffee house in the greater Phoenix area  (The Grand near ASU downtown), and in general only a handful of other coffee shops open past 8PM. So that right there gives them stars on stars.  As a student usually working after hours, I usually go with UB over the grand because  1. 24-hour breakfast burritos  2. more light = less drowzy  3. It doesn't turn into a poppin bar after 7:00 (though sometimes this is the main reason I would choose the Grand instead).     UB has an AMAZING vegan pastry/food/ice cream selection as well as a fun cocktail menu. The drinks are alright, but that is where the 4 stars/5 comes in for me. Example: I love a good date shake and I've ordered theirs three times with different results each time... but unfortunately all sub-par. Their iced teas are excellent however, and no complaints about any of the espresso drinks I've ever ordered, though sadly nothing to write home about.   The other reason I gave 4/5 stars concerns the staff. There's some fantastic people working here, but that hasn't been my experience across the board. Excellent customer service appears (to me) to be based more on person-to-person character than on company training. Most of the time I have no qualms, but on occasion there is an aloof or indifferent attitude on the other side of the counter. But, to their credit, if I was working at 2AM I probably wouldn't be all that excited either.   The primary UB assets that keep me coming back are location (proximity to Buffalo Exchange is a BIG plus ;) ), open 24hrs/7 days a week, a chill atmosphere (live music sometimes), the huge 24-hr vegan-friendly menu, and consistent wifi. Also, maybe a dumb thing to add, but I work in a coffee shop that doesn't have an in-house bathroom, and UB has two... so if you're on a study marathon, no fear- you're not away from your laptop for long.  Would definitely recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"Been here way more than a few times, I don't drink coffee so I usually get a smoothie or cream soda as a drink. Their food is also perfectly proportioned and delicious. I love the salmon melt and the turkey sandwich is also very good; they put any cheese on it as long as you ask!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Americano's and Urban Beans makes a great one! The barista's were very friendly, the pastries all looked delicious and one of them definitely was. They also serve beer and wine later in the day which makes me want to go back later. Nicely decorated with art, the weather this morning was beautiful so we sat out doors on the patio. One draw back today was that one of the bathrooms was out of order and the other needed a small amount of cleaning. All in all I was a great experience and I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, their menu is awesome packed with variety and they can make ANYTHING on their menu vegan. They have free wifi, decent prices, exceptionally spacious seating (inside and out), and best of all, they're open 24/7.   Unfortunately, I am unsure if I had caught them on a bad night or not but my experience here was not up to my standards, even with all the great perks. I ordered multiple items and they were out of the non baked items I wanted. I then jumped to order baked goods and their oven was down. So then, my sister and I settled on some drinks.My sister and I wanted a lattes, and seeing a picture of a latte on the counter, we pointed. The gal responded with \"it won't look like that by the way\" talking about the free poured milk, way to kill the vibe lol. I got a raspberry Italian soda taking the recommendation from the barista,  and my sister ended with an iced chai tea latte. The drinks weren't bad, nor were they superb, so I wouldn't go out of my way getting them. We really wanted something to munch on so she recommended the hummus plate with pita and our total came out to be about $15. Also, as we were waiting on our order, we continuously heard them telling other customers that they were out of ingredients.   The hummus plate came out with really chunky and really cold hummus and stale room temperature pita bread that wasn't warmed all the way, on a bed of spinach.   I wish the perks of this place could bypass all the negatives for me, but I really think one visit it good enough for me."}
{"text":"I thought our drinks were good, but the atmosphere was a bit cold. I would drive another two miles to get coffee elsewhere."}
{"text":"Really was looking forward to trying a new coffee shop close to home, however left feeling disappointed with my location of choice! The baristas were lacking in knowledge of menu and manners and seemed disinterested in myself and other customers' needs. The dog-friendly patio was the best thing about the entire place! Dismal service and bland java. Would not recommend over other local coffee shops"}
{"text":"This morning I was craving some tea so I decided to stop in here and treat myself, first timer. I had the peppermint hot tea and I noticed on their menu they had vegan options. I asked the gentlemen in the front and he said they are completely a vegetarian restaurant with a lot of vegan options. He also informed me of their vegan lunch options. I came back and tried the smoked tofu sandwich with nut cheese and my gosh, it was SO delicious!!! I give this restaurant 5 stars, I almost wasn't even going to stop in but I am so glad that I did!"}
{"text":"Guys! If you havent tried their MaTcha FraPpuccino please do because they Have the best of all!! Plenty of Vegan options and amazing pastry. Oh and my favorite hot dish is the Curry stew if you are in to spicy food I highly recommend it. Their burrito are also legit the jackfruit one with the tofu scramble is a winner. Enjoy! Super cute patio and ambiance as well perfect to chill when you are not in the rush :)"}
{"text":"I just bought a chai tea latte.  The description said \"spices stretched five ways.\"  I paid $5 for a small chai latte (including 18% tip and almond milk sub).  I watched the barista steam the milk and add a couple pumps of a syrup.  That's it.  Why the unnecessary fancy description of \"spices stretched 5 ways\"? Why charge people $5 for 8 ounces of hot milk and 2 pumps of syrup??  This is the kind of thing that infuriates people about coffee shops."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Ordered a nonfat chai latte with shot of espresso, not too complicated. The chai was bitter due to the herbs not being strained out which also made it gritty- a very unpleasant texture in a drink. The only pluses about this place is the decor & patio. Didn't try any food but it looked good."}
{"text":"I like the overall ambience of this coffee shop. It has a sense of serious coffee and work feel to it. Lots of laptops and discussions going on. I ordered a large vanilla latte with whole milk. No problem. It was served in a huge ceramic cup. Awesome. And it tasted great! Because I had heard (read on yelp) that the food here was excellent, we decided to order a scone. At three o'clock in the afternoon, the choices were slim and we had to settle for a blueberry muffin. This was very moist and the blueberries had great flavor. You can also buy a beer or a glass of wine here so everyone who comes here should be able to get what he/she wants. The art on the walls is a great experience enhancer."}
{"text":"my wackass chinchilla head with one working ear due to a sickness  was craving some soup. I said to the hubby hey let's get some soup so I can not feel like I'm dying anymore and get some relief for my shitty cold or whatever shit I have (the docs won't tell me, it's a scheme to kill us all or force us upon $100 copays) so hubby finds this fine establishment. they had pumpkin curry soup. sick. can't wait. so we get in there and the guy is nice, great customer service there. so then I'm paying and I realize it's $20 for two soups...,,,,(=??)?  (sorry the face is a shortcut in my phone)  my crumby chimp ass could have went to the store and gotten a $1 can of Amy's soup which would have filled me up more and been more edible than this skunk  diarrhea. the taste wasn't that BAD but for $20 I expected a bowl bigger than what was served (probably about the size of a newborn mouse foot) I expected this shit to be Jesus's piss for $20. nope. could've found some free sewage instead. so yeah completely overpriced and just pretty ridiculous so if you're into that check this place out. damn vegans and their potato sack shoes. im back to eating meat from now on. i am eating a rib as I type this."}
{"text":"I love this place: chill atmosphere, friendly service, and delicious caffeinated and/or alcoholic beverages. Not only is it open 24/7, the drink menu is full of creative flavors and delicious coffee. I fell in love with the Joyous Almond which is a mix of their toddy iced coffee, mocha, coconuts, and almonds - bits of coconuts and almonds come in your drink, and a regular is about the size of a Venti at Starbucks, with much more taste and not at all the over priced tag to it.  The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable, (at least the ones that come between 9-12). They'll give you tastes of the beers and recommendations, and hook you up if they're out of something with the coffee drinks. There's lots of seating, and this sounds so small, but the fact that all their chairs have comfy cushions on the backs, is amazing. When you sit for long periods of time working, this makes a huge difference for back problems. As for the clientele, I've seen a mixture of students, healthcare workers, gay guys, and old timers. Basically anyone and everyone could walk through the door, and that's pretty awesome."}
{"text":"This is the best place ever. The customer service is amazing. The staff treats everyone who walks through the doors with such kindness. The 24/7 food is amazing. The pumpkin and panang curry is so delicious, so are the breakfast burritos and the pastries. I've spent so many hours studying here and it actually makes cramming for exams less miserable.... which says a lot :) Best cafe in phx hands down!! I tell everyone I know about this place."}
{"text":"Didn't stay long as the environment was not very inviting and there was not much of a food selection."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Urban Beans on my way to work to treat myself to a local establishment's cup of joe (versus stopping at the brand new Starbucks a block away) and I'm glad I did. I ordered up a nonfat vanilla latte, iced and the gal that made it made it perfectly! The flavor is all there and the espresso--delish! I also ordered the farm egg sandwich. While it was good, I probably wouldn't order it again. The egg is mixed with peppers and spices to give it a kick but it wasn't my cup of tea. The sandwich was supposed to come with an English muffin but I actually think I was given a bagel. When you're trying to watch your carb intake, it was just too much bread.  This all said, I rate this joint 4 stars. coffee is 5 but the sandwich portion knocked it down one. I'll stop back in again for some coffee and after 10 visit, their loyalty program will give me 10% off!"}
{"text":"Me: What's the wifi password? Him: 'thankyou'\" all lowercase. Me: Thank you Him: that's right Me: No, I mean thanks Him: No, thank you Me: Right, I'm just to say thank YOU for giving me the password Him: Saying it to me won't help though, you'll have to type it into your laptop Me: You're funny Him: thank you Me: ...is the password. Got it.  Only at Urban Beans do you get a complementary Abbott and Costello routine with your coffee. One of my fav new spots. Love it."}
{"text":"We went here because my college-age kids said it was one of the best coffee shops in Phoenix. Key word: WAS. As we started to order, the order-taker must have been new because she had to consult the barista on every item she entered/ordered. The shop was missing items from cups to syrups (no white chocolate mocha) and hardly had any assortments of food. To top it off, the bathrooms were completely disgusting--not clean and no hot water for hand washing--ewww.  This shop has the potential for being outstanding because the decor is nice & customers like to support small business coffee shops instead of major chains. This shop needs to hire the right people and pay them to make a difference. Being located right next to a Starbucks, this shop should not give customers a reason not to come back. Remember, for every 1 person who complains, statistically there are 26 who go away and never come back."}
{"text":"My favorite late night, study spot! I can't even count how many times I've been here. With friendly staff and yummy café drinks, as well as some alcoholic beverages and yummy treats, this place is definitely a go-to. Love having some delicious vegan options, the jack fruit bake is my number 1!"}
{"text":"Last two times I have been here it is very dirty. Dead flowers on the counter, dirty plates, dirty floor. Hey, the coffee is good but the place just isn't clean. Seems to stay busy though."}
{"text":"I was never a big fan of Hazelnut, but my friend told its good, try it.. so what did I do? I got the hazelnut latte. Ahhhhh mayyyy singggggg. :)) not only that, the chai latte is superb, and the caramel latte. Basically I Can go on and on. Hehe   Great atmosphere,  wonderful friendly staff and suoer clean. I came here one time to get away and read. Haha yes. It was perfect."}
{"text":"I finally detoured myself down 7th St yesterday morning and stopped here.  Got a great iced soy latte and a mango scone.  Yum.  Stopped there again today and got a hot soy latte and a cranberry walnut scone with lime glaze...seriously yum.  Cute place, good art, friendly staff, easy parking, great soy lattes, great scones = my new favorite coffee shop.  And free wi-fi and a lovely patio!"}
{"text":"Came here for a double shot of espresso.   Very clean taste and liked the smoothness of the espresso.    Can't go wrong and it's close by the office!"}
{"text":"Swung by this place and the service was excellent.  Very friendly guys behind the counter and in the back-of-the-house.  The only food I tried was their balsamic pear flatbread, which was a nice combination of salty and sweet.  They had a variety of housemade baked goods and their coffee/wine selection seems to be a major focus. Casual and comfy place(with outside seating) to study or go meet up with a friend for coffee/small bite."}
{"text":"The BEST coffee place I've ever been to. The staff is always friendly and often hilarious. The drinks are delicious and everything is reasonably priced. I love that they sell local art and the atmosphere is perfect. They even have chess if you need something to do besides the internet. My fiancé and I had our first date here and if we hadn't moved to Gold Canyon, we would still be visiting constantly."}
{"text":"Pretty diverse menu, with good vegan and gluten-free options.  Decent service. Very laid-back vibe; it's a good place to spend an hour or two, but don't expect to quickly run in and out with your morning coffee."}
{"text":"Nowhere else in the PHX metropolitan area can you satisfy your midnight and beyond vegan cravings. Sandwiches and desserts, 24/7, baby!  I have not yet strayed from my usual Jackfruit Torta entree, so I don't know what their other vegan options are like, but the Jackfruit is bomb! It's flavorful and filling. I always get my order with a side of plain chips.    Don't forget to ask about the vegan desserts. Some are labeled, but not always.  And I've learned that the employees are not all educated on what is and isn't vegan, but one of the co-owners informed me that their apple pies are always vegan. I'll have to try the apple pie a la mode next time!  I have tried their brownie a la mode and their homemade toffee. Yum!   The parking lot is small and fills quickly. Prices are reasonable.  The patio is small but charming.  Did I mention that they're open 24/7??!  If they sold vegan pancakes, they'd be the hipster Denny's/IHOP."}
{"text":"So I have been coming into this coffee shop for a few months.. enjoyed the atmosphere and everyone is nice.  Went in today ordered my coffee and I enjoy just a touch of cream.. I was told the place went all Vegan.  Really,  Almond milk with my coffee.. not sure if they changed their beams also but this was the WORST cup of coffee I have had since I stopped buying coffee at Starbucks..  Sad as I really enjoyed the place butI will NEVER. One back  and will also make sure my friends are updated with the new Vegan change."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite coffee shops to visit. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful especially Axil!!  The vegan options that are also offered are pretty ama zing. This is also a great place to get some study time in. And did I mention they are open 24x7...whaaatttttt!!!!"}
{"text":"A new fave place to set up shop, enjoy REALLY good coffee/espresso drinks, and get some work done with super-fast wifi!  The pastries have all been tasty and they have a good variety that changes along with the chef that is there each day.  And a special shout-out to the quiche that is ridiculously good.  The baristas are extremely personable and highly consistent.   When the weather cools a little, I look forward to getting some work done outside during the daytime under their covered patio.    Love it!"}
{"text":"When I first moved here and started eating there the food was great when the manager would always come through and save the day. I've gotten a free meal twice because of how terrible the employees are. The management has changed and so has the menu but they have the same terrible employees with nasty attitudes. One time I called in an order for two burritos and she was very rude to me on the phone and wouldn't even give me my total or a n estimated time. When I arrived they ended up only making one and the same employee that took my phone order gave me a lot of attitude for their mistake and tried to blame everything on a rush that was no longer there. So the manager had to comp my meal because of how bad the cashier's attitude was. He even had to send her to the back. The food is always dry now and they raised the prices and changed the menu and it is not great at all I can't find anything that I enjoy to eat there any more so I have stopped going there. This is a full year of service in one review from me. Just shitty!"}
{"text":"I have been to Urban Beans twice... once several years ago and again a couple months ago.... and they are very close to my house...so that says something. Their coffee just isn't very good. I believe they use expressions roasting (same as bikini beans) and the quality of their lattes just aren't fabulous. The last time I tried UB I had their 'spicy' dirty chai.... it just wasn't anything special. They get their 3rd star for their fabulous hours, but if I needed a coffee, and it wasn't the middle of the night, I would definitely go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I come to the establishment very often. It's a very laid back environment. Tonight, while enjoying my coffee, I witnessed a disturbance. A very angry and impatient customer came in with her family. The woman threw a fit after waiting 1 minute for a wine. The two staff members handled her nastiest in the best way. Even as she left with she yelled a homophobic comment and attempted to make scene in hopes to turn away customers. I hope she sees this and checks herself on her nasty and unacceptable behavior. And this is coming from a millennial."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours has goodies and decafe espresso. Works for me. Not fancy, but most important is the decafe the soy and almond milk."}
{"text":"Three stars for the food ONLY, customer service is awful!!  The girl at the counter had no idea what she was doing, the guy who appeared to be the leader there was cold and just there to take an order. I wish this place would've been more homey!! Ps their wifi is good. And 24/7. Even the girl I was with, who recommended the place, said \"it used to be better.\" Booooo."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The people working here were very friendly but they were out of chai, quiche, and rosemary potatoes. They didn't even know about some of the stuff we tried to order. When I ordered the scrambled eggs and potatoes the barista came and said they were out of the potatoes but I could get anything else I wanted. I ordered an English muffin to go with my eggs. But only the English muffin came. They don't seem to have a clue as to what products and meals they offer and we will not be coming back. Oh ya. I ordered a strawberry shake, and was given chocolate. They are clueless."}
{"text":"These drink are amazing and the food looks amazing. Their customer service is great I would eat here any day! Strawberry Smash paired with a granola parfait and a Southern Tropic paired with scramble breakfast!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past month and will definitely be back. It's GeekVille. I mean, I was waiting for my date to show up and heard all about how Batman came to be or something like that. AND I heard people talking about Dungeons and Dragons. (Which was one of the causes for my divorce, but I don't hold it against other people, just my ex-husband.) There are a bunch of tables outside and two different rooms inside. One is set up like the computer lab in high school. Lots of laptops here! I love their iced tea. I get it every time. I know it sounds lame to include iced tea in a review, but I like it. I don't get the fancy schmancy flavored kind, either. I'm a purist, I guess. Staff is super friendly, too.  You need to ask them for the key to the bathroom, as it's outside, off the patio. They're really clean, too. On weekends, it's open 24 hours!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and I have been very interested in trying this out. They have also certificates on Restaurant.com but I did not purchase one. I definitely have my favorite coffee shops but I am always open to adding another one to the list. I took my daughter with me, along with some children's books to read on a rainy, AZ day. I got myself an sugar-free vanilla nonfat latte and my daughter a kids hot chocolate. I had to repeat my latte order like 3 times to the male employee and after I got it, waited for it to cool down and took a sip, I realized they never added the syrup. Pretty annoying given how many times I had to remind the guy what I ordered as he rung me up. The lady who made my daughter's hot chocolate added whipped cream and chocolate syrup and didn't make it too hot, which I really appreciated. My daughter still ended up spilling it on her white shirt. What I was thinking???? A 3 year old, hot chocolate and a white shirt?? Aahhh, the never-ending lessons of a new mom. Since I forgot to bring a snack for my daughter, I ordered a blueberry muffin for her and a chocolate chip cookie for me. Both were extremely good. The total for the drinks and food were just under $9 which I think is standard. As I looked in the display case, at the food, there was a pretty good variety. As other reviewers mentioned, the chairs are mismatched throughout. I found a table with a comfy chair (all of the other chairs were the standard, hard, wooden) since I planned to have my daughter in my lap as we read.   Overall, I would say I enoyed my time here (besides the drink mistake). I wish they had some arm chairs or couches or something but maybe they will in the future. There were alot of people here so U.B. seemed to be popular. I'm not sure if I would come back but maybe. I'm intrigued by the BYOB and the variety of events they have."}
{"text":"I come here a lot and about 50% of the time my order is screwed up! Today two out of my two drinks were wrong! Ugh, am I going to go back to fix them? No cause it took 30 mins. for the first order! So frustrated! I'm not demanding either. I asked for unsweetened on one drink and no whip and one less pump on the other! Hire more help please! Obviously they are too overwhelmed!"}
{"text":"Just Love this place! My hair stylist is in the same parking lot, so when I was hungry last time it was the closest place and the most healthy. They offered this great market salad! A combination of 3 salads. One included  fresh sliced Strawbrries. They were so sweet and juicy. Yum!! They also had a variety of Quiches. I choose the mushroom/spinanch quiche. OMG to die for!! Then I also got the apple tart pie, which was excellent! I love deserts and you can tell they used fresh ingredients. I would recommend this place to most people especially if you like to remain on the healthy side when eating out, but also have a sweet tooth. Like myself. There is a great selection to choose from for the desserts. Oh and when you order in, the presentation of the food is picture perfect. I've ate there twice and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Urban Beans has a beautiful set up. There is amazing art inside all over the walls, with all different tables and chairs. The wine bar has a very nice set up also. The ouitside is a nice place to sit when the weather is nice and cool. It has a casual atmosphere. All of the people that work there are so nice! They seem to really like their job. The food there is delicious! Their drinks are good as well. I love stopping in to get a bite to eat and a drink. I like bringing my laptop to get some work there. The atmosphere is peaceful and quiet. I'd recommend Urban Beans to anyone who enjoys coffee and fresh food! Yum!"}
{"text":"Everything is bomb, everything vegan anyway. They have chicken menstruated stuff I won't eat. 24 hours of super cool too."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here.  There's a cool patio area with an herb garden (no, not that type of herb, you goofs), big comfy pillow-couches, and a few outlets.  Both times we've come here, we've been around near closing time, and both times the staff were super chill about it.  The first time, we were told that we were fine finishing our drinks outside while they cleaned up the inside of the place and started to close up (we ended up chatting with them about local bars); the second time, we hung out outside while they closed, cleaned, and reopened again for a band later that night.  It's a relaxed, friendly atmosphere, and the people who work here feel like genuinely good people.  No pretentiousness at all.  As for the coffee, I know it's probably super unhealthy, but I love the Dark Chocolate Mocha Smash.  With whipped cream.  Lots of whipped cream.  Try it, but don't sue me when you get diabetes later in life.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"I got a breakfast burrito and I thought I wouldn't finish it because it was pretty big, but it was really good besides the fact that it was vegan."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere excellent coffee great staff great deserts looking forward to come back again !"}
{"text":"Wow! That's all I have to say. From the service, to the food, to the chai tea latte I got, it was all awesome! Nick and Jeff were inviting and fun to get to know - and they make awesome food. Thanks for the great experience, guys! We'll be back."}
{"text":"The barista here (bearded guy, didn't get his name unfortunately) is the best. I imagine he must have gone to the top of a coffee mountain and learned the secrets of a trade from an old monk, because the latte he made me was the best I've ever had.   I also highly suggest going for the #3 breakfast burrito if that's your persuasion!"}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly, and they go out of their way to make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"This place is walking distance from me. It's the only 24 hour cafe I know of in this city. The coffee is decent. I haven't tried the food. They also have beer and wine which is fantastic. The inside is decorated well. The patio outside is really nice but only during times when it's not busy on noisy 7th st - especially the obnoxious loud motorcycles (which should have been made illegal a long time ago). Anyway, very cozy space to work, chill or chat. The people working here are very nice too. Why am I giving it 4 stars rather than 5? Their internet is a bit spotty. It's frustrating trying to work when I have to reset my connectivity every 5-10 minutes. If they fix this (which shouldn't be difficult), they earn 5 stars."}
{"text":"It is a pretty good little local coffee shop.  They have some nice vegan and gluten free pastries and food.  Wish there were more items to choose from in the case. The staff is always really nice and seem to take pride is what they do.  Does have some whack hours - not open late which is too bad.  Also the Starbucks close by is a bummer"}
{"text":"The coffee was great, the atmosphere relaxed, the staff all very helpful and friendly.  The pear and almond scone was truly amazing.  Crisp where it should be and soft inside. A true delight. I like the fact that it was light and sunny  inside; too much here feels dark. I know, the sun etc but it can be gloomy."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed coffee and iced tea here before. Excellent service and chill atmosphere. I like their patio facing 7th street. Very cozy and comfortable. Hope to be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Is it me or is this place downright filthy? Don't get me wrong the burritos are amazing and the coffee is average, but the place is dirty. If you ever get the chance just look around. I noticed dirty dishes, floors, air vents, and dirty appliances. I leaned against the countertop at the bar and my elbows were greeted by a sticky substance. In the pastry windows, there were crumbs and leftover pastries just sitting there. Will not be going again."}
{"text":"After a very early 6 am flight into Phoenix, I was exhausted and starving.  I couldn't check into my hotel until 3, so I had lots of time to waste.  Being a new-ish vegan, I opened up the Happy Cow app on my phone and saw Urban Beans. Perfect! First off, I work for Starbucks, and I passed by at least 2 Starbucks to come to Urban Beans.  And I'm not disappointed.  I chose the GF banana oat walnut muffin and an iced hibiscus tea.  The muffin is delicious, the tea is exactly what I needed, and I am grateful for the free WiFi. Man, I wish we had a cafe like this back home.  I'd apply to work here and I'd come here every day."}
{"text":"I've been going here for awhile now but felt compelled to review it right now because I am, as I am typing this, enjoying a fresh rasberry-peach scone that is still warm.  (Go in when they first open to get them fresh out of the oven) This place has the most exciting assortment of baked goods compared to other coffee shops that only offer sad, overcooked cookies, stale scones, etc.,  Their scones are baked in the store and they have awesome flavors using different combinations of fresh fruit.  The iced coffee is really nice too. It is really smooth and not too bitter."}
