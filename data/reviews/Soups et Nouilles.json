{"text":"A run of the mill Chinese food - so the USP is price and quantity! yes this is the best bargain in the neighborhood. The house special is the fly -lice (pun here) the fried rice comes mixed with pork, shrimp, chicken and egg and the quantity is huge..I dare myself to finish this in one-sitting and I always loose.

The plus side is the menu here offers a good variety of dishes - in fact, I can easily spend at least 5-6mins deciding what to order
Heres my vote on things

a. Shrimp with Tofu and Pork sauce (very tasty - by good I mean tasty)
b. Fried fish with broccoli (nice but not a very good companion with rice)
c. Kung Pao chicken (not my style - won't have it again)
d. Phad Thai (in between passable - good)
e. Deep fried dumplings (good)

Service is cold - I usually prefer to take out. 
Price includes tax (not sure if that has changed recently). 
Decor is not worth mentioning.
No Wifi"}
{"text":"Other than the duck and the fried rice I wouldn't get anything else here. Truly. The pad thai is a joke!!!"}
{"text":"First off if you don't know the Rules to this place then yeah your going to get bland food and horrible service . I've been eating here since 1995 and im still alive.. but let me just put it out here this place rocks like a bon jovi concert in China , Id even eat the menu but Vue (the cook) won't do it.Now for the rules to this place,1: when you walk just act like you know everybody remember to smile and tell them that their restaurant has saved your life ..2 Always request the back table on the right hand side of the restaurant that gives you full panoramic view  of the entire place this will let them think that you are part of Chinese gangs and need the good view of the entrance .. 3 now if you go in after 9 and bring the cook a cold beer from across the street Heineken beer is his choice, you'll receive a special treat that isn't on the menu just give him the wink and the double nod  . As for the size of the plates you could feed a family of 4 and still have left overs on 3 plates and you won't feel kamikaze at the cash. In conclusion if you haven't had the spaghetti Fujiyama then you haven't eaten here yet.."}

Authentic? No.
Tasty? No.
MSG-drenched? Probably.
Cheap? Yes.
Portions? Large.
Rats and bugs? Infested.

I don't know how people can simply turn a blind eye to the fact that this place is a dump, and cooking within a dump is not healthy nor enjoyable at all, for any price whatsoever. The last time I stepped foot in here was when I saw a rat with my own two eyes running around the kitchen. I stormed out of the restaurant, and if I had known better, I would've called Health Services to take care of it. 

Some people have written how this place is so tasty, despite all that is wrong with it, but why is it so tasty? Because it's drenched in MSG? Because it's drenched in garlic dressings and whatever sauces to confuse your taste buds from realizing you're eating something horrible? 

Everything served here is low grade, deep fried, and over-sauced, let alone cooked amongst insects and rats. If someone paid me a million dollars I wouldn't eat here again. 

To those of you who can, I feel bad for your palate."}
{"text":"DO NOT get the wanton soup or anything wanton for that matter. One order of wanton soup comes with 4 pieces of wanton. Each wanton was 98% wrapper 2% meat. Total rip off!! Worst wanton in my life!"}
{"text":"One of my regular spots

I probably visit more than I should simply because the food at the price it cost is very hard to beat.

Me and my buddy always order either the orange beef or general tao chicken with either chicken fried rice(with orange beef) or the yung chau( I think that's how it's spelled) rice. It's quite hard to tell the difference between the beef and the chicken from the outside appearance but the beef has a tougher texture when you start chewing it as opposed to the chicken. The yung chau rice has a nice combination of carrots, chopped omelet pieces, shrimp, ham and green peas so it looks very colorful and the rice itself has a yellow hue to it, though it could be the lighting(I tend to go there at night). I haven't gotten around to experimenting with other items on the menu simply because I've been hooked on the 4 or so items me and my friend selected.

The place itself is pretty...pretty bad. The dine-in section is pretty small, but I like that they give you a pitcher of water and you are free to serve yourself as opposed to having to wait on the waiter/ress having to bring you water. Other wise it's what you would expect a busy chinese dive/restaurant would be."}
{"text":"Wicked hot and sour soup and general tao chicken. Nobody cares about the ambiance and atmosphere of places like this. Don't waste my time, reviews of places like this are strictly about the food. Of course this place is a dive, it's down right dirty but who cares! The food is great and they've been serving it up for 30 years."}
{"text":"A very pleasant late-night surprise! Stopped in after touring a few brewpubs and finding the food options lacking.

HUGE menu that runs the gamut from Vietnamese to Cantonese Chinese. I had a super-flavorful WonTon soup. For a clear broth, it sure packs a flavor punch! Followed that up with the House Special Fried Rice. I gigantic mound of rice, loaded with chicken, beef, shrimp, and vegetables arrived quickly. A tasty and filling meal! Many other things on the menu looked excellent.

As with others in Montreal, this place is cash-only. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have to be honest the two only Chinese dishes I eat are the General Tao Chicken and -Soupes et Nouilles house special- fried rice and they are both excellent in this restaurant. I must say that I have tried the above-mentioned dishes in a lot of Chinese restaurants and so far this is simply the tastier and best in portion/price ratio (about $16) for two people."}
{"text":"Really good hole-in-the-wall type Chinese-Cantonese joint. It's good, cheap, fast. There's often a lineup all the way down the street during lunch hour. I know I used to live across the street."}
{"text":"Horribly bland food. We ordered 5 items. Only 4 came, even after 2 assurances that the missing item was coming.  It was a blessing in disguise. 1 was mediocre at best and the others were disgusting. We haven't left food on the table in years but we left 80% of the food uneaten and went somewhere else. I have never rated a place only one star but this place has no redeeming quality at all."}
{"text":"Have you ever had pad thai that tasted like it was made with curry? This is what I experienced during a recent visit. Like several other asian restaurants on Sainte Catherine Rue, Soupes et Nouilles markets itself as a cornucopia of various asian cuisines--namely, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, and Japanese (sushi only).  As in most cases, this sort of encompassing menu on paper makes for a disappointing fare in person---the economics rule of specialization should be applied here--- that is, if you attempt to do well, choose one thing and work on it. The aforementioned pad thai, overall , didn't taste awful--but when one orders pad thai, it should taste more or less like pad thai (i.e., a bit of fish sauce, lime, sugar, peanuts). Perhaps the cooks thought I meant to order Singaporean noodles (Chinese) which was also on the menu--highly doubtful since the noodles were definitely pad thai and not sticks.  To their credit, however, the dish was very generous with the shrimp. In addition, we ordered the peanut butter chicken (the sweetness of the peanut butter was reminiscent of mayo shrimp w/walnuts, a favorite dish of mine) which was tasty but a bit heavy on the sauce. We also ordered the calamari which was standard--thankfully.
Overview:
Service = Good, served immediately, nice wait staff
Price = Cheap
Recommendation: Go here for a quick cheap eats if you're not too picky"}
{"text":"What a freaking dive... the place is as basic as you can get and I think that's what adds to its charm. Horrid decor, cold service and very yummy yummy food. And by no means did I say authentic Chinese food or healthy, but just damn tasty goodness to enjoyable to pass up. 

The fried Spring Rolls were oily but so tasty I can't even understand why since they were vegetarian. The little dipping sauce was awesome.

The Dumplings in Spicy Peanut sauce were awesome. If only for the fact that the sauce did not taste like they melted down a jar of Skippy. 

Crispy sesame chicken... HEAVEN. Crunchy, tangy and had this fruity punch to it I can't put my finger on but sealed the deal.

This place has suddenly become my new pit-stop for Chinese on Ste-Catherine's. It's a dump, but in a good way. Awesome."}
