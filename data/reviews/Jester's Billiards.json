{"text":"I went on a Friday night and had a good time! The staff took a while to get me my beer every time but it happens. A lot of younger attractive people which was nice! The music was awful though. They played a country song, followed by some pop song, followed by a screamo song, and then stopped playing music for a solid ten minutes. Other than the slow service and poor music I had a great experience and plan to go back!"}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday. Bought a hat that gives me free pool on Sundays now. I had a blast. Tables are good. Atmosphere is very chill. A very good pool hall. Love their specials..."}
{"text":"I've been to this pool hall many times. Its not just one of the best pool halls around its one of the best places around the SE valley to hang out. The staff is friendly, they always have specials going and the food from the pizza place next door is good too. Its also a great place to go in and watch a game on their HD tv's between a game of pool or darts. I can't wait to get back to AZ after my summer trip and stop in again to visit my friends and grab a cold one."}
{"text":"If anybody wants good service, i recomend main billairds. You dont have  to pay for every song you listen to at least."}
{"text":"Such a blast! The staff is super! Lots of pool tables, along with darts and some old school video games! I loved that we could get food from Rino D's right next store!
I also love the fact that they stay open late."}
{"text":"If i could give this no stars i would. Very rude. I had a mt dew that was in a glass bottle and was drinking it in my car beforw me and my friends went in bevause most places wont let you bring in your drinks. The owner came out and rudely told us to leave. I understand if it was alcohol and all that but he didnt even ask or make sure it was. All o had was mt dew!!!! Like seriously. Save your time and dont go! Very rude!"}
{"text":"It is your neighborhood billiards place. You can get pizaa next door and bring it over. Its a dive for people who listen to nickelback but fun."}
{"text":"Great pool hall they have a smoking room as well. They have darts, quarter tables, and games. I only gave it four because they play the weirdest music there, it trips me out lol"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 8 years never had issues before. Always had great customer service. Past 4 times i've come have been completely ignored by a certain waitress named krissi. She never walked to our table, asked if we needed anything, and passed candies to literally every other table but ours. All other waitresses and bar men have always been good to me, courteous and checked up constantly. One employee can make or break a business. I've managed, been in sales and customer service for 10 years and can honestly say experiences such as this can push the greatest, most loyal customers away."}
{"text":"I have be an on and off customer to this establishment since it was Lazy Q ~10 years ago and a regular for the last two years. (3-4 times a month).Typically my bar tab is between 70 and 150 dollars every time I go.  Recently the owner has decided to remove all music selections on the Touchtones music Jukebox that is classified as metal including Korn,Godsmack,Deftones,Mudvayne,Statix-X,Slipknot, and Lamb of God. I feel very alienated as this is my genre that I like to listen to. I understand that some bad apples have caused this to happen, but no one likes when a few ruin it for everyone. 

A solution to the problem would be instead of bulk removal, remove songs abused, or skip songs that are abused.

I do not want this review to reflect poorly on the staff or the establishment. I love the staff and establishment except for this recent decision that has completely ruined my experience for one of my favorite hangouts. I hope the owner realizes his decision was rash and will lead to an exodus of customers if he retains his current methodology of thinking."}
{"text":"really really great beer selection! believe it or not this might be the secret spot for beer snobs. really knowledgeable bartender too"}
{"text":"Not getting a table after waiting about an hour and a half is frustrating, especially when you're on a list and they don't come get you but they deliver balls to everyone else. Very unprofessional. 15 minutes for drinks is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I would like to say thank you to the owner of Jester's Billiards mr. Darrell we appreciate you apologizing and taking action in your atmosphere we have come back one time since then and I would like to say that it was during the day and a young male was serving us he was also a great bartender that we are a big fan of and we'd like to thank you for continuing to Surprise us. we will be coming back more often now that we know that the problem server is no longer there"}
{"text":"No need to waste time going here. Just drive to different place avoiding the rude staff guy. Seemed like a good idea to go to this place. 
I attended this place for my birthday . I had been at this place and I had an incident were I was charged for another tables drink. I told the guy we hadn't ordered any drinks. which he confirmed with his server. She was good about asking us if we wanted drinks. she told the guy it was her mistake and it was fixed . I go a second time and with my previous experience I checked the bill. I found a mistake again an extra beer that hadn't been ordered. I mentioned to the guy about this had  being the second time I had an incident . he tells me (maybe I shouldn't go there as a reply). I have shared my experience with you to avoid you a headache."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight with a friend, and let me tell you Heather is AMAZING!!! Fantastic service and excellent hospitality. She really made my friend and I feel like we were back home in NY.  Food was good and $3 local beers on Wednesday what a steal!!. Overall great night, great server! Would highly recommend for a good time."}
{"text":"Pretty great for a dive bar.  Dig the atmosphere,  and great prices on drinks.  Good pool prices. Depending on the night the clientele can be a bit dicey though.  Still a great place to go with a group for some good fun."}
{"text":"Went for the first time Saturday night. Nice hidden gem. Great service, solid beer selection, fun vibe, and of course pool."}
{"text":"Visiting the family in Gilbert, da momma, baby brother and I came here to shoot a little pool.  By \"da momma\", I'm actually talking about my mother.  And by \"baby brother\", I'm actually referring to my younger brother.

I love pool by the hour, and at $8 per hour, the rate was good.  They serve typical pizza/wings/cheesesticks-type food, as well as drinks.  I had Heineken and it was cold and tasty.  Waitresses were attentive and friendly.

My moms surprised me; she's quite the shark.  And baby bro didn't do so bad himself.  We spent a good two hours in there, between 7:30 and 9:30 on a Saturday night, and had a good time.

It's 18 and up, so there are some young'uns in there, as well as people who are old enough to drink.  There were also a lot of couples there; it seems like quite the date-place.

All in all, if you're with family-style mixed company like I was, it's a fun spot to visit."}
{"text":"I'm really tired of coming here for the pool tables, beer and atmosphere... and being disappointed by the service...  I can stand at the bar, make eye contact and wait patiently while no other customer is waiting.. and be ignored for 10 straight minutes. Then, my order is finally taken and another task is done by the staff first, another order is taken right next to me, and their drinks are finished before mine is even started. I'm baffled. It's happened every single time I go here, so about 8 times over the last 6 months. There have been other instances where the staff has made comments, with attitude, and intention of being forwardly rude... I'm giving 2 starts for the prices and the pool tables and that is it.   Staff is 100% horrible. I give people the benefit of the doubt, everyone has bad days but obviously this is a regular occurrence. I'm a kind, patient person and I have no idea how I've received such poor service. I've worked in the service industry for quite a while and can't believe this place. It really sucks because it has great potential."}
{"text":"First time coming back here in almost 4 years (then known as Lazy Q), and it was a vast improvement over the previous time. Great pricing on tables ($15 for the night after 6:00), and a phenomenal craft beer menu. Service was great, atmosphere is your general bar atmosphere, but if you're with a group of people, it makes for a great time. Very low key, hole in the wall type of place. Definitely my new regular hangout spot."}
{"text":"Good, solid pool hall.  Nice staff and generally good tables, recommended!"}
{"text":"They have an inside smoking room in AZ!!!!!!! I love this place. The bartender was very nice. I had a great time, only bad things is the heavy plastic you have to go through to get in to the smoking room is a pain when you're carrying a rack of balls and drinks and the floors could use some cleaning. Plus when you're in there, even though there is a walk through for the bar staff, they never popped over to see if anyone needed anything. Other than that it's a great place"}
{"text":"Went to jesters to play pool was told I couldn't come in because I was wearing a Jersey apparently no sleeveless shirts after 8 pm it wasn't like I was wearing a under shirt and how the heck is it OK before 8 pm but magically not after 8 BS"}
{"text":"It was nice they had a smoking and non-smoking section, but like others have said, it has a lot of teeny-boppers, not quite my scene, but I guess to each their own. Waitress was attentive, but they take your beer (no exceptions) at 2am when they close. Price to play was alright, but their 'sex on the beach' got me sick that night...maybe it wil be better the next time I go."}
{"text":"I was looking for a local billard place so my wife and I could shoot around a bit, and I found this place. Good prices and great service. 
Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"When I stumbled into this pool hall the first thing I noticed was the music...... the terrible scream at the top of your lungs over banging drums and guitars type of music!! If I had been driving myself, I would have turns around and found something more my speed! That being said.  Service was good, we always had beer and didn't have to wait long.  Tables are a little rough but playable."}
{"text":"I think the beer selection is wonderful there with I think it was around 70 different kinds. I know that leagues are in there so if you want to join a pool league this might be the place for you. There is a Diamond table in there and some action too."}
{"text":"Good time...
Chill environment...
Just finding new ways to entertain myself..

Shooting pool and throwing darts is always good clean fun...

If I'm ever I'm the area with friends I'll def come back...
Maybe...
Lol

Plenty of tables so no wait and the price was good..."}
{"text":"Five stars for the Employees one star for the owner. I'm not a regular but I have been going there occasionally since 1996 when it was the Lazy Q. The beer selection is great but I would steer clear if you enjoy music that would be considered extreme. The jukebox had tons of \"clean\" music on it and had many bands excluded from the data base. Really? I applaud the owner for editing music he doesn't like. His excuse was people left the pool hall because patrons would play \"Death metal or Gansta Rap \" incessantly. It's a bar, not a family resturant. It's too bad the owner is regulating morality like our Government. I vote with my dollars. I'll be going elsewhere for some beers after work. It's too bad because his great employees are losing tips and the owner looses the cut he gets on the jukebox."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! I've been going to that location since it was Lazy Q's pool hall but haven't been back in a long time. I'm sure glad I went! 

We went on a Saturday night at 8 p.m., what is usually one of the busiest hours for any establishment. Despite the hour, we were given a table immediately and our waitress came by many times that we lacked any need. I think she might have been flirting with my friend too haha.

The place is split into 2 sections - the large room with endless tables and another smaller room designated for smoking. I have no idea how they got through the loophole with the smoking ban but I'm sure smokers appreciate it. I was in the non smoking room but I didn't smell any smoke emanating from the other room. There are hourly and quarter tables and prices weren't too bad either. For the busy time we went, we paid $10/hour. Weekdays are cheaper of course. Tables are very clean and we didn't have any problem with ours. Sometimes you can get a table that leans or is bumpy but not here. The cues were all decent too. On our first try we got a balanced cue with good weight. They had couple different weight cues. 

Now the ever important bar - what is it about pool halls and alcohol that makes them so great together? They have a great bar selection. They had around a dozen beers on tap and a good selection of bottles as well. They had drink specials, which is rare for a Saturday night, and we definitely took advantage of that. For Saturday, only thing I can tell you is that from 7 p.m. - 9 p.m., it was $3 off pitchers and from 7 p.m. to closing, they had $2 kamikazes. We had a few kamikazes, 2 pitchers and a bottle and the total was around $30. Sorry, I can't give you definite price as I didn't look at the itemized receipt. But for all that, it wasn't bad at all. And it wasn't just all American ale on tap either. We had Blue Moon and O'dell's cutthroat porter but they definitely had a good variety, including couple from San Tan brewery. 

Another plus for the place - Groupon! I was able to find a Groupon Now! deal for them, a $10 for $20 deal. My husband couldn't find it for some reason but I found it on my phone and was able to use it that night without any problem. 

Being a pool hall, I was a bit concerned that maybe it would be too loud but not at all. Even on a busy night, I had no problem conversing with the boys and we didn't have to scream in each other's faces. Huge plus there. I hate when they have to shout and spit in your face. =)

All in all, I'll definitely be back. My husband needs to work on his game a bit more haha."}
{"text":"Before I  left a pretty harsh review. I try to be fair so here it is. While I pointed out the poor selection on tap, I wasn't aware they are limited on space etc...the owner Mr. Chester, responded to my previous review. That goes a long way with me. I have ran businesses in the past and unfortunately at times your hands are tied. To be fair, I didnt take this into account. Due to the response and more understanding of the owners efforts and care, I will be back. I support my locals. God Bless. 

P.S. An owner who responds with respect not a dagger goes a long way. Thank you."}
{"text":"Snakebites! one of the best! more then hundred types of beer-plus a 5 star  billboard. good service and good prices."}
{"text":"My family and I often go here to play on Jester's quality tables and enjoy their competitive prices and friendly staff. 

Jester's has an awesome selection of beers and their partnership with a neighboring Italian restaurant is a genius business model. 

I come with my family (women except for me) and enjoy their lady's night special (only I have to pay.) This makes for a cheap and fun family night. 

This is not a perfect rating for two reasons: 
1) There have been a few occasions when we have shown up ready to play but all the tables are booked for leagues and tournaments. This is a good thing for Jester's but a bad thing for recreational players. I cannot think of a fix except to purchase more square footage and add more tables. Maybe get rid of the plastic tip dart section since I never see people use those. 

2) I have witnessed one occurance (but other customers have told me this is common) where the opening shift is late to open the doors for business. I waited and hour for her to arrive and let us in."}
{"text":"I couldn't get beyond the front door as the stench of stale cigarette smoke instantly brought on an asthma attack.  Dated and dirty are the 2 words that describe this place.  Well worth the extra miles to go down to Skip and Jans on Warner and McQueen."}
{"text":"Why 4 stars?  One of the few really good Foosball table's in town.  As a once avid Foosball player  I know how hard they are to come buy. Was actually playing in a league there for a while, so I know their food is good (they actually order from the place next door and bring it over, so they have great Garlic bread). the pool tables are good, dart boards good, and things are not too crowded."}
{"text":"I think this place is great, came here with my fiancé  to relax and play some pool and drink. I was pretty amazed how affordable their drinks are here. I highly recommend this place if your looking for a low key night and just want to play some pool with your buddies and drink some cheap beers."}
{"text":"I usually love jesters because of their awesome beer selection, pool tables, and megatouch. I did used to come in because they had pretty good customer service too. Recently I moved and haven't been by in awhile, but today after work I was really craving a good craft beer and some megatouch. I walked in and the bar top was half full so I decided to grab a beer and go to the smoking side (even though I don't smoke) to play a few games because after standing there for a few minutes non of the employees even acknowledged I was standing there. One of their trashy bartenders was too busy shouting and cussing at some regular about how she was trying to get off work soon. I sat on the smoking side for 25 minutes playing some games as two different bartenders walked in and out helping other people. I tried making eye contact to try and get a beer but that didn't help. I finally left when the bartender trying to get off her shift cashed out the guy sitting next to me and still did not acknowledge that I was there. Some of the worst service I've had...almost as bad as the service from Simpletons, (every once in awhile you can get a beer there if the bartender isn't too strung out on heroine) but this was only my first or second bad experience I've had at jesters so I won't actually say as a whole they are that bad. I could throw my empty beer glass on any given day at the bartender at simpletons and they still wouldn't know I finished my beer... so hopefully today was a fluke and maybe next time I will be able to get one of their delicious beers after a long day of work."}
{"text":"Would've have definitely given this place five stars if the owner wasn't so rude,but there waitresses are always friendly and nice,there drink prices are unbeatable and rino D's is next door for bomb grub,"}
{"text":"Lacy and Ashley are the funniest bartenders I've met in Arizona. The commeraderie between the whole staff is unbelievable. I asked them if it's just a facade and they talk a bunch of shit behind each other's backs... nope, they really get along. I had to come back the next night and they remembered my name and what I want to drink  I love them so much!! I don't want to leave tomorrow. 

Oh, and they have pool."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Saturday of last week. The bartender was very friendly and welcoming. There were plenty of pool tables and the prices were reasonable. I had a very good experience shooting pool here, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stood around waiting for the bar tender to ask us what we wanted. Wait staff was scrambling around complaining that the coke machine was out. One girl asked us what we wanted and proceeded to say \"We 13 beers on tap, or was it 20? No 27??\" And then walked away without getting us anything. Finally when I asked why 5 staff members were all standing around and we couldn't get any service they smarted off to me and we left. Don't go here, their manners are as about as stale as the cigarette stench that clings to the walls."}
{"text":"Perfect little pool hall.. plenty of 9' and bar tables. Came here with my brother to get some game time in and it was perfect.  A huge selection of bet on tap,  bottle or cans.  Decent music... separate smoking section completely separated with tables as well for those who want to smoke and play. The smoke smell didn't really carry over to the non smoking.. it's basically in a different storefront with its own ventilation system. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place weekly ever since I heard about it. They have an amazing selection of beers for craft beer lovers, anywhere from bottles of The Duchess de Bourgogne to rotating Dogfish Head drafts. The food is from the pizza joint next door and they're wings are to die for (I am really picky with my wings).  The spiciest ones are extremely spicy and saucy, which I love!  Now to the pool tables.  They have mainly 9-footers and a ton of them.  The tables are a little beat up as this place has been around for a while, but they frequently re-felt them so they are better than most other pools halls. For those that aren't used to playing on big tables, they have about 12 7-footers. The rates for playing are great, only $20 for unlimited play on the weekend and $16 during the week, in addition to the daily specials they have.  If you want to catch a sports match, there are plenty of decent-sized TVs all around.  Overall a great place to go if you like good beer and pool."}
{"text":"This is a great place to play pool and darts. Not too loud, not rowdy, plenty of room to move around. Our favorite neighborhood pool joint by far!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My sister and one our best friends and I go, often now, and will continue to go. Great staff, great beer and of course you get to play pool while listening to a very random variety of music. It's for sure a fun place to go have a chill night."}
{"text":"I love Jesters, it's a giant pool hall with an indoor smoking room. As a smoker this is something I love but I would warn nonsmokers that it can get a bit musky in the main pool hall. They also allow vape pens, which people take massive advantage of. 

They offer many pool tables, ranging from 7 foot to 9 foot and both electric and classic dart boards. They have a punching bag, a few arcade games, pinball, and foosball. Along with many tables to sit at though they could feel a bit cramped if you're with a large group. 

They offer food until 11pm most nights, provided by the pizza place next door which is very good. They have a large drink selection and a full bar. And even offer different deals depending on the day. 

They have a pool and dart league almost every night of the week (Monday through Thursday) and after 18 weeks you get to pick at a que from Viking or Mcdermont (two very good brands) that you can customize. 

Tuesday night is ladies night so tables are free, its also half off ciders and wheat beers until 11pm so its a great way to celebrate ladies night. And theres a jukebox full of different music to jam to. 

Plenty of parking and great for large groups, I would (and do) suggest Jesters to anyone who likes pool. You can even win a few bucks playing the sharks on the quarter tables (though good luck!)

The only reason they dont have five stars is that the service can be a bit spotty. Sometimes its great and feels like every 15 minutes you're being asked if you want anything, other times you'll see the waitress once in 2 hours. Has nothing to do with how busy the bar is or whats going on at the time, just depends on who is working that day."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pool hall. They have tons of different tables to choose from. Prices to play by the hour are very reasonable. I believe that they have a separate 21 and up smoking room and after 10PM the main room turns into 18 and up, which is refreshing! They do card so make sure to bring your ID or you will not get in! Great selection of beer and wines, however somethings could use a little updating, and possibly some additional  seating. This place is nothing fancy but overall a great place to go hang out with friends on a Friday or Saturday night!"}
{"text":"I went to Jester's with Bae and a good friend for some 9-ball practice.  There are a ton of tables and we were able to get one right away on a Saturday night in the non-smoking area (which is more than fine by me).  The biggest disappointment was the table types.  We play our league on a bar table, but at Jester's the bar tables are all pay-as-you-go $0.75 tables.  We wanted the hourly rates, so we were stuck at a large table.  Honestly, I had no idea the tables came in different sizes, since I started out on the bar tables in NYC.  There is a huge difference.  We started with a pitcher of Dos Equis, but it tasted a little flat, so we switched to bottles and mead.  Apparently, there's a local mead company that is just hitting the scene.  It was reasonably priced for being mead, but tasted like cider.  They have more flavors coming, including a prickly pear so I will definitely be keeping an eye on their menu.  There is no food, but they allow patrons to order from next door and they actually go get it for you.  No menus though...  We probably would have ordered a snack if we knew what they had.  Maybe you have to ask for them?"}
{"text":"I already like this place! Over 10 year pool player. So I can spot great pool places! My new home!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place per se  but I had to cut my visit short due to the excessive smoke in the \"non-smoking\" room. Either the filters are dirty and not doing their job or they're working in reverse and actually bringing the smoke into the room. Service was good. The gentleman at the counter gave us a coupon some free pool but honestly, i dont think I can go back until I know the air is going to be breathable. Shame since this is the closest pool hall this side of the Rio grande besides downtown Mesa. Hopefully I can get this smoke smell off of my clothes."}
{"text":"Awesome pool hall!

The manfriend and I made the treck to check out the pool hall a friend of ours suggested. It was a great idea! Tons of pool tables, many different sizes as well. You can rent them hourly and there are some quarter tables as well. The neatest thing that I haven't seen in a while is they have a smoking room. Its not a patio, its an actual room, with pool tables and a bar, and you can smoke inside. This is not my cup of tea per say, but I know it is a huge plus for a lot of people. 

I also noticed they only serve beer and wine.... however, if you get a look at their beer menu you wont miss the liquor one bit. Some of my faves are the numerous DogFishHead beers they have, they had the PUNK (pumpkin ale) on draft the last time were in, yum! 

They have a great juke box as well..... TIP for iPhone users*** download the My Touch Tunes app on your phone and you can play music right from your phone on the bars juke box and you wont have to walk across the bar to hear your jams. Awesome!

They do not serve food in the bar, HOWEVER they ahve a deal with the Italian place next door, pizza pasta salad sammys, that you can order from your server and they will deliver to the bar when its ready. You can bring other food into the bar from any of the other places around there too, so no biggie on that end. 

Happy pooling!"}
{"text":"I am no pool expert by any stretch, but I really love coming to this place.  The staff is very low turnover and super friendly, and it is an inexpensive, low-key date.  The crowd is comprised of a whole variety of people, so no matter who you are you'll fit in.

If you are looking for something to do \"late night\" on the east side that is not a movie, it can be tricky to find something.  This is a great option for a group of friends, a couple, a couple of couples (ha!), and I have a buddy that even goes alone.

There is someone owner/manager-ish who recognizes people (us) and takes time to acknowledge you, make sure you're happy, etc."}
{"text":"So I brought my kids to a pool hall... and they were welcome. None of us are what you would call pool sharks, but we really enjoy hanging out together and playing a few games. I was so pleased that Jesters offered family hours. Before 7 you can bring the kids. There were a few other children there with their families and was nice to see them getting to spend time together. Most of the tables were taken when we arrived but the area did not feel crowded at all. We got a great table at the end of the middle row and plenary of space to play. You can order food from the pizza joint next door and the waitresses at Jesters will bring it to you. The pizza was pretty good and the wings were great huge plus it was well priced as well. If they would do pitchers of soda that would make the deal perfect. I am sure we will be spending more afternoons there."}
{"text":"So I am new in Mesa, making Mesa my home, I play pool, went into Jesters, meet Lacy the bartender, she was fabulous, outgoing and personable and very warm and friendly, came back at 9 and Roger was the bartender, and he was unfriendly and boring..and not helpful at all, the patrons were rude and unsociable,  I just wanted to play pool and some arrogant old piece of crap who I approached to play pool said no, we gambling, not here to pick up chicks, let me tell homeboy the last chick you picked up on was your mom while sucking on her chi chi 's.  Very sad that this establishment welcomes new clientele and travelers this way...poor establishment"}
{"text":"The tables are always clean. Freindly staff. Straight pool cues. The food is really decent. Great selection of beer. What else can I say? Its my go to place for billiards. But they have other games. Darts and things. They also have a seperate room for you smokers."}
{"text":"Great service and very attentive staff. There are several pool tables and a really wide variety of beer and ciders to choose from. Pretty much a guaranteed good time!"}
{"text":"This place is so much fun!!! My boyfriend and I really like to play pool and this has been the best place we've been to in town :) 
The food is very good as well, I recommend the chicken strips."}
{"text":"So I'll start by saying that the only reason this place gets a one star deduction is because they don't serve food, they do allow outside food to be brought in though; so this is a game changer but not a complete buzzkill. That being said, I don't drink anything harder than soda so I can't speak to the bartending. The reason I will call this my defacto hangout is because I'm a dart player and this place has the largest array of boards that I've seen outside of Central Phoenix!!! They have both steel & soft tip boards; and enough of both so that I'm not displaced when league play is taking place. Top notch Billiards Hall!!"}
{"text":"Wow! What can I say about this place. The customer service is excellent. The pool tables are excellent. The vibe is laid back and low key. They have pool leagues through the week which give you an opportunity to meet new people. While you are playing pool, the music is excellent. It makes you want to dance without it being too loud. Really fun place, accommodating staff, and good tables = a good time."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out. Cheap play and great staff. The only thing I'm sad about is the under 21 policy after 11. I understand it, but now I just wish I was 21!"}
{"text":"Just discovered Jester's about six months ago. To be honest I never really bothered stopping in just because it always looked closed. Me and a couple of my friends were bored on a Sunday night and decided to drop in to play some pool. Atmosphere is pretty awesome defiantly not a place where you would want to bring kids. There's a full bar as well as a room strictly, assuming, smokers which is nice. When I with my friends we typically stay with the quarter tables, which can sometimes be frustrating because there's only about 6-8 of those. Great place to go to if you have some time to kill 4 stars just because on a Friday night you can't seem to get a quarter table period."}
