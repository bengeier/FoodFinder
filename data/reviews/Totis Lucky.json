{"text":"I live nearby and after reading the one review I had to try it for myself. I've always been the kind of person that figures things out for themselves rather than listening to others. 
Anticipating the worst, it was actually pretty good. The burritos I got were nice portion and I didn't wait... or wait... or wait. 
Margaritas were hooked up but not overpowering (which was nice!). I can see how the menu looked a little thrown together, but at the same time I've been to much worse. 
They could also use a new sign to attract people, it was a little hard to find. We were 1 of 3 groups of people around dinner time, but that might not be the food, just bad marketing skills. 
Overall, the food, the price, the service was worth it. I'd go back. 

I suggest if you have children and want only one taco per child, make sure they understand you. Some people don't always understand everything..."}
{"text":"as much as I want to support Brunswick's businesses I will not go back there. It was freezing cold in there, I mentioned it to the server who said he would ask to turn the heat up, didn't happen. I was charged for three drinks and only had two, the server ignored me when I pointed it out. I waited for them to correct the bill and after 10min. I just paid it and left. This place has an identity problem, is it Mexican or Italian? My husband had eggplant pasta, it was horrible and did not even come with a slice of bread or a salad. I had ground beef enchiladas, they were the driest things I've ever eaten, no sauce. I agree with the one poster, the chips and salsa were the only good thing about the whole experience."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa at this place are the only redeeming quality. We were the only patrons on a Friday night, while the parking lot at the Mexican restaurant down the road was full - a big red flag that we, unfortunately, ignored. Menu appears scattered and unprofessional; too many items (page after page of Bar food, American, Italian, and Mexican food) - pages that appear printed from a home printer and stuck in a binder purchased at Staples. Though we were the only ones in the place, we waited....and waited....and waited....for our dinners. I ordered soft tacos for our three girls (ages 2, 4, and 7). While I thought it would be a no-brainer that I wanted one for each of them, the waitress brought three $10 taco DINNERS for my small children. Complete with a very spicy green sauce in little cups. When I mentioned that I only wanted one taco for each of them, the waitress just ignored me. The children's dinners were complete with scoops of very old, sat around in warming trays too long refried beans, as well as mushy, old flavorless rice. The chef came out shortly after the waitress left to explain that kids eat free on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Yeah - thanks, but I don't think we'll be taking advantage of that any time soon, and anyway, how does that help the obvious communication problem we have NOW?  I ordered the chicken enchiladas. One bite was enough for me. Blech. The chicken was dried out and there were these hard pieces of something mixed in with them - overcooked bacon, perhaps? On top was what appeared to be an all-purpose tomato based sauce. Maybe they use it for both the Mexican and Italian dishes? My husband ordered fajitas. Waitress forgot the tortillas. It was a while before she came back so he could tell her. His 'filling' was a very modest portion of mostly green peppers. He said it was 'okay'. The decor was hard to place. Whatever it was, it was really old, dusty, and faded - perhaps some sort of Tuscan attempt from the previous restaurant? This place needs lots of help."}
