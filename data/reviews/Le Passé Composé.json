{"text":"If I could eat this for brunch everyday. It's got all the flavours and textures I could wish for, puts all the subpar egg bennies to shame"}
{"text":"Not your typical hangover type of brunch place but instead a classy yet homey take-your-grandmother-on-an-outing place to go to. Except it's also approachable to muscular tattoo'd men, foodie students who talk about price value per portion, and mothers with their newborn babies.  Range of food choices depending how hungry you are and what you like for breakfast, from bacon to foie gras, and everything is presented with class and with the cutest shotglass of smoothie and fruit bouquet that the little burrito-eating hamster on YouTube would appreciate.   Expect a half hour wait on weekends - dress warmly! Bring some extra cash if you want to buy a framed photograph/painting off the wall."}
{"text":"Petit resto absolument délicieux! Un peu cher à mon goût, mais ça vaut la peine. Très bon!"}
{"text":"Great service! Our waitress recommended the french toast instead of the pancake. She was so right! Crispy on the outside from the panko breadcrumbs with a fluffy bread on the inside. The food is well flavoured and the portion size is good. Lots of different dishes to choose from. Will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Petit, mais l'attente vaut la peine! Après avoir goûter à plusieurs assiettes lors de trois visites, ma conclusion est que tout y est bon."}
{"text":"Nice place for brunch with nicely composed meals and friendly service. Nice way to spend a weekend brunch date."}
{"text":"As expected,  they use interesting ingredients and food material. Fresh taste and healthy     The Strawberry and rhubarb smoothie is good but very sweet, wondering if sugar is added.   Tried the poached eggs with duck confi and salmon sandwich, both are good. Althoug the fried avocado is a bit disappointing since the flavor of the avocado is somewhat missing.  the portion is big, couldn't finish at the end.  The biggest downside is the waiting time is a bit long for a lunch break.  Would want to try the UF POCHÉ FOIE GRAS next time."}
{"text":"This wonderful neighborhood place specializes in breakfast, but serves lunch as well. The food is served on large Dansk china plates and is probably the most beautiful petit dejeuner presentation I have seen during my nine months living in Montreal. The variety of fresh fruits is amazing. The servers are first rate. About 50 yards west of Parc La Fontaine. Try it; you'll like it."}
{"text":"Great brunch! But not so great service...  I came here yesterday on Sunday at 1 pm with three others. We expected a wait as they don't take reservations. It took about 45 mins for us to be seated.   On the menu, there was a selection of eggs, omelettes, sandwiches, and sweet items, such as crepes, waffles and French toast. All of which come with some fruit and coffee. There was also some specials of the day, including gazpacho. Most items were typically priced for brunch ($15-20).  Okay, bad note first: our dishes came out after an insane wait... over an hour! It seemed like there was only one cook working that day. The waitresses kept refilling our coffees, but never apologized for the delay, almost like it was a normal thing for customers to be waiting that long.   On a good note, the food was awesome. I had the French toast (le pain dore) that was absolutely delicious! The panko made a very crispy crust and the inside was soft and creamy. I've never seen French toast made with panko and now when I eat French toast I'll always compare it to the one I had here. I also tried some of the 'omelette roulée parisienne', which had baked ham, bacon, mushrooms, and cheese, and it was also very good, although a bit on the salty side. As a plus, every dish was nicely presented and filling (and we were starving by the time the food arrived!)."}
{"text":"It took over an hour to get our meal. We told one of the employees and he got angry at us! Told us it had only been 15 minutes. Very rude. They were apologetic afterwards.  As for the food, 3 of 5 were happy. The other two felt the meals were not very flavorful."}
{"text":"Horrible service by the person who takes the names... Told us it would be 45 min wait and after 1 hour he said they would not be able to serve us... And somehow he started giving me attitude because I seemed disappointed raising his voice saying it's not their fault... It's fine, but why the hell are you raising your voice at me in front of others. I was leaving. I used to go regularly, but not after this rude incident."}
{"text":"We live on Montreal and this is one of our favorite breakfast spots. We always recommend our friends and guests go here when in town. Side of French toast, an ABSOLUTE must!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for your first meal of the day! However, the food presentation looks cold and the lineup seemed chaotic... Read more on http://theforbiddenmeal.com/2014/11/05/le-passe-compose-revisiting-the-past-by-brunching-in-the-present/"}
{"text":"Checked out this restaurant while stay in Montreal for my birthday, since it was down the street for my airbnb. This place exceeded my expectations! We went later in the day, around 1:30 - 2 pm and the wait wasn't bad, we waited for about 5 minutes. The food was delicious everything they brought out looked so good. Definitely try the french toast. And to top if off, our waitress Melissa was the best! I would definitely come back when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"This place has become one of my regular brunchery spots for a few reasons: The menu is extensive and unique -- there are items on there that are so tasty and that you won't find anywhere else. Every time I go there's something different that I want to try (shout-out to the weekly specials!), and I get the feeling that I could never get bored eating at this place.  The dishes I've had here tend to feature flavor-packed sauces and/or super-rich meat preparations (e.g., braised pork shoulder, duck confit, foie gras, etc.), which can make for a pretty heavy, intensely savory meal. While I LOVE this (omnomnoms), I could see how these might be characteristics that not everyone appreciates in a brunch. The plates are also huge, so large portions in combination with the richness means that I can never make it through the entire plate and almost always have to take half my meal home with me. (Which is fine by me -- next-day delicious treats are a big BIG win in my book.)  I also appreciate that sometimes when the weather is nice, the host or hostess will take your cell phone number so that you can go down the street to enjoy Parc La Fontaine while you wait for them to call you when your table is ready.  The slight downside is that, due to the nature of the eat-slowly-and-savor dishes and the fact that it's always jammed with people, undertaking brunch at Le Passé Composé can become a marathon event.  So I don't advise trying to go there if you're unprepared to have a leisurely-paced brunching experience that may or may not even include a stroll around the local park."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! We visited on Sunday around 10:30AM and waited on line, the host came around to take names and about 30-45 minutes later we were seated. The wait was totally worth it because the food is incredible. I ordered the foie gras poached eggs and my husband ordered the duck confit poached eggs - both were served with sides of fruit and a shot of strawberry rhubarb smoothie. We split a side of apple doughnuts sprinkled with powdered sugar served with dipping sauces. Everything was absolutely delicious and the service was great. This was our last stop on our Montreal trip and I wish we knew about it sooner because I would have definitely come for brunch more than once."}
{"text":"Excellent food, amazing presentation. Long queue though, wait time can be more efficiently managed."}
{"text":"Le brunch est bon mais malheureusement l accueil de la clientèle et le service et horrible c est vraiment dommage je pense que les personnes du service sont les patronnes car je doute que des employés pourraient se permette de jeter les cartes sur les tables, de débarrasser les assiettes avant même Qu on ai le temps de manger .... Et sa se permet de râler pour les tips quand on laisse 10% .... Vraiment dommage"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch. It looked like a cafe out of Paris (a couple of seats decorating the outside, a gallery wall, the casual taxidermy), very quaint and quirky on the inside. We did have to wait about 15 minutes, but they take your name & number down so you could wander about until they called you. I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict, and my friend ordered a smoked salmon & fried avocado bagel (it looked amazing too!). We also got apple beignets to share. The food was delicious, especially those beignets... still thinking about them! haha. Additionally, the plating was so pretty! The only thing was the wait for our food - it took about 1/2 an hour. They did apologize that their fryer had not been working properly. Other than that, I recommend it as a brunch place to try!"}
{"text":"My little foursome wait about 20 minutes before we're seated and we start quickly with mimosa. Then, the beignets arrive. No one speaks as we savour the apple beignets accompanied by fresh-made yogourt with vanilla bean and an apple caramel sauce. A must!  Everything I have here is decadent. Not only do I ravage my oeuf poché champêtre (except for the pain brioché - because eating it is like trying to fit a couch through a narrow doorway) but I sample my sister's buttery basil bread and omelette roulée végé aux herbes, along with my friends' omelette roulée parisienne (Adolphe's) and panko-crusted French toast (Amalia's). Our waitress, Sarah Jane, explains that the delicious omelettes are first fried and then finished in the oven. The omelettes have a wonderful texture: I will keep day-dreaming of it until I return for my own plate. Everyone is very happy eating.  The service is not as attentive as I'd hoped, but yes, the food will call me back."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal.   Although we waited in line for about 20 minutes on Saturday morning, between 10-10:30, there was self serve coffee outside and it was actually GOOD! Once we got in we were sat at the bar, something I've never done at breakfast before (at least before 11 AM). We were three people and it was a little loud, but we still managed good conversation while catching highlights on the French sports network. I ordered a cappuccino as it seemed like the appropriate thing to do, and it came in a bar glass. A curious choice of cup, however it tasted great and I felt more \"hip\" after consuming it. When I ordered \"LE DEJEUNER DU PASSÉ COMPOSÉ\" and asked for a crepe instead of French toast, the waitress asked me if it was my first time here.  I said yes, and she told me to go with French toast as the restaurant is known for their French toast. She wasn't lying. This breakfast  was fantastic... But the French toast was out of this world! Don't even think twice about getting it. Actually, you may want to think twice... After eating it, you'll likely never enjoy another order of French toast anywhere else. So it's on you if you want to take that risk of ruining the French Toast experience for yourself. I'm not a big French toast guy so I was all in on this.   Despite it being incredibly busy the service was relatively fast, the food was well cooked and well presented. Oh, and you can also get a baguette as a toast option. If this doesn't scream Montreal for a tourist, I don't know what does."}
{"text":"Excellent déjeuner. J ai commandé le classique du passé composé et les oeufs ainsi que les viandes étaient cuits à la perfection. Bravo pour cette généreuse assiette !"}
{"text":"Delicious foie gras eggs benny!!!! The only drawback about the restaurant is definitely the long lines and lack of organization by hostess (at least on that day) where people just hoarded around the entrance and there was no real line of who arrived first and should be next to get a table."}
{"text":"Let's do brunch! Last weekend, I tried passé compose for the first time over brunch with a girlfriend. Hiding in the residential part of plateau, it was not the most accessible spot to get to.  Nonetheless, we finally found it and sat inside the two living room sized resto.    For anglophones out there, the menu is only available in FRENCH ! However, the waitress is pretty helpful so don't hesitate to ask. This cozy little bistro is known for it's Parisienne French toast & egg Benedict, which comes in a number of options including fois gras and pork shoulder. Yum yum. I ordered the regular eggs, ham and potatoes (guilty because of the dinner the night before) and my friend ordered the gaspar Benedict (or so I believe). My dish was alright, but definitely regretted it because my friends Benedict looked AMAZING. She also ordered the hot chocolate which came in a bowl size and according to her, was a total winner.    Only giving it a 3 star because my dish was alright and nothing out of the ordinary. But then it's just eggs and potatoes. Will definitely be returning for the French toast and Benedicts. See you soon, passé compose !"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch place to go! The eggs benedicts are to die for! First time i went, i fell in love. Right now, i start inviting friends over and they sure do love the food. Expect for a long line and it is pricey, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Le Passe Compose is a classic Montreal brunch spot. I got here early on a Saturday morning at around 10:00 am and was seated right away. The design of the restaurant is more of a long bar shape. It is quite cute inside with a bar as well as small tables. I had the deconstructed pancakes which were a deepfried breaded banana on top of a crepe with nutella, coconut and almond. It was served with pineapple around it and had quite the tropical flavour. My friend had one of their omlettes with potato and the portion size was quite large. The brunch here is on the pricier side around $18-22 for most things but they have good strong coffee to keep you buzzed. The service can be slow when it gets a bit busier and by 11am there was quite the line inside the restaurant.   Tip: get here early to avoid the line but they do have free coffee outside to keep you warm."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, once on the deck and the other time inside.  Both environments were calm in the morning and I enjoyed the music selections and the quiet.  The server was attentive and very kind.  I had the panko french toast both times and upon another visit to Montréal in the future, will probably not stray from this selection :)"}
{"text":"C'est absolument  un endroit à découvrir !!! Je l'ai découvert un dimanche matin pour un brunch et c'est de loin dans les meilleurs brunchs de Montréal !! La carte ne fait pas partie des classiques genre 2oeufs, viande, bacon...c'est bien plus élaboré !! Pour ma part je me suis risquée avec l'uf poché, canard effiloché, parmesan, sauce Porto blanc et courge... Ce fut une explosion de saveurs !! Belle présentation, fruits en abondance. Et le petit plus... Ils ont des croissants à remplacer du traditionnel muffin anglais! Cuisine originale et agréable de découverte! Laissez vous guider par les petits curs sur les côtes ! Petits points moins cool, c'est qu'il ne faut pas être trop pressé... Plats non classiques donc plus long a faire que 2 ufs au plat et bacon ... Mais l'attente vaut le coût ! Puis ils vous offrent un petit café à l'extérieur pour l'attente !! Point positif comparé à d'autres places à brunchs ! Puis pour le prix ont est loin des 10-12$... Comme de plus en plus d'endroit d'ailleurs... C'est entre 15-20$ le plat, mais largement justifié pour ce qui a dans l'assiette !!! Bref je vous recommande fortement !!!"}
{"text":"Good food, long wait but were offered apple donuts so overall very happy"}
{"text":"Definitely a must for brunch. Absolutely loved the food and ambiance. Planning on making another trip soon. I don't eat pork and wasn't to keen on the duck confit so the waiter kindly suggested replacing the meat with more mushrooms. What can I say, it was simply delicious and did not miss the meat at all! Me and my friends shared the Panko french toast and absolutely lovde it. We went on a monday around 12 and came right before the rush started. The staff was friendly and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Definitely recommend to anyone who is in the area. It is more expensive than other breakfast/brunch restaurants, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Brunch très bon, un de mes préférés à Montréal! Que ce soit des plats sucrés ou salés, les plats sont tous copieux et originaux.. Si vous en avez marre des brunchs classiques, le passé composé est définitivement une place à découvrir! L'été la terrasse est très agréable. Par contre c'est très achalandé, y aller tôt ou alors prendre son mal en patience ... Les prix sont corrects pour des plats orignaux, entre 15$ et 20$ le plat."}
{"text":"The food was beautifully presented, but the service was quite slow. It was packed inside so we jumped at taking the table outside, which was great as there is no A/C inside. The menu has great variety and everything sounded delicious. Lovely place for brunch  Food: 4/5 Service: 2/5 Location: 3/5"}
{"text":"Great brunch place. They are in the higher of brunch in montreal. The food quality reflect it."}
{"text":"Can't beat the fois gras eggs Benedict they serve here!!!!  Soooo yummy - presentation was excellent, everything was so pretty and delicate!  And the taste did not disappoint!  A good portion of fois gras on buttery French toast, with mixed fruits and a mini strawberry shake on the side!  Latte was rich and flavourful also!  Ambiance and decor of the place is great - the perfect brunch spot! :)"}
{"text":"Such amazing food.  There is a bit of a wait but so worth it!!  Every bite a masterpiece!!  Service was good.  Staff is friendly.  Treated us crazy Americans with patience and kindness.  A must visit!!"}
{"text":"A really great place for brunch, but it can get really busy so the food takes a while to come out. The portions were either reasonable or more than reasonable as I saw how big the neighbouring table's croque monsieur was."}
{"text":"Holy. To think that I didn't know how amazing brunch could be until now is completely unimaginable. My friend couldn't stop talking about this little brunch place after she went for the first time, so I naturally found myself waiting in the rain about a week after. We went on a gloomy Sunday morning, but that didn't seem to have shortened the line-up at all. Inside, all the tables were full; outside, about 20 people were shivering in the cold. Luckily for us, we only waited about 30 minutes in line, and we spent a good portion of it sitting on the bench inside and trying all the iced teas. Because we were three people, we somehow got a table faster than the groups of two. Not sure how that works, but I wasn't going to question it.   For a place that was so busy, service was surprisingly good! We already decided our orders while waiting outside, so we gave them to the waitress immediately after sitting down, and our food came around 15 minutes later. The food, oh my god. Hands down the best french toast, omelette, and potatoes I've ever had in my life. It's been said about 500 times already in the reviews before me, but you have to try that french toast. I got the foie gras and an extra french toast ($5) with no regrets. My friends got the omelette (massive) and a traditional(?) breakfast plate. Both came with baguettes and potatoes, and all three plates came with a smoothie shot and fruit. Thinking about it, I've started drooling again.   I could wax poetry about how amazing it was, but I think I'm just going to go back this week."}
{"text":"Ive seen the pictures on instagram so we decided to go. The place is big with a cute terrace. The staff is friendly and the food was delicious!!!! Definetely worth the price. The small smoothie is so good and the espresso. Must try in Mtl"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best brunch spots I've eaten at. Complimentary comment to the chef because it was amazing. Just everything on the menus was delicious. I definitely recommend this place. The long was long but it was worth every second of it!"}
{"text":"Incredible place for brunch. The food is inventive and the plating is delightful. I had the (gigantic) croque madame. The variations on the eggs benedict that they have all looked incredible, and I would definitely try one the next time I'm here. I love how most orders will come with a small bowl of fruit, and other small side dishes on the same plate. Adorable."}
{"text":"Ate here back in February 2017 with 4 other friends.  Although the wait time was very long (roughly 1h30) it was a beautiful sunny day, so it gave us the opportunity to properly catch up, while taking in some much needed sunlight (and they handed out some free coffee!). Although the place was jam packed, neither the flow nor the service were impacted. The waitresses were very attentive and friendly and we got our orders within a normal amount of time (drinks and food).   The food was; well, it was delicious. I'm not much of a sweets kinda gal, but the waffles with fresh fruits, caramelized maple apples and caramel sauce were amazing. My friends all chose savory dishes (eggs benedict with duck confit, croque madame and more eggs benedict) and they all loved them too. Our freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit mimosas were also delicious, along with their beautiful lattes. Overall, it was a great brunch experience, even though we had a long wait. This can obviously be avoided by arriving early, but we got there at around 11h30 and the place was full (as are all Montreal brunch spots by this time).   For my full review and more photos, check out my blog: Turquoise Blog (link in bio!)"}
{"text":"All the reviews are not lying. The place is AMAZING!!! We can on a Monday and had to wait about 10 min but just as others stare, it was very well worth it!!!  The portions are huge so come hungry. I got a matcha latte which was delicious and cell blended. For breakfast, I got lamb Benedict which was soooooooooooooooo delicious!! The flavors were amazing and lamb was cooked and marinated perfectly. This would definitely be my go to place when I visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"Had heard good things about this place. It was a satisfactory experience. The only but is a rather limited menu compared to some other brunch spots I usually visit in Montreal. Both in items within a meal and the number of items on the menu. Ordered Le Passé Composé breakfast. Has a nice sample of yummy items you find here. The Parisian omelette is  recommended too. Staff are nice. Expect a 15-30 min wait on Sundays.  They serve free coffee outdoor while you are waiting to be seated. Cool idea. The prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Alors là! Je donne un A+ La déco, les plats, oui, nous étions plusieurs, je n'ai pu résisté à l'envie de goûter tous les plats et je dirais que le brunch champetre et la poutine de foie gras sont mes plats favoris. C'est copieux, c'est bon. J'y retourne c'est sûr! Et pour mes amis, je pense qu'ils ont apprécié que le restaurant soit bébés-friendly!!"}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant for brunch twice and was never disappointed.  I went once with my kids and once by myself and both times I was lucky as there were no long lineup. If you like restaurants with outstanding designs, it would probably not be the best place for you (you will notice from my submitted pictures that even the plates need a little bit of revamping). You go to Le Passé Composé for the food and it worth it. I had their Benedictines with foie gras, it was perfectly cooked, I also had their Panko bread which was amazing as well. I strongly recommend this place and it is becoming one of my favourite spot for brunch."}
{"text":"I ordered the gnocchi plate and it was not good at all. It was lacking in taste and presentation. I had to drink a gallon of water afterwards bc of how oily and salty it was.  I will say the service was friendly and great."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place I have been to in my life. The French toast is the most magical piece of food I have ever eaten. Their dishes, though inspired from your typical stalwart breakfast joint plates, are all unique and have that little bit extra.  I've been there twice, and ever since then, everywhere I go (I travel a lot), the question always is \"is it as good as Passé Compose\". The answer has always been no."}
{"text":"UPDATE!  I have updated this review from 3 to 5 stars, to reflect the changes the restaurant has made in its service quality over the past year. Gone are the two surly male servers, and in their place are a team of helpful, happy women who take pride in their work. At the very least, the servers are attentive and efficient, and at their best, they are downright pleasant! And the chef/co-owner will come out to say hi if he's not too busy with the HUGE crowds on the weekends.  To complement the changes in the service, the food is better than ever. The duck confit Benedicts and all of the grilled cheeses are the gold standard in the neighbourhood. Now, it is a MUST TRY in the Plateau! Thank you so much for listening to the concerns of your customers.  ____________  OLD REVIEW (The bad stuff has all been fixed!!!)  My girlfriend and I initially loved...LOVED...Le Passé Composé. We live only a few blocks away and visited five times over the summer and early fall of 2011. The first two times, we sat outside in the beautiful, late-morning sunlight and paid little attention to the finer details of our service. Any foibles were dismissed as coming with the territory of sitting on the terrase (aka, the sidewalk, but with parasols.) In hindsight, maybe we should have learned...but we were young and foolish.  First, though, is the food: The breakfast offerings at Le Passé Composé are simply to die for. The various eggs benedicts are among the best I've ever had, and they use Bearnaise sauce on a couple of them, the Bénédictine and the Florentine, which have made them my go-to favourites. My girlfriend and I have tried the omelets, the crepes and the big, bad Gourmand (their cultured equivalent of a trucker's breakfast) and everything has been of the highest possible quality, even in areas where it's not expected, like the tastiness of the garnishes or the exact perfect amount of sauce.  But.....  My friends from France often regale me with stories of poor, snotty, disinterested, apathetic customer service in their home country. I never knew what they meant until visits 3 through 5 to good ole' \"PC\". I do not know if the staff of this restaurant are from France, but if they're not, I am going to remove the third star from this review which I left on for cultural reasons. There is no other possible excuse.  Le servers at Le Passé Composé would make great antagonists for \"Ratatouille Part Deux\". Their chefs are obviously capable and proud of what they send out, but the front-of-house staff couldn't care less about whether your plates get cleared, whether your water or coffee gets topped up, whether you have enough sugar or milk (you usually don't), if you liked your food, or, frankly, whether you live or die. They will NOT come back to see if you need anything, so, like checking your bag before driving away from a McDonald's drive-thru, I suggest grabbing your server by the apron when they bring your meal, and holding on tight while you inspect everything, because that's the last you'll see of them at your table. Fail at that task, and be prepared to head over to the bar for anything you need from that point on. On top of that, they don't know how to prioritize, and will leave you standing at the door for ten minutes when you arrive, even if there are empty tables galore, because they're too frazzled or apathetic to get you seated with your menus before they take care of something else. I'd say they were understaffed if they had any jump in their step while ignoring you.  So here's the verdict: If you have two hours to kill on a sunny morning, and want to go someplace with a wonderful menu where you can sit outside, drink a nonrefillable beverage, and tip very low (I'd say 4%-6% is warranted if they don't screw up your order) then this may very well be the best place in the Plateau for you! If, however, you value service, like to be attended to more than three times (order, food and bill) and have your simple, quaint needs like \"Puis-j'avoir une fourchette, s'il vous plait?\" addressed respectfully or promptly, your expectations are too high for Le Passé Composé.  I know there is no horror story here, because nothing really bad has ever happened, and the bistro is otherwise beautiful, flavourful and wonderfully located. No, instead the unique phenomenon is a complete lack of service, an absence, an abyss, a black hole, the Anti-Service.  So the entire experience at this neighbouorhood nook is nowhere near \"plus-que-parfait\" and when word gets out about their lack of attention to their customers, they won't be \"présent\" on the culinary scene for long. That's the \"futur simple\" in store if things don't shape up at Le Pass"}
{"text":"Hellooooo fave brunch place. Do I believe in love at first taste? After being here, hell yeah. Their food is awesome and out if the ordinary. They call come with a colorful plate of fruits and a tiny smoothie. The staff is always friendly and nice. They even give u free warm coffee when you wait outside on a cold freezing winter day."}
{"text":"I came here while in town on my \"mini-moon\".  Being from Chicago, we like to think of ourselves as a \"food town\" but this was easily the best brunch I've had in my life.  I don't know how it's possible but everything tasted even better than it looked.  5 Stars all around!"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch. Eggs Benny with side of potatoes and croque Monsieur with a side of potatoes. Both were very delicious. Orange juice was freshly squeezed as advertised (you can taste the difference). Coffee was good as well, which may seem odd to mention but it's sometimes forgotten.   We were only 2 so we were lucky to get a table right away. Ambiance was very \"plateau\" and it works for the restaurant. All in all, well worth it and well worth going back to. Parking is a headache but that's not their fault."}
{"text":"Une belle place pour dej ! Le menu est très diversifié et les plats sont excellents! Par contre, préparez-vous a faire  la file et à payer  Les plats ne sont pas donnés, disons que je n'irais pas dej la a tous les fin de semaine !!"}
{"text":"French toast is to die for! Best out of France! All the food was so good. I always recommend it to friends visiting Montreal. Service is slow, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this popular brunch spot in Montreal on a Saturday. And yup it was packed with the line up for at least 45 min long.   The hostess was very accommodating even with a long line up, she took our request to sit by the window (for better lighting for photos haha)  Ordered 2 egg bennys one with foie gras and the other with pulled pork and shiitake mushrooms. Amazing presentation and tastes great, maybe because we were starving and walked for 45 min and waited for another 45.  A bit disappointed with the \"mango smoothie\" that day. Totally did not taste good even though it looked good and was pricey.  Great ambience, great brunch spot.  Side note: I guess it was my bad for taking too long to eat - was just snapping away at the food. However we did notice our own server giving us \"the look.\" Eat your food! Yes."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots in Montreal. The mood is great. Staff are super friendly. I had the Portuguese poached eggs which were perfect. Definitely a must visit when in MTL."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés bruncher avec 3 de nos amis au passé composé car nous y étions allés plusieurs fois et à chaque fois nous avions bien mangé, même si à chaque fois le service laissait à désirer..  Les serveuses ne sont aucunement souriantes et on dirait qu'on leur fait clairement chier à venir manger chez eux. Une des deux serveuses commençait à nous débarrasser avant même que tout le monde ait fini et elle a même failli me l'enlever alors que j'étais clairement en train de manger encore. On se sent donc légèrement agressé alors qu'on était venu passer un moment tranquille.  Après le paiement, la serveuse n'a même pas voulu dire aurevoir parce qu'elle devait juger qu'on ne lui avait pas laissé assez de pourboire, ce qui démontre vraiment encore une fois un manque de professionnalisme.  J'ai mis une étoile seulement juste parce qu'on a très mangé mais honnêtement, je ne pense pas y retourner et je ne manquerai pas de déconseiller cet endroit à mes amis"}
{"text":"You wait its true and you don't pay cheap but boyyy its sooooo WORTH IT. Best brunch place in the WORLD!"}
{"text":"Bruncher à Montréal, c'est top ! Surtout quand on y est en vacances et qu'on a du temps libre en semaine. Sur les conseils avisés d'une québecoise, nous nous sommes rendus ici. L'ambiance est relativement calme et bien loin de la folie du Plateau sur l'avenue Mont Royal. Néanmoins, l'attente y est donc bien réduite puisque nulle !  J'ai été relativement simple sur mon choix en prenant le déjeuner gourmand composé de bacon, saucisses, fèves au lard, des oeufs brouillés et du pain baguette ainsi que des fruits frais. Le service est rapide, l'accueil correct bien que moins chaleureux que nos autres expériences.  Si vous voulez éviter la cohue des autres endroits, cette adresse est un bon spot pour bruncher."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me, knows that I love brunch and I love it even more when the presentation of it is beautiful. I creeped Le Passe Compose really hard before coming and was SO excited to come. Zero disappointment -hands down one of the best brunch spots I have ever been to in my life. I find that a lot of brunch places are overpriced for what they serve. While they serve some standard items here, they also serve some more interesting plates such as the duck confit poached egg I had. It was served with butternut squash, Parmesan, chives, white Porto sauce, and potato waffles. The butternut squash with the egg and duck created such a great explosion of flavours. Also, I'm not a big sauce person but that white porto sauce was A-mazing and I just wish I could bottle it up and bring home a gallon!  I also tried their croque madame (rustic bread, white ham, d'Auvergne cheese, Bechamel sauce, old cheddar, poached egg, arugula and endive salad caramelized with sherry). While I am no connoisseur of croque madames I just know that this was a huge potion of DELICIOUS things coming together. The bread was amazing as an added bonus and the pictures speak for themselves because the plating was just beautiful. I wish that this place would exist in Toronto because I would come ALL the time. OBSESSED."}
{"text":"Everything was great for breakfast, especially the panko french toast, which is worth the visit by itself"}
{"text":"Couldn't have been happier. The meal was absolutely delicious and every single ingredient tasted so fresh! I would highly recommend this spot. The pain d'oré was a perfect \"dessert\" for breakfast."}
{"text":"Ate all over Canada in several trips and this is my favorite place. All I could think about was how I'm going to find similar food back in LA.   Pros:  - duck grilled cheese - foie gras eggs Benedict - Fried french toast  - celery root soup - apple beignet - presentation and price on point   Cons:  - parking is a bit scarce"}
{"text":"The food here is insanely good! My friends and I came here 2 days in a row for brunch during our short trip in Montreal. Food is on the pricier side but it is worth it. The portions are great and each comes with a few sides, fresh fruits, a smoothie shot, and more fruits. The duck confit was so rich in flavor and definitely satisfied my tastebuds. Mimosa was tasty as well. Definitely come early to avoid the crowds. I would definitely come back if I come to Montreal again."}
{"text":"Finally, I came... most of my friends rave about this place non stop. I am also reuniting with friends that I haven't seen for long time.   Fantastic place to reunite with amazing food. The service is good. Our waitress was announcing the specials and notifying there is one crumble left. I jumped to it; and said I would have that. We also ordered Mimosa(mix of orange and grapefruit juice). Delicious!!! My other two friends got the French toast and pesto/cheese omelette. When our food arrived, I was awed by the beautiful presentation. I was also impressed with their choice of fruits. Usually, for any breakfast place, the usual fruits are cantaloupe, grapes, strawberries, banana...but at Le Pasée Composé, the choice of fruits are exotic, like figs, dragon fruit, and blueberries, with toppings of lavender flowers. I had three glass of 1)warm peach with vanilla yogurt 2) crumbles and 3)berry smoothie, and on the side toast, spread of Ricotta cheese, sprinkled with chia seeds and lavender flower. Just by writing the description; I can taste the food again. One word: Succulent. My friends loved their dishes immensely.  Amazing place... I want go back ASAP."}
{"text":"Unreal food. Like just mindblowing. It is a little expensive but definitely worth it if you wanna treat yourself or someone else. The decor is beautiful and the service is fantastic. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"By far the best brunch place I've been to- everything from the food to ambiance and service was amazing! We ordered 7 dishes and everything was perfectly plated and delicious. There was a bit of a wait but I'd say worth it. Will make a trip to Montreal again for this place"}
{"text":"Brunch is my favorite meal. Passe composé is in my top 5 brunch places! This time, i tried the duck benedict, it was awesome. The blend of the bread snd the duck was just so perfect and the sauce was not heavy at all. I only had the one egg, because i was not that hungry. But after my first bite, I really regret not taking the two eggs..."}
{"text":"Went there with friends for brunch and enjoyed the whole experience. Very quaint atmosphere, friendly service and excellent pricing. I would highly recommend this place to all."}
{"text":"I went there recently with friends for brunch and experienced the worst service after being there several times in the past. It took them over an hour to bring me my gauffre maison which I ordered even though it wasn't that busy. After I complained to the manager, they offered & I accepted the free meal. I obviously didn't leave a tip. I'm never going back again."}
{"text":"Breakfast so good you'll want to hug everyone on your way out. I always thought omelettes are a nice thing to eat, but whoever is making them at passé composé is taking things to a new level. I'm going to have to come back to Montreal just to eat at place again."}
{"text":"Très bon brunch, réputé Un peu dispendieux toutefois, mais c'est vrai que pour l'originalité et la fraicheur des plats, ça vaut la peine Dommage que le café ne soit pas inclus avec les plats Aussi certains plats viennent avec des fruits et d'autres non, il vaut mieux demander avant dans le doute, pour ne pas être déçu (mais ça pourrait être écrit sur la carte..) Au niveau des plats, il y a des plats à l'agneau braisé, foie gras poêlé, saumon fumé, oignons confits, champignons, bref, il y a plein plein de choix et des items de qualité! Large choix de boissons aussi, cafés alcolisés, etc.. Très bon service, agréable et souriant A essayer à tout prix! A noter que la fin de semaine, il vaut mieux arriver à 10h car ça se remplit vite! A midi il y a un bon line up déjà!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast hub! I went there because I've heard a lot of great things in the last few months about this place and I was pleased with the service, the food and the atmosphere of the restaurant. Would highly recommend. I had the egg with foie gras (my girlfriend had the same because that's what Yelp folks recommended)."}
{"text":"Great brunch place - food is very well executed and service is great. The poached egg plate (with pulled pork and mushroom) and the panko french bread (it's crunchy!) were both delicious! I like that the entree comes with a side of fruit and a shot of smoothie - gives me a (false) sense that I'm eating something healthy... =D  The omelette in the table next to us also looked scrumptious.   We arrived very early on the Sunday morning, right as the restaurant opened. The place already started to fill up by the time we left around 9:30am (still a few tables open then). I imagine a line will start to form after 10am."}
{"text":"We arrived at 12h Saturday to a long lineup of hopeful brunchers. It was a bit cold, so the stand of free, hot coffee and milk outside was a welcoming sight. It took a whole hour to get seated, but we were in a good mood and excited to see for ourselves what Le Passé Composé was all about. We were lucky to sit in a corner, next to the large windows, the D.R.E.A.M. table for picture-taking foodies. Unluckily, we waited another whole hour after placing our order, and ended up receiving our food 20 mins before closing time. That didn't really sit well with us.  Nevertheless, the food looked impeccable (we got the \"Rural Poached Eggs\" and the \"Passé Composé Breakfast\"). The plates were coloful, the portions were generous, and everything was well prepared. I think they ran out of the mango, because we got raspberry shots instead. The poached eggs were probably the best I ever had - the sauce was rich and creamy, the pulled pork combined well with the wild mushrooms, and the thick slices of toast underneath covered with pesto. My boyfriend's breakfast platter was perhaps less exciting, but still a solid amount of food. The potatoes were underseasoned, but the ham was delicious and eggs were good. His favorite part was the French toast, which he smothered with maple syrup.   I would go back (they have quite a number of delicious-sounding items on their menu), but I'll make sure to get there at opening time to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"J'ai été ravis d'être cliente en ce mardi midi tranquille. Le resto offre maintenant le service le lundi et mardi. Nous étions 3 et avons tous apprécié nos choix. Les smoothie mangue lime trop bon et le pain doré Panko et mon omelette délicieuse ..... pas donné mais la qualité est au rdv alors pour se gâter pourquoi pas"}
{"text":"It fulfills its role excellently. All the components of their standard brunch set was perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned - French toast was sweet but not too much so, sausage was salty but not too much so, etc. No qualms with service or decor either - its reputation is rightly earned, and I definitely plan on returning :)"}
{"text":"One of the best brunch meals I had in Montreal in 2017. Would definitely go back to try everything on their menu."}
{"text":"Love this place sooooooooo much. My NO. 1 brunch restaurant in Montreal! Food here is amazing. I also love the name of this place, as well as its decoration. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Exceptional food. Expensive but refined dishes. They need to get their placing system organized. The free coffee for those who are ind the waiting line is a great idea but someone has to refill regularly."}
{"text":"Ohhh my Passe Compose! This is my favorite brunch spot in Montreal. I have had nothing but positive experiences there. I have tried a lot off their menu but what stands out most for me is their cheese omelette and french toast. Believe me when I say that the french toast is LIFE CHANGING. Please please try this heavenly french toast. They offer little samples of smoothies too and their mango smoothie was out of this world. Service has always been good and staff is very friendly. Highly recommended!  Side note: this place is so popular that I had my first celebrity sighting there. Sansa Stark from Game of Thrones was brunching it up there. Joe Jonas was there as well...but yeah SANSA STARK! Enough said."}
{"text":"2 words....FRENCH TOAST!  I went here with a few friends for a late breakfast.  I was very lucky that there was no line to deal with as it was a rainy morning so I assume the regulars were off to a late start because 20 minutes after we sat down the place was packed with a line going into the rain.  I was suprised as it is a bit expensive for breakfast but as long as you go with smart choices it should be in a decent budget. Now the food ... oh la la! Got a simple breakfast plate but I had to try the French Toast and I must say I wasn't disappointed.  I did sample from my friends plates and they were all quite good. Service is friendly and efficient and the decor is warm and relaxing.  Just keep in mind to come earlier than later if you want to avoid the line. I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. Sit outside in the garden on a nice day. Friendly waiters. Delicious and innovative food. Creative takes on traditional foods. Slightly more expensive than I wanted but worth it. Coming back my next time in Montreal."}
{"text":"WOW! This place is beyond amazing - from start to finish. They sat us VERY quickly with a group of 6, the server was knowledgeable, friendly and the food was out of this world. It was such a beautiful display I had to of course Instagram it! We even went back a second time during our stay. If you are in town, this is a MUST visit."}
{"text":"Their salmon bagel is TOP NOTCH !  Seriously amazing The benedict was probably 3/5 nothing special Its an hour wait and i would say the salmon bagel is worth the wait !"}
{"text":"AMAZING brunch place! It took them mire than 30 minutes to bring us our food but it was totally worth the waiting! We came early (around 9am) but when we left the line outside was insane! so come early or with patience.  I want to visit Montreal again just so I can re-visit Le Passé Composé :)"}
{"text":"Holy shit, this place has redefined breakfast in Montreal. The menu has so many(maybe too many) choices that it took me like 30 minutes to decide. I kept flipping between pages trying to eliminate one from my top 5. Then the waitress came and told us about 5 off menu items only available today! You people are killing me! No wonder there is a line up around the block! I opted for a rabbit poached egg. It was so rich and decadent I could only eat half. I felt bad for the poor rabbit I was wasting. I also tried their beet smoothie which was one of the best I've had.    Everybody at the table was in heaven with everything they ordered. You must try this place!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot...my understanding is there is often a wait for a table on a Sunday morning. We must have timed it just right...our party of 5 arrived at 9:30an and a table had just opened up-we were seated right away. Breakfast selections are many and very cool. The portions are almost too big. I had the vegetarian omelet with pesto and goat cheese. It came with potatoes, choice of bread and the best side of fruit! Typically the side of fruit includes a strawberry, some flavorless cantaloupe or watermelon. Here it came with strawberries, orange, grapefruit, pineapple cherry tomato and earth cherries! We also ordered the Panko encrusted French Toast, The Three Cheese Omelet & Homemade Waffles. Everything was delicious-the service was great and the atmosphere had a really cool vibe. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, this is what I expect from a Montreal breakfast/brunch restaurant.   We came Osheaga weekend (risky, right?) but showed up at 9:00am and beat all the line ups and were served very quickly and efficiently.   I ordered the Eggs Benedict with pulled pork and mushrooms. It was very tasty and filling (i got the two eggs option). They were cooked beautifully but I can't help but feel that something was missing. A bit of seasoning maybe? My friends all got the same thing, the salmon bagel avocado sandwich. They all enjoyed it but none of them could really finish the half of the avocado that was put into the sandwich. It was deepfried - but very lightly breaded, and the avocado texture/amount was a bit overwhelming (I tried it myself). If you're an avo toast kinda person then you'll probably enjoy it.   The service was extremely friendly and I would definitely go back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Thanks to our local friends in Montreal who led us to this local restaurant and discovered the richest and butteriest French Toast on earth! I never thought French Toast could be so soft and crispy at the same time. It is just the right amount of sweetness and one toast is enough to satisfy your hunger and desire.   I happened to order the Spanish Omelet since I always feel like French Toast is a sin (too much sugar, carb and butter). My Spanish Omelet comes with Chorizo, asparagus and cheese and it is very tasty with their homemade dipping sauce. Their home fries is superb with hint of rosemary. However, I must say the French toast is the real winner here.   The dish all comes with fresh fruit or salad and somehow the fresh fruit makes me feel less guilty about having such a heavy meal. I did order a croissant to go with my omelet and it was fluffy and buttery!   The only complaint I have is that the waitress seems to be the only one working in this neighborhood gem, which slows down their service."}
{"text":"Très bonne ambiance pour un brunch du dimanche matin ;) Les prix sont assez élevés mais les plats sont très beaux, copieux et excellents"}
{"text":"Passe Compose finished off my Montreal eating vacation, which included Joe Beef, APdC, Wilensky's, Schwartz's, and Fairmont Bagel. Off all those places, Passe Compose is the one I'd likely be a regular at.  The restaurant is a cozy, perfectly sized breakfast spot. The service was a bit slow, but very kind, and even patient with our terrible attempts at French.  The food was awesome. The menu includes a broad range of breakfast classics. I chose from the oeuf poche portion of the menu, which I believe translates to eggs Benedict. The pork eggs benedict I enjoyed was easily the best I've had. The pork taste was subtle, nestled in a potato underneath the egg and sauce.  My friend ordered a gnocchi poutine special, which was packed with umami flavor. If you're here and this is still on the menu, order it.  I'd come back every Sunday if I could. It surpassed all expectations I could have for a breakfast joint, but didn't do anything that absolutely blew me away."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. The veggie omelette was really tasty, although too salty. The panko French toast is worth a try, it's just a bit greasy/oily. The food presentation was delightful, the meal came with carefully arranged fruit and mango juice."}
{"text":"Not my best experience! From the photo food sounded very exciting and delicious! In reality, nothing special! The service was slow too! I won't go back"}
{"text":"La nourriture était bonne, cela dit l'expérience a été gâchée par des soucis facilement évitable. Nous étions 2 personne, mon plat est arrivé en premier, à moitié froid, ca se voyait que mon plat était rester longtemps en attente avant qu'on le serve. Ensuite on ne nous donne aucune explication ni excuse mais on doit réclamer le second plat pour qu'il arrive. La encore pas d'excuse et on nous dit qu'il arrive bientôt. Le plat de ma copine arrive tout chaud tout frais et est délicieux cela dit un des oeufs pochés était trop cuit. En gros j'avais des attentes assez élevées du service et de l'endroit mais j'ai été déçu. Les serveurs sont très sympathiques mais n'ont pas l'air de ce soucier de notre expérience"}
{"text":"Amazing food, nice ambience, and reasonable price. Tip- apparently if you order two eggs on the poached egg platter they double your order for $4 more than the single egg (see photo)"}
{"text":"This is what happens when you come to US to Canada: find this amazing food! Oh my god! Just eat the Classic Passé Compose breakfast and start to cry! How the heck they do that French toast!"}
{"text":"Warning: only come here if you have LOTS of time to kill, or have a book to read, or a friend with whom you have a lot to catch up on...  I came here because I thought the wait at L'avenue, which has the most yelp reviews for brunch in montreal, would be too long.  The waitress told  us it would be about a 30 minute wait, and \"possibly longer\". We ended up waiting for 1.5 hours, which I don't think is justified for ANY restaurant unless it's the top restaurant in the entire city...   I was so hungry once the food came that I wasn't sure if I was able to taste everything properly, but I tried the foie gras eggs benedict, and the foie was delicious.  There was about 5 small pieces of foie, and I enjoyed the fact that the bread on the bottom was thick cut and soft; perfect for dipping into the foie gras sauce!  They are really good at presentation, and seasonal fruits were split into two small square cups, and a shot glass of their smoothie was also on the plate. The dish itself was better than average, but NOT worth a 1.5 hour wait; I would of waited 30 minutes max.  We literally finished our food without talking in 15 minutes since we were all beyond hungry.   Atmosphere is really cozy and decorated nicely; there is also patio seating. The servers seem stressed though, probably due to the many clients staring expectantly at them, waiting for their food to arrive.  Perhaps going right when they open would be a better idea. I went at 1:00PM and didn't get the food  until 2:30PM (and 2:30PM is when the kitchen closes for brunch)!   Bottom line: better than average and beautiful for pictures, but be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Simply outstanding brunch! Excellent flavours and an amazing menu. Group of six and everyone LOVED everything they ordered. If there's one place you should eat at in Montreal, this is it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best places to get brunch in Montreal.  If this place has one problem, it's that you won't be able to choose what to get.  Also the number of veg-friendly options is limited but what they have will make you happy.  The staff are very friendly and keep up with you no matter how busy it gets.  One more thing; come early!  The lineups get long after 10."}
{"text":"Cher pour la petite portion. Toutefois très belle sélection variée et plus sophistiquée que la moyenne de déjeuners. Bon service rapide."}
{"text":"Food was delicious definitely would recommend the duck confit poach eggs. The service was excellent and the bloody Mary's were delicious also. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait!!! You might want to come early in the morning (before 10 am) on weekends, otherwise you will be waiting for at least 40 mins. It was sooo hard to choose what to order because everything on the menu sounded so good and original. We ended up getting pulled pork egg benedict and grilled cheese escargot sandwich. Egg benedict was SO GOOD! Generous amount of sauce, meat, and mushrooms! One egg was enough for me because it was huge! It also comes with complimentary fruits and a shot of smoothie. The grilled cheese sandwich was also good! It is quite heavy, but the salad balances it out pretty well.   Very reasonably priced for what you get. I can't wait to come back and try other menus. Service was also quick and friendly. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"A bit expensive but It's worthy. We had goose liver poached eggs and duck pumpkin poached eggs. I love the duck one very much! It has some chips as decorations and the ducks and pumpkin are mixed well as the base. It's not only looking good but also tasting well. Goose livers are bit salty and not very special except the price of the liver."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant! I've been several times. The food has always been good. And the service is quite friendly as well. I really don't have anything negative to say, I guess that's a good thing!"}
{"text":"The hype is justified with the French toast. Definitely going back again tomorrow. Hoping to try the waffles but I may have to have the French Toast again. It's that good. It really will ruin French Toast at any other place after you have theirs.  Staff is great. Food presentation is over the top - it's basically an excuse to Instagram. Apple Beignets, bacon and potatoes were great sides, but it really is all about that French Toast."}
{"text":"The food was definitely worth it, it is not the reason why I'm leaving a bad review.  It all started with a line up outside, which was expected. After 30 minutes of waiting outside, we get inside where twe still had a few people in front of waiting to get seated. Then... THEN. This guy -that was mainly on his phone- comes to us and say '45 minutes to wait MINIMUM' with the emphasis on the last word. No 'hello good morning' or whatsoever. His eyebrows were raised as if he was expecting us to leave after waiting 30 minutes and being told this. It was also surprising since there was only a group of 4 people before us. We said we would still wait. Then he dgoes to the back of the line and invites everyone to wait on the terrace with a cup of coffee. Nice way to treat us. After 30 more minutes, he comes back to us and points a table without a word. Wow.  asked if there was some space on the terrace, since more than one table were empty inside the restaurant (and yes, we still had to wait...). He said 'no or you'll wait more, whatever you want'. We decided to take the table he so nicely pointed. After that, the waitress was super nice and the food was good. But only because of this individual, I would not go back. Is he the owner? If so, big thank you to your cooks and waiters for doing a great job because they're saving you. You have no manners."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever tried in this place has been gastro-phenomenal if that's even a word. The presentation, taste, portion and service is without any fault. The excitement you feel as you see your food arrive, let's just say that this place will fulfill your brunch expectations and if you're from the States expect to be mind blown by MTL food quality and standards. I love this place and the prices are so worth it."}
{"text":"The breakfast potatoes in the \"Le Plus\" are freaking gnocci seasoned perfectly and covered with freshly grated Parmesan. Every detail is done perfectly. Every dish placed at tables next to us was equally incredible looking. Portions are quite generous. On the pricier side of my usual brunch trips, but 100% worth it."}
{"text":"Worth the wait but don't be in a hurry.  Food is phenomenal. You won't be sorry eating here."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE.  This was our first brunch spot for our bachelorette party and it really set the bar high. No matter what people may say below, but they DO take reservations so call early! We ended up waiting over 2 hours for our party of 10 to sit down, but my oh my it was well worth it!  Half of us shared a variety of things, but highlights included: French toast - wow, it was breaded with panko and deep fried (people said it was the best they've ever had) Croque madam - the waitress warned me it was big, but i was starving so beware. I opted for goat cheese instead of blue cheese which was fantastic amongst the endive salad! YUMMM and the bread was thick and so crisp! Definitely recommend Foie Gras benedict - huge pieces of foie gras so it was worth the price tag, loved that it came with a fruit salad and smoothie Pork benedict - interesting combination of flavors, i liked how the sweet potato offset the richness of the pork Mushroom benedict - probably my least favorite as I'm much more of a carnivore, but the flavors were very earthy and fresh"}
{"text":"*sigh*  What can I say about this place. They redefined brunch Cons: no reservation: Everybody and their mama now knows about it so the wait can be ri-Di-cu-lous!  Very small table   PROS:  Best breakfast you'll ever have  You'll never look at ordinary french toast the same again   We went around 11 on a Saturday morning. The wait wasn't too bad but I went back on another sunny Saturday around noon and there was 25 names before me.   We shared the panko crusted French toast. I need to pause because it was too damn good. Crunchy yet moist. Pure Perfection.   Then we had two different types of Benedict egg. One had pulled lamb and the other foie gras on a brioche bread. I can't even. Cut yourself out of your misery and just go. Drops mic."}
{"text":"L'endroit est vraiment beau, le menu est intéressant, le repas est bon, mais l'attente est interminable!  J'ai pris des crêpes bananes, la présentation était inattendue et le plat était très bon. L'omelette végé était aussi très bonne. Malheureusement ce brunch a été gâché par 10 minutes d'attente pour avoir la facture, puis encore 10 minutes avant de payer. Tout ça pendant que 15 personnes attendent une table... Une expérience client à revoir!"}
{"text":"Belle découverte! Le menu est alléchant du début à la fin, c'est vraiment difficile choisir. Plusieurs choix pour enfant aussi. Le café est délicieux. Il faut arriver tôt parce que passer 9h ça se rempli vraiment rapidement!"}
{"text":"Breakfast (brunch) here is outstanding. I am a former Montrealer now living in the U.S. And I make it a point to go to Le Passé Composé every single time I'm in town. There is no other breakfast place like this: the menu, the food, the presentation... Umami for all the senses. Just learned that they can open in the evenings for a group of 20 or more. I will definitely consider this for the next family & friends reunion. Love."}
{"text":"J'ai visité 2 fois, avec ma copine. La première fois, on nous a servi nos plats en retard et tièdes: les ufs étaient froids. On voulait lui donner une 2ème chance, en passant durant la semaine. C'était une mauvaise expérience: on nous a fait attendre 1h, alors que la moitié du resto était vide. En attendant, d'autres sont arrivés après nous, mais ont les a installé sans attendre. En voulant comprendre la situation, j'ai parlé avec la gérante qui ma répondu sèchement que si ca nous plaisait pas on pouvait quitter."}
{"text":"Holy crow, I will dream of this place when I leave. I will long for the day I can return. I got the crumble...hazelnuts and walnuts crumbled in a granola/cookie crumble, with a berry smoothie, baked cinnamon apples, and a sweet Greek yogurt, all with two pieces of toasted baguette with ricotta, honey, and maple syrup.   My husband got a smoked salmon benedict. He loved it.  Everything out of the kitchen here looks amazing. We will probably be back every day we can before we head back to the States."}
{"text":"One of the only places in Montreal where it's worth waiting in line for a long time to have a delicious brunch. Long to get in for groups, but shouldn't be too bad for 2 people. We waiting a long time to get our orders too. Love how their plates come with all these small extras, the bread is so good!! I tried the Plus que Parfait and the Beignes, a must !"}
{"text":"It's worth waiting in line to eat the food , try the French toast it's the best I've had , and eggs Benedict  are to die for"}
{"text":"I still think about that french toast!! I had the duck poached eggs and it was very good--very rich, but a little too heavy for me so it was hard to finish the whole thing. The fruits were delicious too! I liked the variety. The sourness of them was refreshing. Next time I will try something lighter as my main dish. I came on a weekday morning so there was no wait. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday after finding it on yelp. I love the plateau area and this cozy brunch spot is another reason why. There was no line but not sure if this is the norm. The place was not too big and seemed to be a garage before which is common of many restaurants here. The colour scheme is quite simple with blocks of red and white and just a few trendy pieces. The menu was organized into three main sections: savoury crepes, sweet crepes and eggs Benedict. I automatically narrowed in on the eggs Benedict and ordered Le Bleue which has blue cheese, walnuts and prosciutto. I'm usually not a big fan of blue cheese but decided to be adventurous that day. All eggs Benedict comes with a tray of yogurt, fruits, fried potatoes, and coffee. Just looking at the tray made me happy and opened up my appetite for the main. The blue cheese was definitely more palatable with the prosciutto and eggs but I have to be honest, it got too heavy by the end so just a warning if you're not a huge fan of the blue. I also tried the smoked salmon eggs Benedict which I would recommend as well, you can never go wrong with smoked salmon. All in all, I had a good experience and would recommend you to check it out especially if you want to avoid the long line ups at the other more popular brunch spots."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! Well prepared versions of traditional dishes. Enough unique touched to be interesting, but not to be trying too hard. Thoroughly enjoyed the Croque Madame and the Portugese eggs benedict. Go for a leisurely brunch and get a patio spot. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Came here two days in a row during easter weekend. Best Tio I got online was to get here before 10am which I did. Glad I did. After we were seated there was a long line out the door so def get there before 10am. Service staff is excellent. Courteous, attentive and friendly. Now, on to the good stuff: food! My first day I ordered Le dejeuner du passé compossé which has everything i want in a breakfast cooked to perfection. Look it up. The French toast is incredibly crunchy and delicious. Second day I had the poché champetre also cooked to perfection. Portions with two eggs are really nice size, you'll be full! Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"I would rate this spot 3.5 stars for brunch. This place was totally packed when we went there...and there was a line up to get in. They had free coffee outside but with the temperature being -20 outside we didn't bother to even try it. We were lucky as we were seated pretty quickly. We ordered the french toast and Le tête à tête. I asked my eggs to be fried and fully cooked but they came in over-easy. The presentation was nice and clean with the fresh fruits in two small bowls. There was also free tea or coffee with your order. The other thing I noticed is that the servers were all women. The service was a bit on the slower side as we found ourselves starving when the food finally showed up. The food tasted fine...I loved their hash browns which was diced potatoes tossed in with some green onions. The flavours were great. The other sides (fruits, toast) and the french toast were just routine and nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Holy cow, now THIS is the way to brunch! After finally getting into the restaurant, I saw how beautiful all the plates were and felt newly motivated to wait another half an hour.    Ordered the foie gras poached eggs and passé composé breakfast and began another long wait for the food to arrive.  When they came, our plates were...freakin' beautiful. A poke with the knife sent the egg yolk oozing onto the brioche and mixing with the foie gras sauce. The fresh fruits were vibrant and provided a nice contrast from the rich flavour of the foie gras.  Poppy seeds on the cantaloupe was a nice touch! My only comment is that the eggs were a bit too vinegary.    Passé composé breakfast was also impressive with its tasty, filling components.   Delicious food, excellent presentation, great experience."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The combination of bacon, egg and bread was very impressive. Potato was cooked with garlic and wasvery flavourful. The staff was very friendly and bilingal. The decoration inside is kinda industrial and relaxing. Although the line up was a bit long when we went there at around 1, I think it is still worth the wait. Will revisit next time when we come to Montreal. :) We both ordered two classique ones and both were good. Mine is the Plus One Classique (probably not the exact name), love the beans!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! I had a latte and split the duck confit Benedict with butternut squash cakes and potato waffle chips, and a side of French toast. Everything was delicious and it was more than enough food. The confit had a beautiful presentation, and I loved the little fruit sides. I had a sip of a mocha coffee, which was great. Great soundtrack here, too."}
{"text":"These people are super rude if you can't speak French. Don't bother asking for an English menu. Next level eyes rolls.   About the food... French brunch fare, not shy to use butter, pretty presentation, on the heavy side. Everything was delicious but the lack of service and general attitude detracted from the experience.   I won't be back. Je suis not sorry."}
{"text":"Le passé composé is a cute spot in the village. The brunch is very popular, almost too popular. We went on a Sunday at noon, and waited for an hour to get in, and another hour to get our food. This is quite disappointing. We wished the service was a bit more accommodating, for example, bring our drink orders earlier rather than along with the food almost an hour later. And be more efficient in seating people to move the queue along faster. Some tables have 2 people taking up the whole 4 seats.   Now that the rant is over, I can get back to the food. It was quite awesome! I ordered poached eggs with ham, oyster mushrooms and mushroom sauce on brioche bread. It's basically eggs Benedict by another name. It also comes with three small bowls of fresh fruits and smoothie. The ham is meaty and the mushroom complements the dish very well.   Overall it was very delicious! But it's probably not worth the long wait..."}
{"text":"Was so glad that I stumbled upon this restaurant while browsing through Instagram! Best brunch food I have ever tasted, hands down!  I got the authentic grilled cheese sandwich which is a delicious combo of sweet and savoury - would highly recommend! Tried some of my Dad's French toast too which was also amazing.   The restaurant is on the smaller side so I would definitely suggest making a reservation. My only complaint is that the restaurant never seems to have enough staff working so the wait is fairly long for having your order taken, table cleared, etc. They also brought out my meal about 5 minutes after everyone else's so my family awkwardly began without me. Despite this, the food is 100% worth it! I will definitely be back the next time I visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Food was amazing, but the wait was too long. The french toast is a good starter, and the eggs benedict are great! Recommended for a weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: The place looked and felt awesome. It felt quaint, yet modern with giant windows that fill the entire service floor with sunlight; beautiful for brunch. Seating was cozy, albeit a little bit on the tight side.  Service: Service was on par. The waitresses were on the ball, pleasant, and gave us a decent amount of attention, given how busy it was when we were there.  Food: I had two oeuf poché florentine with a side of potatoes. The food was well presented on the plate and the eggs were poached perfectly. The biggest complaint about the dish was that it was too sweet. I believe it was the garlic confit that overpowered the dish with sweetness. Don't get me wrong, the dish was good; however, the sweetness was really starting to get to me by the second egg.  Value: My portion of the bill came up to 33$, tips in, for two eggs florentine, a side of potatoes, and an orange juice. While the atmosphere and service does seem to match the price, though my dish unfortunately fell a little flat, dragging the score down.  Overall, I'd go again to treat myself a nice brunch outing or to impress someone."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! It's located in the Gay Village. We came around 12 pm on a Sunday and the line was outside the door. The people in front of us told us that the line usually takes 1-2 hours, but we decided to wait because I wanted to try the infamous Foie Gras Eggs Benedict. (While youre waiting, they have complementary hot coffee with milk/cups/stirrers outside, which definitely helps in the cold!)  Finally after 1.5 hours, we were seated. The service was great, and the menu was extensive. I of course went with the Foie Gras Benny and my bf went with the Portuguese Eggs Benny which came with different sausages and onion rings. We also ordered a side of home grilled potatoes and sausages, which were delicious.   The eggs benedict both leaked out perfectly and the foie gras was quicker great (except it had too much salt on it). The cute little dishes of fruit and mini-berry shakes they give you with your meal are also great."}
{"text":"I had one day to freely explore Montreal and I decided that brunching was a must. I found Le Passé Composé through researching yelp and decided it was a winner.   I arrived around 12:00pm on a Saturday and there was a line in waiting. Although I wasn't expecting it, it didn't surprise me. If anything it only hyped me up (who waits for food that isn't good?). I would ballpark the wait to be an hour - dress warmly!! The better part of the wait was outside.   I was offered the option of a table or the bar and I chose the table. Menus are offered in both French and English (blessed). I ended up ordering the duck confit poached eggs and a side of French toast. The entree comes with a side of fruit and you have the option of choosing one poached egg or two. The French toast was mouth watering - truly. I don't know how they make it but it's definitely not the same as what you would get in the States.   Staff were super nice!! My waiter was able to offer me suggestions and continuously made a point to check up on me even though it was crazy busy.    A great experience to kick off my day. No regrets on brunching here. I'll definitely be back for more French toast."}
{"text":"10/10 breakfast. One of the top breakfasts I've ever had. Cute place. Great coffee. Great food. Good portion sizes. Worth it. Loved it."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for brunch, very clean, the food was incredible (especially the French toast), and the vibe was great. The wait staff was accommodating and provided a menu in English since we do not speak French. The only thing I think they could improve is the speed of service. It was well worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"Went early on a Sunday morning and was one of the first groups there.   The plates looked extremely impressive and were presented beautifully with a little bit of smoothie and nice fruit selection on every plate. I also loved being able to choose baguette as my type of bread with the meal.  I ordered the Spanish omelette which included chorizo, goat cheese, and spinach. I found it extremely salty and overloaded with goat cheese- so rich and salty that I had trouble even eating half of it.   The plates were big, presentation nice, but the actual food is not the best. Or maybe I didn't order the right thing. My latte was good but it's hard to get a latte wrong.   Probably won't be back here- likely going to stick to Le Cartet."}
{"text":"About 5 minutes walk from metro Beaudry. My friend and I went for brunch at this cute little place. We went around 10 am on a Wednesday, service was fast and great. The menu was in French and so was the server but when he noticed we were more Anglophone... He easily switched to English. The food was delicious and nicely plated (instaworthy) I must say the winner part of the dish is definitely the panko French toast. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, sweet but not overly sweet. It was absolutely amazing! The dish also came with a sample size of the smoothie of the day. Today, it was mango lime which was very tasty. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and my friend and I definitely had food coma. We were full until supper!   Price: le dejeuner passé composé: 20$"}
{"text":"Being from Toronto, every time I go to MTL, I look forward to brunch the most! L'Avenue is our usual spot, but gave this place a try. Had the Foie Gras Eggs Benny and it was really good, although not as good as L'Avenue for Eggs Benny IMO. However, we also had the Croque Madame and a side of French Toast and they were both awesome!  So if all you care about is Eggs Benny, L'Avenue may still be a better choice. However, if you want a good overall brunch, I think Le Passe Compose is better! The atmosphere is nice, service is great, and the food overall is excellent."}
{"text":"A MUST if you are visiting Montreal! It was a 5 minute walk from our Airbnb, which was right next to Metro Beaudry/Gay Village. Luckily our wait wasn't long at all since it was a snowy weekend, but the prices are reasonable and the staff was very helpful, as well as kind.  Definitely try the duck confit poached egg and foie gras eggs benedict! Love that it comes with fruit too. Eyed a bunch of other foods that others were eating too and wish we had more stomach room for more!"}
{"text":"Adepte du déjeuner, on voulait essayer une nouvelle place ! D'abord, armez vous de patience, la place roule à pleine capacité jusqu'à 2h de l'après-midi! Toutefois, une fois assis et avec un bon café (il est très bon) vous vous sentirez mieux ! D'ailleurs, point de plus pour le café servis dehors pendant l'attente ! Bref, le menu est REMPLI de choix qui ont tous l'air meilleur que l'autre! il est donc très ardu de faire un choix ! J'ai opté pour les crêpes banane et nutella et mon copain a pris l'assiette avec les oeufs pochés et le veau effiloché. Les deux étaient fabuleuses et l'extra creton vaut vraiment le 4$ !   Par contre, le service laisse à désirer. Il a fallu près de 40 minutes pour avoir notre assiette, et les assiettes sont arrivés à 10 minutes d'intervalle. La serveuse est venue nous voir seulement lors des commandes et aucun refil d'eau ou de café nous a été proposé.   Bref, je vous conseille tout de meme d'y aller ne serait-ce que pour leur bouffe, qui est excellente :) !"}
{"text":"L'attente pour manger à Montréal c'est normal. Donc 1h sous la pluie pour avoir une table (sans réservation) mais sans regret car c'était SUCCULENT! Le choix est large ainsi que le prix mais pour la qualité du service et des plats, ça vaut le coup de se faire plaisir. La boisson chaude est inclus, rien d'exceptionnel si vous prenez un café, il sera dégueu, préféré, selon moi, les chocolats chaud, thé ou jus pressée, ça aura plus de goût."}
{"text":"My new favorite brunch spot in town. Had the opportunity to go there last week-end. Despite the 30 minutes line-up, I decided to wait because I heard lots of good things about this place, plus it wasn't that cold :p. Anyway, service was perfect and the food was amazing and super tasty, i had the ufs pochés champêtre, the association of the different ingredients with its amazing porcini sauce made it exquisite. I'm putting 4 stars because this review is based on a single experience. We'll definitely go back soon and hopefully add the 5th star."}
{"text":"One thing the reviews don't cover is size... portions are huge! I had the amazing Croque Madam and could only finish 1/3 of it. It was delicious! It was crowded but plenty of room at the bar and outside. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Yeah...where do I start! This place is a must. 2 aspects: ambience and food. The restaurant is so adorable, very retro, very pleasing to the eye. Let's talk about the best part: the food!! So delicious! I had their foie gras egg Benedict and wow...blew my mind. Presentation was spectacular, served on a wooden tray. I judge restaurants, specifically brunch places on their poached eggs and this one did not disappoint one bit. We also indulge a bit and had their sugar crêpe, it was the cutest and sweetest thing we had in a long time. Few things to keep in mind, the price is a bit up there, for good reasons, it's great to get a group of friends out there and/or maybe on a splurge day (trust me, it's worth it). They have a patio, so come ready to enjoy the sun and if not, you still have indoors, also, it is located off the Beaudry metro, maybe 4 mins to get there?! With all that being said, please please please find your way there and enjoy a nice brunch with family, friends and/or yourself :)"}
{"text":"uf poché foie gras spectacular!! The grilled cheeses were also very good. The presentations are great. The fruits were good. The beignets with apple were also crispy outside, soft inside. All their plates seemed very good. I'm so going back. This is one of my new to go places."}
{"text":"This was an amazing brunch!! I ordered the plus que parfait which was fantastic - fried eggs on a bed of gnocchi, pancetta, and argula - plus a side of baguette, sliced fruit, and a mini smoothie. Great flavours and a huge portion, too! Loved the variety and found the gnocchi quite unique. I also had a decaf americano which was delicious, too. Can't wait to come back here when I'm next in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I returned here yesterday after a great meal 5 years ago. New location, very comfy. I ordered my favorite Benedict with Foie Gras. What arrived to the table was RUBBER. I was so focused on the company I was sharing the meal with that it didn't register at the time. But see the photo below please. It's appalling. And what's worse is that the waiter, the same one that was aggressively trying to up-sell me by adding an order of french toast then tried to tell me that this was the way it always looked. If that's the case then it's even worse. He and the chef and the expediter  should all know better. Shame on the management for allowing this to happen especially on a signature dish."}
{"text":"Best brunch ever. Legit. I've had loads of brunches joints in NYC, but this one might be the best one. The workers were really nice and friendly. The food came rather quick and the portions were no joke. I recommend coming early on the weekends (around 9am) or else you'll have to wait. There is a good amount of tables, but it'll fill up quick. Will def come back when I'm around in town."}
{"text":"Never disappointed every time I go. Food is always delicious with impeccable presentation.  Recommend to many people and none were disappointed.  Expect a wait of 45 mins."}
{"text":"Great view and local food. Amazing services and good location. Order duck egg will make your day!"}
{"text":"Oh my ! Un bonheur sans nom ... les gnocchis à la pancetta sont la nouvelle passion et le chai latte Est excellent, ce qui est plutôt rare !"}
{"text":"The food was awesome, very well seasoned and well presented. The only downside of this place is that it is fairly small and pretty popular, so you're probably going to have to wait in line if you get there after 11 (we had to wait outside when it was cold and snowing). The tables are also very close to each other which I didn't particularly like."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Came here for brunch with a bunch of friends. We didn't wait very long since it was only 10 am. We came just in time because the wait time. Was massive shortly afterwards. It was nice that they provided water and tea for those waiting.   We shared the duck confit grilled cheese and the smoked salmon bagel with pano encrusted avocado. Two thumbs up! Coffee was so so and the wait for the food was really long. Still worth it though! I'll be back."}
{"text":"We have been there a few time for lunch and it is one of the best place in Montreal to brunch! The wait could be really long, so just pick your time wisely as in...get there at the opening. However, it is worth the effort as everything we got there is just amazing. The decor is nice and the staff is really welcoming even when there is a lot of clients. For drink, we had an americano and a grapefruit fresh squeezed juice that were really good. For the food, we decided to go for a grilled cheese and oeuf benedicte au foie gras. Both were to die for. The cheese in the grilled cheese was generous and they are using Gaspor bacon. The foie gras was amazing as well as the bread in the oeuf benedicte plate. Definitly one of our favorite brunch spot in Montreal...we we get there before the crowd."}
{"text":"Jusqu'à présent, leur brunch est imbattable, à mon avis .   Soyez préparer à attendre de 15 à 45 mins pour le brunch, premier arriver premier servi. Il y a aussi un peu de confusion à l'entrée à savoir si on s'avance afin de donner notre nom ou si plutôt on reste dans la file, puisque qu'il n'y pas de personne attitré à cette tâche. Les serveurs, chacun leur tour prennent le relais, ce qui peut parfois être long avant d'être dirigé (La raison pour être un 4 étoiles et non 5).  On se retrouve dans un décors urbain sans prétention, mais tout de même avec une touche de design. Agréable pour les yeux. Le seul côté un peu négatif au niveau ambiance, c'est le bruit; l'ambiance peut devenir assez bruyant quand le restaurant est bondé et comme il l'est toujours pour les brunchs... Bien c'est pas mal toujours bruyant!  Dans une note plus positive, LE MENU!!! Vaste éventail qui plaira à tous les goûts. Mon met favoris, l'uf bénédictine au saumon fumé. Un délice! On a le choix de 1 ou 2 ufs pour les différents appétits. Voir la photo pour le contenu de l'assiette. Et comment passé à côté de leur fameux pain doré ... Il m'en faut une tranche à chaque fois, c'est inconditionnel!  En ce qui concerne le service, tel que mentionné plus tôt, il peut y avoir de la confusion à l'accueil. Toutefois, une fois à table, le service est jovial et rapide. Personnellement, je préfère le \"bar\", surtout quand je suis seule, les serveurs(euses) y sont très sympathiques et professionnels!   Voilà! Moi j'adore!"}
{"text":"When we entered the restaurant on a cold winter noon, we were told to wait outside, since most of the tables were taken. We ended up waiting 20 mintues, even though there were some open tables (or so it seemed). When we entered for the second time (after 20 minutes), another lady greeted us and wanted to put us on a waiting list - the one before didn't. After some explanation (misunderstanding) we were given a cute table in the back of the restaurant. We then waited another 5-10 minutes until we were able to order.  Ok, that put aside: the food was very DELICIOUS (poached egg on a brioche with foie gras, which came with a tiny bowl of fruits!), so evetually, it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is incredible and probably the best breakfast/brunch I've ever had. Ordered the apple fritters, bacon/cheese omlette, and a piece of French Toast. The apple fritters came with a caramel sauce that was so good, I couldn't get enough. I ended up putting it on the French Toast and probably should have drank the rest haha. So damn good. The French Toast was as advertised: crispy and delicious. The omlette was also unlike anything I've ever had, slightly crispy on the outside (from the cheese I think), and a fluffy, cheesy, bacony filling that was so incredible, I couldn't stop eating it. The home fried potatoes that came with the omlette was also really good, although needed a little salt. Can't wait to return to Montreal and this will be my first stop!"}
{"text":"I had wanted to try Le Passé composé for a while, so I decided I should go. Then I read Yelp reviews for 15 minutes, and decided I should hide at home, where food is a minute away, and, not, two full hours.  I panicked. I texted we should abort the mission, and since my fellow bruncher is calm and cool-headed, he decided we should try it out first, and retreat if needed be. By god he was right. We showed up at 1pm on a sunny Saturday and were seated in less than 10 minutes, praise be! The service is decent, the decor is Pinterest, and their terrace is more like a bunch of tables in a garden. Still, with a one-track mind, we both ordered \"Le dej'\" and it was delicious. It has it all: meat, egg - very good when scrambled, fruits - fresh, potatoes - soft and greasy, as well as a little scoop of beans and a tiny glass of cranberry coulis. That's delicious in itself. But you know what's good, so you'll order it with the french toast, which is made of brioche, and breaded with panko. I rolled my eyes forever at the reviews here, but I must admit they are well-deserved: that must have been one of the best slices of french toast I've eaten. I recommend eating it with the cranberry sauce.   There were some less cool things, like a ridiculously small quantity of maple syrup (how else am I gonna eat my ham?), or the fact that the bread doesn't come with butter. Or jam. Just like, slices of bread y'all. You won't care, you'll be tonsils-deep in french toast."}
{"text":"Repas ultra copieux. Goûteux. Mais service très long. Attente toute aussi longue pour avoir une table dû à la forte affluence. Prévoir parfois 45 min d'attente."}
{"text":"Pros: great atmosphere and decor, clean, helpful staff, delicious food, big portions, coffee was delicious, even though it was a full restaurant at 9:30 am, it didn't feel crowded.   Cons: pricey"}
{"text":"Came here with two buddies. Two of us got the poached gaspor (poached eggs on top of a potato souffle with peas and pork shoulder) served with fresh fruit and a shot of smoothie. Very good. We also ordered the apple donuts -- deep fried (like a beignet) served with two sauces for dipping. Very tastey.  To top it all off the coffee was good too! Would definitely recommend this spot to others in the future."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for brunch and both times the food was amazing. Well worth the long wait at the door. Their French toast is to die for and is both crispy and juicy plus not too sweet, which usually is what I dislike with toast. The foie gras Benedict was divine, and everyone else seemed to enjoy their versions of Benedict. Great and friendly staff, too."}
{"text":"The line is ridiculously long and the waiter said that its gonna be at least 2 hours of waiting time until we  could get a table!  I honestly don't understand why people would wait so long to get in - there are a hundred other better brunch places nearby that are much faster"}
{"text":"Premier essaie dans ce restaurant qui était à la base situé sur la rue Roy et qui a pris l'emplacement du Ma'tine. Je ne connaissais pas l'ancien Passé Composé, mais je peux dire que celui ci est très intéressant. Les choix de brunchs sont nombreux pouvant satisfaire différents goûts. Mon amie et moi avons pris le déjeuner du passé composé, le classique avec ses oeufs, viandes, fèves, patates et le choix de pain doré. Il semblerait que le pain doré soit un must et avec raison. Une portion généreuse d'un pain moelleux et en plus frit puis saupoudré de sucre. De quoi vous faire tomber de votre chaise. Le bord d'abord croustillant, puis le centre fondant en bouche. La terrasse est magnifique, on y joue de la musique, de quoi vous mettre dans une belle ambiance.  Pourquoi le 3 étoiles? En fait, ils perdent la majorité de leurs points sur le service. Je n'ai jamais vu dans une salle à capacité modeste un service aussi lent. Nous avons attendu nos plats plus de 40 minutes et tout ça pour une plat basique (pardon mais des oeufs et de la viande c'est pas bien compliqué). La serveuse nous a imposé du café filtre sans nous demander si nous préférions le thé (qui était superbement servi sur un large plateau de bois). La serveuse principale n'est jamais venu nous demander s'il nous fallait quoi que ce soit d'autre. Nous avons eu une 2e serveuse quant à elle plus amiable et à l'écoute. Je ne sais pas s'il manquait de l'effectif cette journée, mais j'ai été déçue. Je leur redonnerais une chance prochainement pour voir s'ils font mieux!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I feel like a prick for giving this place a 3 star, but I don't hate it! Don't take it the wrong way, yelpers. Go to this cute spot no matter what the reviews say. This place just was not my cup of tea but it might be yours.  I really do love eating brunch and I couldn't help myself when I saw all the delicious photos of this place. They plate their food, BEAUTIFULLY (this is what I'm obsessed with the most about this place). When I went on a Sunday, the service was slow, which I knew it would be, but I felt it was a bit too slow. It did take a while to get served and waiting for the food was a little longer than expected.   I personally felt the food looked way better than it tasted. I went with 3 other friends and I got to try a bit of all of their foods but it just did not wow me. I've thought of giving this place another try but I know I just didn't enjoy their food as much as I wanted :("}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast! The poached eggs are superb and the staff super friendly. The smoothie shot is delicious.  It gets crowded during brunch time so come in early.  Take the Green line to Beaudry."}
{"text":"Between the last time I wrote the 1st review and now, I've gone back multiple times knowing I'd have to wait (The trick is to have a little snack just before arriving so then your one hour wait in line and 45 mins wait at the table wont be as excruciating)  I won't go into details again about how great the food is here but let's just say that everytime, I came back with different people and they all loved their dishes.   I always go for the classic Passe Compose brunch & skip the bread or the duck confit and/or the lamb confit as they are the safe gluten-free friendly choices but you will see from my pictures that my fellow face-stuffers do not shy away from food (and nor should they!!!!)  The only thing I'm dreading is when the weather will get warmer, the wait will be even worse"}
{"text":"Best brunch in a while - even compared to the many spots in New York.  Table for 2 on a snowy day without reservations at 10am. No wait at all though the place was already relatively crowded.  Service was always attentive and friendly  The selection is great!   We ordered the grilled cheese with escargot (great crust with an amazing mushroom sauce) and duck confit poached eggs (fruit side was a welcome taste after a rather heavy Bene dish - eggs were perfect and the duck confit with sweet potato mash was great complement)  We also shared a side of Panko french toast - amazing! It's not traditional for sure but the crispy batter with the maple was a delight. Not to mention the soft Centre.   Overall a great brunch place and we'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"Upon entering Le Passe Compose, the first thing that caught my eye were these giant glasses of grapefruit juice that almost everyone seemed to order. I had to investigate the hype for myself and it was well worth it -- Their freshly squeezed grapefruit juice is served with crushed ice (the best kind for keeping your juice cold but not watered down). To eat, we shared two plates:   1. Lamb eggs benny with two eggs -- It was topped with a spiced hollandaise and a generous handful of kettle chips. The whole combination was just to die for. While the photo may make the benedict look a little overly saucy, it was actually the perfect amount. If you are ordering a benedict for yourself, I would recommend considering the one egg option. With the toppings, sauce and potential juices or sides you may order, the one egg is the ideal serving size.   2. Panko crusted French toast -- Two thick slices of white bread, perfectly light with that extra panko crunchiness, with real maple syrup on the side. Both plates were served with fresh fruit and a little smoothie on the side.   The service gets a little hectic when it is busy at Le Passe Compose but the food is impressive enough that it's worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Eggs benedict with style. We had ours with foie gras and it had a fruit salad on the side. Everything was perfectly cooked and glistening with oil and bechamel sauce. Yum. Best presentation on a brunch that we've had in Montreal."}
{"text":"Hands down amazing food; a lot of it was sourced right there in front of us too. But, this isn't one of those places that touts healthy food and in turn give up taste! Went here TWICE cause it was that good."}
{"text":"This is one of the top brunch places in town, I have been going to this restaurant for the last few years. I usually get the grill cheeses, they are amazing. They need to be prepared for an intense experience though. They are made to the perfection. The space is super nice, they have an amazing terrace during summer time. The service is not the best but not bad that you don't want to go back."}
{"text":"Le Passé Composé is the kind of place that you get excited about coming back to, before you've even finished your meal. Their duck confit-egg-squash-mix-up (not the official name) is without a doubt the best brunch I've had in months, and I've eaten more brunches in the past few months than I can count. Add in the phenomenal service, despite chaos in the kitchen and a huge line up, and you've got a recipe for one of the best brunch spots in Montreal."}
{"text":"After a yelp search and a long walk from our airbnb, we arrived in Le Passé Composé. We almost walked right past it because we didn't see it. (I expected a line out the door, since that was what I read on Yelp, but we were here off-season so I guess that's why).  We started off with Mimosas (duh!) and these were great, served with a little fruit skewer on top.   I ordered the waffles, they came out and it was a giant tower, brussels waffles size (but not the same texture) with about 2 apples worth of sauteed apple slices. Despite being intimidated because of the huge amount (I have a european size stomach...) it was delicious! It came with a yoghurt sauce and this made the whole dish taste amazing!  My mother had the poached egg with ratatouille and she finished the whole plate, which means it must have been really really REALLY good, since it is a rarity. My boyfriend had the deconstructed pancakes with panko fried banana and homemade nutella and he didn't complain either. I had a taste (because that's what boyfriends are for, right?) and I loved it!   And my brother had a grilled cheese with raclette cheese and this was also great, for those people who like savory breakfasts/brunches.  All in all I would for sure recommend this place if you want an instagram-worthy plate and are willing to splurge a little on brunch/breakfast."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5  This place is located on Boulevard de Maisonneuve E and Rue de la Visitation in The Gay Village. You will know you at the right place once you see a huge line outside this brunch spot. Paid street parking is available outside this place.   [SERVICE] - 5/5 Our server was friendly and efficient. Once we finished our main courses and 4 different servers gave us updates and ensured we would get our dessert promptly.   [DÉCOR] - 5/5  Rustic and small yet simple and clean.

[ORDER] - 4/5 - Passé Composé's Breakfast - $20.00: I ordered over easy eggs and they were cooked perfectly. Bacon, sausage, cooked ham on the bone were deliciously smoky. I tried creton (a pork spread) for the first time. I put it on my baguette and it was nice and savoury. French toast was life-changing! It was deliciously crisp on the outside and the sweet egg flavour soaked all the way inside the bread. Also comes with a mini smoothie and fresh fruit. -   - Smoked Salmon Poached Egg - $16.00: English muffin was deliciously topped with fresh slices of smoked salmon, and a creamy béarnaise sauce. Also comes with a mini smoothie and fresh fruit. This dish is very excellent, I would highly recommend it.   - Apple Beignets $9.00: I was slightly thrown off because I thought this would be a pastry but it was actually just deep-fried apple slices covered with dough. The ingredients were fresh, but I feel like the crisp apple and deep-fried dough did not complement one another too well.   [OVERALL] - 5/5  Definitely my favourite place for brunch. I really enjoyed the fresh Smoked Salmon Poached Egg and Passé Composé's Breakfast. Along with the ambiance, this place is the definition of \"good food, good company, and good times.\""}
{"text":"My first brunch in Montreal gave Toronto's brunch a serious run for its money!    I ordered the vegetarian omelet (pesto, aged cheddar and garlic) and it came with breakfast potatoes, fruit, toast and a mini dragon fruit juice (so cute) ... Everything tasted incredible!! The portions are HUGE ... I definitely could have split mine and still been stuffed.   A must go brunch spot in Montreal! Don't miss it :)"}
{"text":"Mon expérience brunch au Passé Composé de la rue Roy n'a pas été des plus fabuleuse. Comme j'avais déjeuné à la succursale de Saint-sauveur quelque temps avant et que j'avais apprécié l'excellent service ainsi que la qualité des assiettes, j'ai voulu renouveler l'expérience sur le plateau. Malheureusement c'était un essai/erreur car la succursale de la rue Roy n'avait rien avoir avec celle de Saint-sauveur. J'ai commandé la même chose au 2 endroits,mais à Montréal nous n'avons pas reçu nous plats au même moment, on a oublié le pain et les fruits n'étaient pas frais. Déception!"}
{"text":"the food is just ok, the servers are kind, but not worth the time standing in the line."}
{"text":"By far the best brunch place I have ever been to! I love their menu selections- it's so unique but they also have basic items such as omelets, pancakes and waffles if you're not feeling very adventurous.   I would 100% recommend trying their poached eggs options. We got the duck confit and the foie grass poached eggs. Both were absolutely delicious. I loved the mix of the duck confit with butternut squash topped with waffle chips. I was very satisfied with the 1 egg option! Both care with a side of fresh fruit and a mango dipping sauce. The portions were perfect to leave me full but not stuffed- it was a perfectly balanced dish.   To satisfy our sweet tooth, we got the apple beignet. It came with fresh strawberries dusted in powdered sugar with sides of caramel and yogurt dipping sauces. These were so yummy! The apples were soft but not soggy and it went great with the caramel.   On top of the delicious food, everything is so picture worthy! The food was plated beautifully. We also got amazing service. Definitely would come back the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Nice place but there is no point to spend an hour in a line. Food is average, presentation is good. Drinks are extremely horrible, they don't know how to make drinks. I don't think I will come there again."}
{"text":"It was my first visit since they moved to this new location (which was previously Ma'tine). So far the food is still as good as I remember. We sat outside on their terrasse so we could enjoy the sun and their little garden where they planted some vegetables.   I had the poached egg champêtre (brioche bread filled with fried oyster and mini shiitake mushrooms, and smoked piglet shoulder accented with porcini sauce). It was served with a shot of smoothie and a side of fresh fruits. Their dishes are quite generous and the price is affordable as well.   The service was good in general. Kid friendly since they have baby chairs. They offer brunch all week, which is pretty great since there aren't many other places doing that."}
{"text":"Autant que je voulais adorer Le Passé Composé, mon expérience a été un peu gâchée par la lenteur du service: que ce soit pour recevoir mon café ou pour payer, l'attente était assez longue. C'est dommage parce que, même si le menu proposé pour le brunch est assez restreint et que les prix sont légèrement élevés, les plats sont originaux (y compris les omelettes!) et délicieux. Le décor est très agréable et dans l'ère du temps: meubles en bois, petites ampoules accrochées au plafond, tête de cerf au mur, etc. Par contre, l'endroit est assez bruyant (ce qui peut être assez agressant un dimanche matin!). Bref, Le Passé Composé est à essayer si vous êtes dans le coin: mais prévoyez un peu plus de temps qu'à l'habitude. Au passage, le menu affiché sur le site web n'est pas le même que celui qui est disponible sur place (en fait, il manque beaucoup de plats). Il n'y a que peu d'options végétariennes."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, i had the double egg, foie gras benedict. The eggs were perfectly poached, the Brioche bread was soft and nicely toasted, foie gras was nicely seared, and lastly the foie gras sauce was velvety and tasty.  I really appreciated the food, everything was well seasoned, and tasty. The restaurant is very comfortable, and welcoming.  Defiantly will be back."}
{"text":"Bon restaurant à déjeuner. Un peu dispendieux par contre. Belle ambiance. Super belle déco. La semaine, c'est tranquille. Mais la fin de semaine, attention. Soyez près à attendre. Si vous aimez le pain doré ou les déjeuner sucrés, le pain dore panko. À essayer absolument! Délicieux !!"}
{"text":"Très bon déjeuner, belle présentation des plats + belle décoration du resto. Essayez, tout est délicieux !"}
{"text":"I came for brunch when I was visiting Montreal this past January. I ordered the foie gras eggs Benedict and it was DELICIOUS! I'm posting this review now because I still can't stop thinking about it and it has almost been a year. Also, can we just appreciate how beautiful every dish looks? I'm thinking of flying back for a day just so I can try it again."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this lovely bistro! Very nice terrace and perfect for weekend brunch. They have a two pages menu, the front page is the more \"artsy\" and special breakfast choices with quite exotic ingredients and flavours, whereas the back page is the more traditional and can't-go-wrong brunch choices. They really prepare their food with care and the plating was mesmerizingly beautiful. Simply in love!"}
{"text":"Dans la liste de mes meilleures places de brunch a Montreal, le Passé-composé est indéniablement sur le podium.  Chacun des plats proposés sont gargantuesques et savoureux. Le menu est très varié, avec un grand choix d'ufs pochés dont un au foie gras poêlé à se damner. Le croque-madame est aussi large que haut : je défies quiconque d'être capable de finir son assiette !  Comme sa comparse Régine, Le Passé-composé est pris d'assaut les fins de semaine, et parfois le line-up s'étend en semaine : attendez-vous à patienter ! Mais une fois installé le service est hyper rapide et toujours très agréable."}
{"text":"If you want to impress your parents or just indulge in a breakfast spectacle then  Le Passé Composé is the place to go. They recently moved ...the new looks is way more clean and modern aesthetic there as the old location was a more homey feel.   The only problem with this place is that you might have to go back to bed afterwards and sleep it off.   I've had most of the items on the menu and nothing is bad, but here is the underdog that a waiter once enlightened us with: two sandwiches that get over looked: The Grilled Cheese Gaspor and The Innovative Grilled Cheese. My fiance and i now order a Croque-Madame or one of the Poached Egg dishes and split it with one of the Grilled Cheeses, trust me you will not be disappointed!   The hours are super limited. So this is not a recommended Sat or Sun brunch its so crowded and you have to be there early. What i recommend is if possible go on a weekday."}
{"text":"Un très bon brunch (un peu cher tout de même), rien a dire sur les assiettes qui étaient excellentes. Mais le repas a complètement été gaché par un mauvais service, des serveuses qui tirent la gueule, qui ne disent pas bonjour, qui jettent les menu sur les tables, qui nous pressent pour récupérer les assiettes et bien entendu qui ne disent pas au revoir... C'est vraiment dommage, c'est pour cela que je ne mettrai qu'une étoile !  Je n'y retournerai pas à cause de cette mauvais ambiance !"}
{"text":"OMG. Recommended by a shopkeeper in downtown and it must be one of the top 5 brunches of all time. I had the eggs with meat and it came with French toast, beans, toast, fruit and nothing was disappointing. Had to wait about 40 minutes but well worth the wait. Bloody Mary was excellent too. Menu is multiple pages in French and English. You will find something you like. Staff was friendly and attentive, and kitchen fast enough to allow for good conversation. I may come back to Montreal just for this place."}
{"text":"La file d'attente est longue en fin de semaine entre 45 min et 1h30 pour avoir une table. Nous avons tenté notre change à plusieurs reprises pour enfin obtenir une table.Les plats proposés pour le brunch sortent de l'ordinaire avec une belle élaboration. La nourriture est de bonne qualité, avec une étoile supplémentaire pour les oeufs pochés foie gras qui sont d'un gout exquis."}
{"text":"first i liked the waiting list system where they call you on the cell phone when the table is ready plus free coffee while waiting it made the 30mins go fast. i had the foie gras poched eggs, the hollandaise sauce was great, the bread was ok i am gluten intolerant and they don't have the gluten free version, so the foie gras was perfectly seared but again i try to eat less foie gras because it's so unethical but the waitress recommended, we ordered the apple donuts for the table omg my jar dropped the maple dipping sauce was Delicious with the wipped cream. my friend had the ham posched eggs which was ok, and another had the pulled duck grilled cheese which was yummy. they are moving to another location which i am unhappy about since they were so close to me! now need to find another great place on plateau to satisfy my post workout feast on the weekend =.="}
{"text":"Je dois avouer qu'à mon arrivée, et après une inspection du menu, je trouvais que cet endroit était pas mal cher pour le petit déjeuner. Difficile de trouver quoi que ça soit pour moins de $10-12. J'étais prête à donner une étoile de moins juste pour le prix, mais quand mon assiette est arrivée, j'ai tout de suite compris pourquoi les autres avis rendaient tous éloge à ce  bistro de quartier.  C'est un resto un peu caché des grandes rues occupées du Plateau, donc ça permet à l'endroit d'être bien tranquille et super relaxant. Le genre de place où je retournerais pour un brunch spécial (pour un anniversaire, une célébration d'une victoire, etc.) J'avais commandé un simple 2 oeufs bacon qui m'a été servi avec une superbe brochette de fruits en plus de pleins d'autres petits fruits frais (mûres, framboises, fraises), même si on était déjà dans les journées froides d'hiver. Au lieu de toast, on m'a donnée une baguette qui était moelleuse en dedans et croustillante à l'extérieur. Et ma tasse de café a été remplie assez régulièrement - je ne me souviens même pas d'y avoir vu le fond! Tout ce qu'il faut pour un bon déjeuner remplissant et une belle surprise pour débuter la journée du bon pied!"}
{"text":"Worth the 1hr lineup on the weekends.one of the best brunch in montreal.hands down the best french toast you will ever have,please don't miss out on it when you go.if you can, try to go during weekdays to avoid the lineup."}
{"text":"This is where you come to find something new! Not new as in new food or exotic stuff but new as in new tastes through different ways of making some dishes. Every plate is made with observable detail. It looks and smells and tastes fancy. For example, my poutine was a blue cheese poutine, one of a kind, perfection! Not for everybody though! Choose what you like! The staff is ok. Could smile a bit more! My overall experience was good, not enough to say great."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a lovely little restaurant. Might be a little bit hard to spot on the outside since it looks so dark and is a little bit small. Try coming at non-peak hours because it gets full fast.  FOOD: Portions are a little bit smaller than the usual brunch spot but the quality is very good. Everything is made with care and tastes delicious. They know how and what to pair with different foods to make sure that the flavours complement each other well.  PRICE: Price was a little bit more pricey than other brunch places but considering the quality that you are getting, it is worth it.   SERVICE: Service was good. Although it was a bit slow, the staff was friendly and seemed happy to serve us."}
{"text":"Le Passe Compose is a great place for Brunch. I had the Duck Confit Poached Egg. The eggs were perfectly prepared with runny yolks, sat on top of savory butternut squash and were topped with tender duck, white Porto sauce, and crisp potato waffles. The cappuccino was also very nice."}
{"text":"I had the classic meals both times I went there. Sooo delicious!! And the coffee.... out of this world! Crazy lineup though on weekends."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this restaurant. It's a great place for a date , family bunch or even a meal alone. The staff are very friendly and speak both French and English. The food was amazing. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I'm really impressed with this place compared to my last visit at \"Ma'tine\", the previous owner of the space:  1. The coffee is now refill-able and the server actually comes say hi within 5-15min to take your order.  2. The lineup is still huge but at 10:30am, it was still easy to find a table for 2.   3. On the variety side, the menu is now 3-page long with choices as creative as before.  4. The taste - grilled cheese with canard confit / pulled pork - are both beyond 4 star!  What I don't understand is the sauce. The grilled cheese is flavorful enough and they have an extra bowl of bbq sauce for it. The salad is seasoned but they put a range sauce at a side. Also, they threw extra range sauce on top of pickled cabbage that's already good by itself. If you're a light eater, ask to put all those fatty sauce at the side or order something less heavy than grilled cheese (if that exists here! lol)."}
{"text":"Food was interesting - not just your usual egg options. I had a special of poached eggs, with smoked trout, capsicum, hollandaise, and courgette flower fritters on brioche. Was a bit too heavy and rich for me, but was tasty. Came with a side of fruit - which I thought was a good touch. Coffee was ordinary. Service was good for a busy restaurant. Would recommend if you want a very hearty breakfast."}
{"text":"A must-go brunch place at Montreal. Food is awesome, large quantity and great combination of ingredients. Coffee, the coffee here were amazing!! I ordered two cappuccino in a row, and one espresso yesterday, have been really missing it since then and planning to go back just to get the coffee, as I have no time to wait in line again"}
{"text":"Checked out this place today for the first time with my brunch buddy. I'd heard so much about it so my expectations were quite high. We waited 45 mins to get a table, and about half an hour to get our food.. I got the duck confit poached egg, it was tasty and the presentation was nice also. I found it not worth the price though, it was $18 for one egg and even coffee was not included (extra $2.25 for coffee- regular price). I think it's a nice place to try once, but I find it too noisy and expensive and not really worth the wait. I don't think I'm going back."}
