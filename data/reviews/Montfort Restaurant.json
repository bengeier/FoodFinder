{"text":"So it's nothing spectacular but when I'm in the burbs I will never pass up an invite for Montfort's lunch or dinner.  I usually get the Montfort Chicken pita, basically shawarma with some pineapple in the mix shoved into a warm pita with lettuce and tomato. They give you complimentary sauces, one garlic and one onion chutney, both equally delicious and should definitely be poured generously into your sandwich.   I've had salads before, as well as the falafel and the plain shawarma pitas and it's all very good. They are nice people at this location also, been there a long time."}
{"text":"Fine Mediterranean cuisine!  The chicken sharwma is especially good. They don't have posted hours but you can always count on them to be open late, usually until 2am during the week and 4am over the weekend."}
{"text":"We went for weekend lunch, pretty good food.  However I couldn't give higher rating because the seating and environment wasn't too comfortable, just ok for a lunch.  The service is good, but only 1 server so he was super busy..."}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience at this place. My husband picked up some food which was very cold and actually quite disgusting. The fries were gross. It was so bad that it's the first time we ever drove back to a place to get our money back. They did offer to give us coupons and exchange the food, but I'm not one for complaining when it comes to food and then getting it remade. I wouldn't go back to this place but I have tried other locations and they were quite good."}
{"text":"We decided to go Montfort for dinner. We hadn't been there for over a year and we remembered how good the food was.  I emphasize \"was\" because it was not what we expected.    We arrived at the Restaurant and there were maybe 2 other patrons there. We ordered hummus as an appetizer, it seemed like it came out of a container.  The presentation was not much a couple of sliced cucumbers was about it. There was no oil or paprika to garnish it. The hummus was just plopped onto a plate, and it seemed kind of off, it had a sort of acidic taste. The pitas were also stale.  My husband ordered a side of fries. To say they were overcooked would be an understatement.  They were so dry and crisp, as my husband said \"I felt like I was eating hickory sticks\". The waitress forgot that my husband ordered the shwarma. We had to repeat the order to her.    I ordered the pork souvlaki with fries and salad. My fries were okay and the souvlaki was good, but I had to ask for salad dressing for my salad.  I don't think that we'll be going back again, which is too bad because Montfort used to be such a good restaurant.  I hope they read these reviews so that they can improve their restaurant to what it used to be."}
{"text":"The food is really tasty, no denying that.  Staff is somewhat indifferent. But something confuses me about wthis place. For a cusine that relies so heaily on garlic, why does there seem to be so many kids there on dates? Just doesn't seem like a wise choice."}
{"text":"A guy that we had doing some electrical work recommended this place.  We figured that if he was willing to drive from Markham to Mississauga that this place would be worth it!  And it was.   We got the appetizer that allowed for a selection of 3 items from a list some very hard choices.  We settled on the humus with meat, the tabouleh, calamari.  All were ample portions but we could have used a few more calamari pieces.    When we go, we always get the meat platter since it has the most kinds of meat on it.  All of them are done brilliantly, the chicken, the beef and lamb are done to perfection.  The thing that keeps me coming back though is their garlic sauce.  Creamy and just the right amount of garlic gives that perfectly grilled meat that zing that will having me coming back for more.    I would have to agree with Ness though.  The place isn't really the most inviting environment and definitely not a place to bring someone if you are trying to make a good 1st impression. hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Really good restaurant. Definitely 5 stars always come here when I'm in the area and im never disappointed. Service is top notch and the food is great. Had the seafood dinner plate, chicken shawarma, and the bread with the dip. Thinking about it right now makes me hungry lol"}
{"text":"We used to go regularly until my son got very sick on the food one evening. Never been back. I find its overrated and the staff are disinterested."}
{"text":"We tried monfort many times, each time to be more disappointing than the previous time. We have noiw given up. Overpriced! Small shawarma plate for $16? Pure robbery! Tabouli salad for $8 half of which is iceberg lettuce for filler? Insane. Restaurant is always empty, slow service whether you dine in or do take out. Shawarma is, not fresh, fatty and overcooked. Just an insult to middle eastern cooking. I guess we will have to drive to Paramount in Mississauga from now on."}
{"text":"I drive by here every day, and want it to be good, but every time I go I'm always disappointed. The food looks like it would be good, but seems to miss the mark. You can get better pitas at the grocery store, the hummus isn't as good as summer fresh, the meat does the job but is typically dried out and lacks flavour while the fries are often a bit stale. You get lots of food and the prices are low, the people there are clearly trying hard, but food quality just isn't good enough to make me come back more than a couple times a year."}
{"text":"My dad ate at this place with a friend and recommended we try it out. It's located in a sketchy area and the interior is a bit outdated, however, the food was beyond my expectations.   We ordered the baba ganoush for our appetizer with warm pita bread on the side and it was delicious! I ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner, which comes with chicken souvlaki, yellow rice (side of your choice), pita bread and salad. In my opinion, their serving sizes are huge! Although, it came with one skewer of chicken for such a huge plate, the taste was amazing! My dad and my sister's boyfriend ordered the steak and shrimp dinner, which they really enjoyed as well.   The waitress was very polite and accommodating. She brought a delightful white garlic sauce and spiced onion condiment for each of us, which we happily ate alongside our meal.  Although the appearance of the place was a turn off for me in the beginning, I would definitely come back for a meal and recommend it to my friends!  If you can look past the unappealing interior and location, you should give it a try."}
{"text":"I usually like this place .... nothing super fancy or over the top great but consistent. So I called in a pickup for the mixed grill for 1 with no pineapple chicken. When I got there they had given me the deluxe mixed grill... more expensive by about 5$ and I pointed it out to them but when I was in a hurry so I took it. When I got home they had given me all pineapple chicken, not none. I called back and when I pointed this out to them they argued with me on both points and told me no, I had clearly ordered something I hate??? I continued to argue with her and she told me to speak to the cook on the phone. I just hung up. The cook didn't take my order which was messed up 2x, the woman answering the phone did. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"You know the next door place with a shady door in the ghetto part of town that somehow makes the best food?   this is that place.  The place is small with a long table right at the front (facing the kitchen) and 4 booths on the opposite side of the room. Then a random scattered table/chair pairs to fill the place up. The design looks like they were hand me downs from several people. You have a Victorian painting that you try relating to everything else but then you find nick knacks that don't make any sense. It's as though an explosion went out at an episode of hoarders and things just stuck in corners. It's not that it's crowded, Visually it just does not make sense.  The staff is almost always some polish/eastern European girl and an Arab guy (kitchen) - making this place even more nonsensical.   The location is connected to a strip of little bazaars right off of Hurontario so beware of the traffic here. The parking lot is shared with the rest of the stores so there is always plenty of parking available.  It never gets too busy for lunch but definitely busy in the evenings/weekends.   The service is good if you know what you want. Otherwise it's at minimum to nothing. They serve beer and fruit drinks that are worth a try. I've tried the Mango and the Pear drinks. Nothing like the real stuff but not the worst.   Now the food is just above expectation here. Aside from the fee garnishing sauces that are the first things served on your table, the meal portions are massive.  But I must go back to the free garnishes , because truthfully, this is why I come here. It's a small plate with 3 sauce cups. 2 garlic and 1 tomato/herb/diced onion. The garlic sauce  is a garlic lovers dream. The consistency is just the right mix of saucy enough to mix with your rice and thick enough to use for dipping. It's a yogurt base but the garlic taste is dominant. The tomato sauce mixed with herbs and diced onion is really a nice touch on any of the dishes. It's scary how  heavenly these sauces are. And this is just the beginning. It's so scary, I can ask for pita bread and just spread the onion/tomato sauce, then some garlic and call it a meal. It's THAT good.  1 plate dish comes with any 2  sides (rice and salad is usually my vice) and they bring you the meat on the bed of rice with 2 slices of pita on the side. The rice is usually garnished with fresh parsley , which just stimulates all my senses. I cannot tell you how much I enjoy the smell of fresh parsley. I am that person at the vegetable isle squeezing the avocado to find the 'just' right one, the one smelling the parsley before bagging to make sure it's organic and fresh. So, fresh parsley, to me, is a sign of good rotation of produce.   You can easily share 1 plate dish with an app and still be full. It's excellent for sharing with big groups or an intimate dinner.  The prices aren't as cheap but you pay for quality and I always have left overs to take home.  my  2 cokes kafta plate with rice -.  chicken souvlaki plate with rice hummus with pita =$42.00  not so fun fact: I highly discourage using the bathrooms here. They are run down and since this place is open wee late, the customers tend to get dodgier as the evening falls. So, with that sort of traffic, bathrooms are not recommended.    xoxo M."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING FROM RAW/BLOODY CHICKEN from Montfort Restaurant at 376 Iroquois Shore Rd, Oakville, ON. I would give this restaurant 0 out of 5 stars if I could. My MontFort Chicken Pita's chicken was bloody and raw like gelatine on the inside, which I unfortunately only realized after eating one piece piece. Upon leaving the restaurant, the chef not only denied that the chicken was not cooked but also stated that that is how chicken should taste. I received no apology from the chef or management and there was no responsibility taken by the chef or management. After speaking to the manager on the phone the following day, they assured us once again that we are wrong and that my sickness was only a coincidence. They then got hostile when we stated that we would leave reviews online on both Yelp, and Google. I would recommend Montfort if you enjoy a total disregard to customer satisfaction, enjoy being told you are wrong when employees are at fault, and enjoy spending the next day in bed next to a bucket."}
{"text":"Yesterday I wait around 15 in front of the cashier  I was expecting to be atended, I tried to order something to take home but all the personal was attended the uber eats, I was asked a few times if I needed something but they never took me seriously. Really like this place, the food is good but the service is very poor. Hope you guys do something to be better."}
{"text":"Food was disaster owner was rude  They has fruit flys will not be going back there ever again would of rather spent my money at McDonald's"}
{"text":"Their chicken Shawarma is soo good and at such a good price.  I have had a few issues with flat beer but the staff has always been extremely accommodating, so it is not such a big deal."}
{"text":"The lamb is luscious (literally!, not just as an alliteration, though i do tend to use many) even when cooked to medium-well (yes, medium-well!). The cubes of lamb are perfectly seasoned with oregano (for sure) and some other spices that I could only offer as a guess. Neither gamey, nor masked in flavour.  My dining companion and I had two side dishes with the lamb. Although I can't remember the first, the second was a green salad of sorts with crisp and seasoned, torn pieces of bread - sort of like croutons, but not. Really, only these crouton-like things stood out on the weak salad, which was not unlike those served with burgers at fast-food places. Our platter of appetizers was good, but definitely outdone by the lamb. Among the components we chose to make up the combo app. platter, the best was probably the hummus topped with chicken shawarma meat and the \"other eggplant dip\" (not creamy like baba ghanoush and with visibly mushed eggplant). The other two items (four total) aren't really worth writing about.  In sum (sorry, sometimes i blabber): Get LAMB.  Though the lamb alone is worth five stars, the dining setting also contributes to the average three star rating I've submitted. Had someone brought home some take-out from Montfort, I likely would have given it 4 stars (lamb is not so good once it cools). But, even pick-up warrants only 3 stars because you still have to step foot in there.  More blabber (be forewarned): Monfort makes a feeble attempt to draw diners with its ambiance. That's for sure. First, there's the crappy, plastic-chaired patio along a strip mall, which happens to look out on a bunch of parked cars and grey, dusty, busy intersection. Everything about this joint screams dingy, dive bar. Even then, the open-kitchen, typical of many shawarma slinging set-ups, did not calm my fears of going hungry as I imagined dry shards of tasteless meat on stale pitas served with thrice-fried potato wedges and beer.   turn a blind-eye to the ambiance and focus on the lamb"}
{"text":"This place is in the perfect location to get to for a quick lunch during the work week, so I find myself there quite frequently.  The restaurant is in a strip mall between a couple other food places.  And the inside is quite nice...  The service here can be touch and go.  Usually, it's fine - you order food and it comes in good order.  However, sometimes you can feel a little abandoned and wonder if you'll ever see your food...  Nonetheless, the food completely makes up for any service problems.  This is the place that made me rethink my opinion of Mediterranean food.  Everything I've ordered on this menu has been delicious. And for the price, you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is good!  I always either order the chicken shawarma pita and a small Greek salad or the chicken shawarma platter with double Greek salad....which also comes with pita. I know, I'm so daring when it comes to my food choices.   The garlic sauce is really good. I put that ish on everything. The fries are amazing. Right now you're thinking \"Whhhhhat?! Fries at Montfort?! No way!\" Way. Trust me, try them. You wont regret it. They are the perfect amount of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I steal my friend's fries all of the time. She loves me anyways.   I really like the chicken, obviously. Sometimes it can be a little dry, but nothing the garlic sauce can't fix. The portions are large, I always leave feeling full. What I really like is that when I order the pita, they don't stuff a bunch of lettuce at the bottom to make it look like there is lots of chicken. It's actually all chicken - the way it should be done.   The restaurant is clean and the service is great. No matter how much time goes by, one server always remembers me no matter what. She even commented on my hair cut last time and that she liked my darker hair. How do you remember these things you sweet, sweet woman?! It's a nice touch though and makes me feel like my business is valued.   Overall I have never had a bad experience when dining in at this restaurant. A few times when I have ordered take out they have given me the wrong meals altogether and it's a little far from my house to go back and get it switched out. For that reason they lost a star.   I will definitely continue to dine in at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ever since my first visit here last year, this has become one of my regular dinner stops when I come to the area. They are open very late, which is why I came here the first time (after a late flight). Now I come because of the Lamb Shashnik. It's lamb grilled with onions and peppers, in a pita, served with a couple of sauces that are very tasty. Only 8 bucks, too! Except for the pitas, the rest of the menu is a little pricey. The pitas are filling and taste good... a great bargain. My only disappointment on this visit is that they were out of five of the six beers they have on tap."}
{"text":"I first started going to this location regularly over 10 years ago.  From what I recall they really do have Mississauga's best falafel and the 2 signature sauces which were really tasty, will always be something I think about when going to out to any other Mediterranean restaurant.  It really does make them distinct and unique  I started going to the Hurontario/ Bristol location a few years ago because its closer, but unfortunately they have closed."}
{"text":"Friday night dinner spot...  Mixed grill special and lamb souvlaki.  Both come with choice of soup or salad and rice or potatoes.  I think the food has improved since the last time I came here.  Hummus appetizer with warm pita was tasty.  The lamb was tender and cooked perfectly, lentil soup was delish with a squeeze of lemon, and the mixed grill plate was also good.  Service was friendly and quick.    Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This has been a staple for me and my friends for years, especially when we're craving something late at night - they're open until 3 or 4 in the morning every day. The most common item we order is the chicken shawarma. On its own it is relatively simple - just a pita stuffed full with their marinated chicken and lettuce - but the sauces that come with it for you to add in (garlic and onion) are amazing. And they have no problem bringing you some more if you run out.  The quality of the food has always been great, and the portion sizes are more than enough to fill you up. The only downside is that the shawarma used to be about $7, which was really good value for money, but it seems like they have recently made a new menu and prices have gone up a couple dollars across the board. However, the quality hasn't changed, the service is pretty good, and the food is brought out quickly.  Other items I would recommend are the falafel, Montfort chicken and the lamb shashlik. I haven't had any of the dessert items but I've heard their red velvet cupcakes are great!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for Mediterranean food.   ordered the Montfort chicken with rice and salad instead of pita and salad.   A colleague ordered beef kefta and it is tender and fresh.   Service is good."}
{"text":"I think it is a matter of taste but we just like Agabi better. He cooks with ingredients that taste more fresh, his food is less greasy and he uses spice that burst with flavor. Montfort is certainly not bad, but second best across the board, not as creative with taste. On the plus side they are open on Sunday on the minus side, their online ordering system does not work half the time. Good when one is in need of a shawarma on Sunday but any other day go Agabi."}
{"text":"The signature Montfort Chicken Sandwich has got to be the most popular item here. It's great. It comes with two mouthwatering dips, one garlic and one tomato/onion based, which complement the sandwich perfectly. The calamari isn't bad either.  If the restaurant had one downfall, it'd be the slowness of the service. It consistently takes over 20 mins for me to receive my meal, whether I'm there for dine-in or takeout.   TL;DR - Great food, slow service, order the Montfort Chicken"}
{"text":"This is by far the most amazing place. It's the definition of a hidden gem. Please do not judge the book by its cover. The food is so incredible I wish I could eat it daily. However, I live in Vaughan and it's quite the drive. I try to have dinner here at least once a week. Must try: Chicken Shawarma Plate! Get the rice, chicken, salad and white sauce. The best shawarma I have ever tried. Ever. My mouth is watering just writing this post. Go. Now."}
{"text":"Overall, I feel fairly neutral about Montfort. Positives are the food was above average, the chicken was good could have had a little more flavour but not bad. The side dishes were all average or better, tried the fries, garden salad, and rice. The sauces were a bit off, the garlicy sauce especially was kind of watery. The chicken shawarma special seemed expensive compared to the chicken pita, around $10 more for sides a little more chicken. Had takeout so service was not a huge factor, I did however have to wait 15 more minutes than I was told on the phone."}
{"text":"The classic Montfort. I think this place has been around since the late 80's? because I remember, half remember rolling in at 2pm for a quick Montfort chicken. This place has the best creamy garlic sauce, wow. Now double the size from the wayback original resto. Can't beat the food, and the staff are funny & friendly. I think they are still open late. Definate reco. Right of the QEW @ trafalgar, for those passing through. My wife is addicted to the food now. So we'll have to be back once a month. Kid friendly, even with 7 month olds. lol."}
{"text":"Montforts been a weekly lunch destination with my coworkers and for a good reason. The lunch menu is reasonably priced and the food comes out quick(5-8 mins max).   I usually order the chicken shawarma plate which comes with chicken, rice, garden salad, naan, and the sauces youd expect like garlic, hot sauce. My favourite accompaniment is the onions in olive oil? They add a unique flavour and reallly elevate the dishes there.   Overall if you're looking for a quick bite for your lunch break, montforts a great option."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch yesterday, it's been at least 10 years since me and friends use to stop by this place late night after the bar ..I was impressed to the max , the server was so friendly,  food was served literally about a minute after my order was placed unavailable service. I ordered the montfort chicken pita and it was as wonderful as it was 10 years ago just amazing this place still has top notch food and top notch service , price is also reasonable...highly recommended."}
{"text":"After being away for 2 years Rebecca has taken over the ownership of monfort's again she has done Renovations into the restaurant and the quality of food is back to the highest quality before she left.  I met a friend there and was so happy to see Rebecca back at the restaurant I had Montfort chicken shawarma sandwich and baba ganoush it was excellent.  I would highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Great food, fresh pita bread!  Staff are very pleasant. Prices are reasonable.  Neigbourhood is sketchy, so you must ignore the outside weirdos."}
{"text":"I was craving chicken shawarma and was starving! I expected to get a normal size pita wrap but ended up with a small pita. Don't get me wrong the flavors are there and food is great but disappointed with the portion size and the pita wasn't wrapped or big enough to hold the chicken and everything just fell out of the pita and I had to eat it with a fork.  I was looking forward to a nice big wrapped sandwich.   Staff is super friendly. The waitress is the sweetest lady!"}
{"text":"So far I've only come here for late night takeout, but it looks like a lovely place to sit in with the tasteful music and dimmed lights, but it's not moody because the wait staff is so pleasant and cheerful.  The food is interesting in which they have middle eastern and Mediterranean options that I haven't had before, so picking what to eat is fun. The overall textures of the food are often chewy and very flavorful with their spices, so come hungry."}
{"text":"Montfort was a regular stop for me way back when I was in high school. I've long since moved far, far away from Oakville, but yesterday I was out for a ride and decided I'd stop in to see how it's doing.  Years ago when they moved down the plaza from the original location (which is now a sushi place) and expanded massively, I wondered how they'd handle it. Just fine, it turned out.  I debated having mixed grill (pro tip: don't ever order mixed grill for one if you're solo. It will feed two people. Mixed grill for two will feed four), but instead went with mezze and a Montfort Chicken sandwich. The original, the classic, that which I always got back in the day.  As good as ever. Seasoned chicken, a hint of bacon, and pineapple in a pita, to be slathered as you wish with a creamy garlic sauce and curried onions which is brought out on the side.   The staff have all changed from what I remember but the product hasn't."}
{"text":"This place should be featured on Gordon Ramsay's kitchen nightmares. Firstly, the pricing doesn't make sense. My buddy wanted the Montfort chicken on a bun instead of a pita and there was a $4 up charge. He actually ordered the super sandwich but changed the bread, thinking that it came with fries, but they up charged him $3.50 for the side dish of fries. So he paid $7.50 extra for a bun.   About those fries - disgusting. Low grade quality fries.   Montfort chicken - previously cooked, warmed up on the grill, rubbery, stringy and not tasty. They throw pineapple in the mix which makes it even more disgusting.   Salad - lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers covered in green slop.   If the prices were half the price then it would justify the food. I've eaten at some great Mediterranean restaurants and this place to be honest is the equivalent of a Wimpy's diner.   The place, which I was opposed to going to for the record, looked like a local hang out for people who admire cheap beer. There was an ever steady flow of shady characters popping in for a cheap beer.   I'd never eat here again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I used to come here years ago and it was pretty decent for both quality and value. Now OMG! Disgusting reheated chicken pita that tastes like your eating cardboard and calamari that even captain hi lander would turn in his grave at.  They tried to mask it with even more disgusting dipping sauce. The only good part of this meal was that I preordered it and it was ready by the time I got there. Oh yeah the place really needs a restaurant make over and I would first start my firing the chef.  I had to b line to McDonald's because I was so hungry after this unacceptable meal."}
{"text":"This place used to be so good. I found the staff inattentive.  When I ordered a Montfort chicken sandwich I was given something else. The server argued that I she was right. I've been going to Montforts since 2001. I always order the same thing. I don't even open the menu. Then we were forgotten and had to get up to find someone. So sad because they were really good for a long  time."}
{"text":"It's always a solid value for the money. Shawarma is somewhat westernized but still delicious."}
{"text":"This is great little restaurant. We used to be regulars & now we've returned. We had the Mazza for 2 & it was great. The sauces were amazing & the flavour profile was superb. Had a bowl of the house made lentil soup which was beauty as well. Our server was so polite & attentive & was terrific at looking after us. We talked about her home country & she gave us a little complimentary baklava for dessert. This was a great meal with solid service & was reasonably priced. A definite do-over."}
{"text":"Checked this place out after a long day of shopping.  Ordered take out food chicken wrap and a chicken on the rocks.  The food is alright they don't enough sauce but they also include a tomato/onion side. The chicken wrap was really small compared to other places.  Better than Paramount franchise but not better tham the other places around the city.  Price wise you can find better.  I will try again to see their other good options on the fence so far"}
{"text":"Great swarma 100%. the service at times is slow and getting your bill promptly generally does not happen. I used to love it here until a girl u once was seeing started working there. Since then she enjoys to cause drama within the restraint. The food is great even though I choose to stat away from there. When she gets fired I will go back 100%. ahaha"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to go out for a date to Montfort to try it out, the menu had some interesting looking options. I decided on a burger with a grilled pineapple ring on it, the pineapple was the most cooked part of the burger when I got it. The burger patty was dripping blood and red on the inside, I asked the waiter if it could be cooked longer and he told me that it was supposed to be that way, and that it was only a little pink. Eventually he relented and threw it back on the grill, and it came back still cold in the centre. Not worth the cost of the menu items for the service."}
{"text":"Decent place for some shawarma in the Oakville area. 10% discount if you show your Sheridan student card.  I ordered the Montfort chicken wrap since my manager recommended it to us. Service was quick considering we had a table of 8 and they were moderately busy.  The pita was filled to the brim with chicken and had some pineapple chunks in it.   For toppings, it only had lettuce, so it is definitely lacking in terms of other vegetables. However, if you're a chicken lover, this wrap is definitely for you.  It was very filling and was an affordable meal for less than $10. I also loved their garlic sauce that they served on the side! I asked for extra to put on my pita.  My coworkers had mixed feelings about their food. Those who got the chicken pita wraps all agreed that it was good. However, my coworker who went for the steak pita didn't end up finishing her food and had \"meh\" feelings about it.  Overall, I would recommend coming here for inexpensive pitas/sandwiches. All the other food, such as plates, seemed to only be okay."}
{"text":"I have only ordered takeout from this restaurant so I cannot speak to the quality of the service but the food was mediocre at best. I ordered pork souvlaki with home fries. The pork was dry and shrivelled, the home fries were disappointing. They could be better described as potatoes more than fries, they weren't crunchy but soft and didn't really taste good. But the worst was the pita-it was dry and crumbly. The exact opposite of what you want your pita to be. The only thing i liked was the tzatziki and that i received 2 portions of it. This restaurant has a quality of a back alley joint, definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food.  I am getting hungry just thinking about it, and I just stuffed myself 20 minutes ago.  This is the best mediterranean restaurant I have ever been to.   Service is fair, but the inside decor is nice, and the food quality is top notch.  They are also open late for late night eating.  I recommend coming here if you're looking for a place to eat between 11pm and 2am.    They also serve beer.    Derek"}
{"text":"I sometimes come here for a late night snack. I'm in love with their baba ganoush. Its beautifully balanced. Best part is their pitas. Warmed on the grill, they are fresh and very tasty. To be honest, I don't really stay for a meal, but take my baba ganoush home as I'm usually there pretty late. Service is efficient, food is fresh. For what I go there for, I couldn't ask for a better place. If you are going to stay, the decor is a little dated, and a few of the booths could use some reupholstering. If it was brighter, and a bit more inviting, I'd be inclined to stay for a meal, but for now, I'll go to the comfort of home with my take out."}
{"text":"I love mediteranian food!  My friends brang me here yesterday for a quick dinner and said its very good/reasonably priced!  The service was excellent. The food was SOO good! I got the chicken shwarma pita! Everyone enjoyed their meals!  The restaurant is not very big but they do have an outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"When I die...  there better be a Monfort in heaven...  I live in the US now and EVERY time I come back to Canada, going to Montfort for a chicken Shawarma is a must.  I have been going here since it opened in the early 90's - I LOVE this place.  They have the very best chicken Shawarma ever.  EVER!    (I just wish they were in California)."}
{"text":"Been going here for about ten years now and I've watched the service and food slowly decline. Don't get me wrong, the food still ranks as standard Middle Eastern fare however the place has lost all personality. Just came back from spending $60 on takeout and they were hard pressed to even throw in some extra garlic sauce!!   There are still lots of alternative restaurants in the vicinity that will appreciate your business more than these folks so I recommend you try them out."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner Sunday afternoon. The food was delicious.  I would highly recommend this place for either lunch, dinner or late night.  The atmosphere is beautiful with candles on the tables.  The staff are incrediable very helpful  to choose items on the menu."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went for a speed date while grandma was watching the kids, really needed some warm comfort food today. Drove down Trafalger and just turned into Montforts Plaza.  Walked in and the smell was already great, love the spices they use in here. Anything from Egyptian to Turkish to Greek, they have it. Apparently they are famous for their sauces, you can by them at Whole Foods which is down the road. They were really good!!   I ordered the Chicken Shawarma Dish and my wife the Lamb Shashlik Dish, the spiced rice was just amazing and the meat so tender you almost didn't have to chew on it. The soup of the day was the cherry on top!! This place just hit the right spot in every single way!!   I am coming back here ASAP!!"}
{"text":"Great food every time, chicken, beef and lamb! Sauces are excellent  The hummus with meat is a definite starter.  Service is good. Some decor updating would be nice."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch the other day. It took a while for us to place one order but man they were quick. The food came out in no time. The food was delicious. I ordered a steak on hummus. The onion and garlic chutney was amazing  One of the good Mediterranean restaurants I've been to. Must try"}
