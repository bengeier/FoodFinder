{"text":"Rude, rude, rude manager. Tall white gentleman, runs the location, doesn't serve anything non-meat except French fries and won't make them prior to 1030am. Another excellent example of awful service at the airport. Waited 20min+ for the egg brioche sandwich, paid 8.99, fake eggs, not brioche. I'd rather go hungry, and next time I'm in Phoenix, I will."}
{"text":"Good Burger. Worth the stop at the Airport."}
{"text":"Awesome.   The bread of the burger is fantastic.  The sweet potato fries are fresh. And the Hunts ketchup is better than heinz.   Plus hunts steam peel their tomatoes instead of chemical peel them!"}
{"text":"Believe the negative reviews -- I would give 0 stars if possible because I received 0 food. Ordered food when there was no line, the restaurant was not busy at all. Having read the reviews about long wait times, I didn't even ask about my order until I had been waiting for 25 minutes. When I asked about it, all the staff looked at each other in confusion -- they had never even STARTED preparing my order. This is a burger joint with like 5 menu items, food should be flying out. Inexcusable and, based on reviews, clearly not an isolated incident. Save yourself some (actually, a lot of) money and grief and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"$15 for a bacon cheeseburger is very high for just a burger, no fries or a drink. 
The service was friendly & fast but won't do this again."}
{"text":"Express means nothing to these guys!  I ordered a hot dog and sweet potatoe fries.  The fries were on shelf in 4 min I wait another 8 before asking what's up with the hotdog.  \"It's cooking.\"  A gentleman who ordered after me by about 4 people, ordered hamburger and fries. He had to leave to catch his flight and had to push to get his burger that sat on the shelf for at least 5 min and still no fries.  He demanded they give him the burger and abandoned the fries he paid for. They didn't even offer to refund. 17 min in, i can't take it any more I'm told \"hot dogs take a long time to cook\"  3 min later (20 min in) he calls my name and wants to give me the fries that have been setting for 15min.  I ask for fresh fries and 5 min later I get them with a toss/slide of the bag. 25 min and $15 for a rubber hotdog (hard to rip the skin with teeth when biting) and decent fries (but I'm pretty sure they spit in the fries)."}
{"text":"I was impressed that this small restaurant, located in an airport, was so good.  Food, service and all.  Generous portion, and my server boxed the appropriate leftovers for me to take on the plane, where jealous passengers lusted after them while munching on dry roasted peanuts!"}
{"text":"This place was awful. We were looking for a quick bite between flights and I asked how long it would take. 5-7 minutes they said. Come to find out one of the cooks was off somewhere ... one of the girls in front tells him it's about time he returns to work. He just smiled. 20 minutes later and almost missing our flight... start eating my VERY overpriced burger and it was raw!!! Horrible service horrible food."}
{"text":"The sweet potatoes fries were absolutely terrible. They must have been sitting out for over 30 min. They were cold, mushy, and tasted awful. There are so many better food options next door. I have no idea why anyone would ever consider serving such low quality of food."}
{"text":"Not even close to the experience of the original restaurant. Line took for ever and only 1 of the 5 burgers we ordered were right."}
{"text":"Express is hugely misleading. I waited for over 20 min to get a salad from the refrigerated section. When I finally got up to the counter the cashier told me \"just so you know, that will come out to 14.95 with tax.\" Fantastic. When I asked why the price wasn't posted she shrugged and the manager walked to the back, clearly avoiding me. God help you if you order something that actually needs to be cooked."}
{"text":"The place is run without any organization. I placed my order, paid, and proceeded to stand there for 15 minutes waiting while other folks came, paid and got their food. It wasn't until a guy ordered the exact same thing as me, and he got his order did I finally say \"can I get my order?\" Did I finally get served. 

Another guy I was standing next to waited 30 minutes to get his change. They gave it to him in all ones!  $40 in ones. 

No apology for either him or me."}
{"text":"We ordered Deluxe Burger with fries. She said it is going to take 7 minutes, by the time we got our drink and found place to sit, they called my name. Burger was cooked very well. Fries was also good. Must try"}
{"text":"The meat was good. The fixins were good. The bun was good. The classic burger was good. I liked how the size was perfect for me. Good grip with no spillage. The burger was stacked well. Definitely a good stop before your flight. The thin fries were a nice touch, different than five guys and in and out, no ketchup needed."}
{"text":"Food was good and quick service. However, charging over $5 for a bottle of water (regular cheap brand) is outrageous and is taking advantage of captive customers at the airport. I understand that these locations have higher overhead, but this is too much. We are stuck not being able to bring water through security. Does that give a reason to rape us with pricing?  It's like jacking up the prices on water after a hurricane or other disaster. It is scalping."}
{"text":"Accommodated my \"no bun\" request by preparing my burger on a bed of lettuce - thank you! 

A classic burger with bacon costs just shy of $15. Pretty pricey but expected for lunch during a layover in the airport. Thank goodness the burger was juicy and spiced well! 

Small to go salad selection but there's a \"to go\" booth near by where we grabbed a side salad."}
{"text":"Surprisingly shocked by how tasty this burger was but the price does not match the quantity of the meal. It's proportionality smaller than most other gastropub style burgers and if you add fries and a shake it's rather expensive than other dining options.  

I get it, this place appeals to those who appreciate a premium burger but to feed a small family with kids could be cost prohibitive. I noticed millennials and businessmen with expense accounts in line ordering and appeared un-phased by the cost.  But, if money is no object, then enjoy!"}
{"text":"When you're hungry I'm  sure you can look past the high airport food  prices, which I did. What got under my skin was the 25 minute wait for a simple hamburger and fries. There were only 5 people in the dining area! When I finally received  my food I found that my burger was undercooked after delving a couple bites in and my fries were soggy. What the hell were they doing behind the counter for almost half an hour? It certainly wasn't cooking my food. Others around me found their food in similar conditions today. The staff must be asleep at the grill. At the end of the experience I didn't have time to wait for them to cook another because I had to catch my flight and they refused to refund my money at the counter. I was referred to call and number. I'm sure I won't  be refunded in the long run. My time is more precious than the 14 dollars I lost today."}
{"text":"We were on our way to Orlando and needed a quick breakfast before boarding the plane. We saw De Lux Burger had some breakfast sandwiches, so we decided to try them. They were quite pricey, not unusual for airports, but we bought a couple of them. Turns out not only were they huge - they were very tasty! We split them and 4 people had breakfast! Fresh eggs, bacon, great \"sturdy\" bread - loved them. Guess this goes back to - you get what you pay for!! Don't miss these sandwiches for a quick, hardy breakfast while in Sky Harbor airport."}
{"text":"My bestfriend that I went to visit in Phoenix to me to this spot and wow did it amaze! Had a classic Deluxe Burger with fries. BOTH were very good. Now I say this time and time again, I am a burger oficiando, so I make it my business to try burgers in different locations. The burger I had from here is I would say is within the top 10. Not up to In-N-Out or Smashburger but better than that of 5 Guys and Shake Shack.

Special shout out to our waitress who I requested a milk shake with a shot of liquor. She asked me what kind of liquor and I said Bacardi 151. She replied that probably wouldn't go so well together. So I agreed and she went to one of the bartenders there and they suggested something lighter to go with the milkshake so I got a shot of Bailey's cream to go with it instead. Very good suggestion as the shot with the milkshake was on point. 

My next trip to Phoenix (although I do not know exactly when that will be) but I will definitely make my way back out here."}
{"text":"Yeah, sure, it's pricey, but when I was faced with a short connection, my options were limited.  Do I go for Asian fast food or the preservative box on the plane?  No thanks to either, I decided to pay $14 for a burger.  I figured I'd choose the ever so slightly healthier option.  

You know what?  I'm not sorry.  That burger was just what I was looking for.  It had good flavor, the veggies seemed pretty fresh, and the bun was nice and soft.  I'm not used to any of these things from an airport, much less from airport takeout.  Besides, I'd probably pay $14 for a burger from a sports bar, and this one was just as good...and head and shoulders above the preservative box I would have gotten on the plane for $9.

The cashier was very friendly and my burger went great with the whiskey I got on the plane.  It was a pleasant little airplane meal."}
{"text":"This place is expensive. I came here for breakfast since I had an early flight. I got the breakfast that's for $9.99. It did not include a drink so I got the FREE water cup. My food was good, hot and fresh but not worth the price. we are paying airport prices smh. The employee was nice and warm for it to be that early in the morning. Or maybe I'm just not an early person lol. If I ever have a flight out of that terminal close by I'll go there again."}
{"text":"From my point of view this is the best place in the whole terminal 4. No one pays attention to it as its tucked in the corner but the food is delicious if overpriced. If In'N'Out can make a great Double-Double for 3.65, I see no reason to charge 13.95 for essentially the same thing. Service was prompt despite my order of two normal sized burgers that the place calls \"mini\". No one can eat the whole damn thing so don't try to impress us with the food that's gonna go to waste. Serve coffee in addition to the usual soda pops."}
{"text":"Wow. How did this place get such low ratings?  For a fast food burger joint in the airport?  The burger was excellent. Condiments we're super fresh, fries tasted great.  The bread stayed together all the way to the end. Not like some places where the bread turns to mush and falls apart .  The mango smoothie was excellent. That burger filled me up."}
{"text":"Breakfast- If you want a pitiful adaptation of a breakfast burger eat here. It is copious amounts of bread slathered in butter with breakfast meats of your choice. Nobody took care that perhaps a hamburger bun meant for a large slab of juicy beef does not adapt well to dry bacon and a thin egg patty, no matter how much butter you use. I call it a breadwich. If you want a roll will a small center of egg and bacon or whatever you decide, painted in butter, please eat here - and order extra water to wash it down."}
{"text":"Great burger. For all the people complaining about the price, it's in an airport. Of course it's going to be more expensive. The burger was pretty tasty if you ask me. I also got a chocolate malt which was delicious. Im definitely going to look for the chain near my house. I wish they would offer a meal though. Don't get me wrong, it's a big burger and it definitely hits the spot but standard fries and burger would be a nice touch"}
{"text":"If \"express\" means more expensive, lower quality and rude servers, this place lives up to its name. As a long time patron of the original Delux burger, I'm disappointed. Maybe the sub-mediocrity that infects airport restaurants is too strong for any establishment to overcome, Delux Express doesn't try. Sorry. I was hoping for better."}
{"text":"Good burgers at PHX but very expensive. The brewery place next door is a few bucks cheaper.

They use niman ranch meats so that probably explains it.

Nice to get the sweet potato / regular fries mix."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late night departure back to God's Country.  Figured I'd try something different and went for the hotdog... Mistake!  They fries the heck out of it.  The shake and Fries were very good, but this place is $$$!"}
{"text":"Definitely not express... let you know how the food is when (if) I get it. All I can say for now 13 minute WAIT!."}
{"text":"Overpriced, overcooked, bland. The burgers are awful. The fries are edible. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"This place really deserves zero starts. Not only is the food horrible but it's overpriced for how horrible it is. 15 dollars for a burger with reheated patties shouldn't be allowed. 5 dollars for fries that can be purchased at McDonald's for 1 dollar shouldn't be allowed. Do not eat here you will be disappointed"}
{"text":"If you like shoestring fries, order the fries. They were my favourite part of my 10:30 a.m. lunch. (Breakfast is served until 10:00 AM).

The burger, at first glance, looked delicious. 

I would have appreciated a kid's sized burger or something because it was HUGE. I didn't need two patties and I didn't need a huge brioche bun. A smaller burger with one patty would have been more than sufficient.

As others have said: greasy. That was the only downside, and it made me really not want to eat that much. With each bite, I could feel the grease slide down my throat, too. And the bun was pretty saturated. Yucky."}
{"text":"Service was nice and my food was given to me instantly.

An egg and cheese sandwich on brioche with a small bottle of aquafina water almost $11!

I loved the brioche and the melty cheese.  The eggs where to hard eggs, almost as if they were microwaved in the bottle of a bowl or cup.  The yolks were very green.  I ended up picking them out and just eating the cheese bread."}
{"text":"Was almost scared away by the low overall stars but decided to give Deluxburger a go...because I wanted a burger and was short on time. They made my 'classic' burger fresh, the wait wasn't long, and the burger was substantial and pretty tasty. The biggest downside is the price. Aside from price, not a bad choice."}
{"text":"Below average food for above average price, which in itself shouldn't be surprising since this is inside an airport but couple that with poor (bordering bad) customer service and weary travelers, it could be a shit storm ready to explode.

Ready your popcorn people, I predict a yelling match at this location in the near future."}
{"text":"Usually love the hot dog here but this time when they cut the bun one side was literally just a paper thin side.  I couldn't eat it without getting ketchup on me.  Had to use a knife and fork.  Come on!!!!"}
{"text":"Got 3 burgers here for my boys and me.  Burgers were excellent - good quality meat, well cooked, good, fresh toppings.  Brioche bun was also quite nice.    I give it 3 stars as it was too pricey (3 burgers, 2 drinks, 1 beer) at over $60.  Also it was kind of dirty in the eating area (see pictures)."}
{"text":"Now I must say this is one good burger and fries ! Taste similar to five guys. Fast service . Only problem.......$18. For both!!!!!! Wait and a bottle if Aquafina water....$3.25!!!!!

Really???

Philadelphia international airport charges market prices - maybe they should stop robbing people!"}
{"text":"Waiting for a flight, I went ahead and had a breakfast sandwich with a orange juice. I had the egg, cheese, and bacon bagel. It was very good, and I would have it again. But, they do take advantage and rip you off for the price."}
{"text":"I couldn't be happier with their food (I ordered the jumbo hot hot) or their service. Hot dog was grilled to order in under 10 minutes, and the large size plenty to fill me for my 3.5hr flight."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible hotdog.  Ok.  So I wasn't in the mood for a burger so tried another option.  Asked for it with mustard, kraut and relish.  After 15 minutes, they called my name.  It's an airport counter restaurant, 15 is too long to wait.  

When I opened the to go bag, I had a plain hotdog, Luke warm, with a container of relish and another of ice cold sauerkraut.  For $18 for a hot dog, chips and an ice-t I was expecting a little more.  

If your in mood for a quick dog, walk to the other A terminal and go to Modern burger.  Much better service and quality."}
{"text":"I give this place 1 star and maybe it's just a bit harsh, but here is my reasoning. They have a double burger on their menu, it is $14.95. FOR ONE BURGER! No fries. No drink. Nothing. The burger is okay tasting. Not great. Just okay. The beef patties are really thin which is disappointing considering the cost. If the burger was $8.00, maybe it gets a 2 on the scale."}
{"text":"Just awful. Walk past it. Dry burger. $30 for burger, fries and a shake. Chocolate malt shake was good. Fries are decent."}
{"text":"$20 for a dried out burger, mediocre fries, and no drink served by an annoyed cashier"}
{"text":"This place is super expensive search around before just stopping here there are cheaper burger places than this. It is pretty plain even though it comes with lettuce tomato onions pickles. You have to add mayo and other stuff just to make it wet or its dry. Other than that it is your basic airport type place over priced and bland food."}
{"text":"The Phoenix airport seems to hold you prisoner. Small layover windows (my fault) combined with few food choices (their fault) limits the culinary possibilities.

Thus, I ordered a $14.89 bacon cheese burger.

Now, under normal circumstances I would be somewhat excited.  What could possibly be so awesome? What makes it worth $15? How many people am I going to tell about the \"best\" burger ever??

What could be so awesome? Nothing. It was an ordinary, flame-grilled bacon cheeseburger. The bun was beyond greasy. Like \"hey, have some Crisco on your bun.\"  It made it hard to eat and, on the run in an airport, not a great experience.

What makes it worth $15?  Lack of options. This section of the airport is a wasteland of food stands. 

Not a great decision to eat here. Save your $15 and put  a down payment on a bag of jerky at the news stand to get you by."}
{"text":"Zero people in line. Lost my order and cashier starts arguing with Line cook. 20 minutes later got sandwich. Geeez."}
{"text":"Seriously. $15 for a burger and you don't even include the fries. I'll remember not to order anything here again. This is price gouging."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly, however the food is not that great and is WAY overpriced. I understand that airport prices are always overinflated; I paid $30 for a burger, fries and a shake that were Wendy's quality. The beef was advertised as Neiman Ranch beef, it tastes like a Wendy's burger. The sweet potato fries were good, though...."}
{"text":"Is it a good burger? Sure. Is it a $15 burger? Not a chance. Airport prices or not... Its fresh, but you pay for it with both time and apparently wallet..."}
{"text":"I had to wait 26 minutes for just an order of fries. Everyone behind me and after me in line got their food and my flight began boarding while I was waiting. All because the cashier was inattentive and neither called out my order nor made any strong effort to get me my food after I told him what I was waiting for at the 15 minute mark. After 20 minutes my food sat on the counter and he kept taking orders from other customers instead of giving me my food."}
{"text":"As I'm traveling, in a layover in Phoenix and stopped at deluxburger to see how it compares to the other burger joints. I got the delux duo and was excepting the parties to be on one bun not to separate burgers on different pattys. So I got more than enough carbs for today. The buger was good for airport food but compared to a restaurant a little dry, the bun was good and I did like how it came with lettuce, pickles cheese and bacon however was a little sloppily put together but still good. Their fries solid obviously there's other places better fries but good for airport food. The one thing it has going is the staff is very friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"If you have about 15 minutes to spare this is a great place to grab a burger to go. If I recall it was located near gate A25 but I was too distracted by the anticipation of sweet potato fries. 

We had 35 minutes total to get from one flight to another and really needed food for our long flight ahead. This place was excellent. Our burger was delicious and ready in just about 10 to 15 min. They also had sweet potato fries and beer! Need I say more? 

The attendant was on point and the entire ordering process went smoothly. Our food smelled so great that even the flight attendant wanted to know where we got this yummy food in a brown paper bag.

 Thankfully we made it to our flight after chugging our beers and running Home Alone style from one end of the A gates yo the other."}
{"text":"I needed a quick bite so I ordered mixed fries for a little over $4 including tax. They gave out a decent portion of fries but they were overfried and dry! Can't really complain because it's airport food, but I guess I got what I paid for. Truth be told, McDonalds fries are much better."}
{"text":"Don't even deserve a star because they don't use Heinz ketchup. Got three burgers with bacon and an order of fries for $43.  Burgers were good, fries very average, but then u try to give me Hunt's as ketchup? For as much money you charge for your food, spending an extra $1 on a case of 1000 packets of REAL ketchup should me a no brainer. Why would I spend $12 on a hamburger only to ruin it by putting Hunt's on it? Just another case of people not knowing what good food is out west."}
{"text":"Simply terrible.  My burger was so overcooked, dry, and borderline burnt.  If I was not in a hurry and did not want to deal with the hassle, would have returned food after one bite.  Much better options at Skyharbor."}
{"text":"Seriously don't have many options when it comes to food in this terminal. It was either a $17 individual pizza at Humble Pie or $17 for a burger and fries at this place. I know we're in the airport but $14 for a burger and another $3+ for fries??? It can't possibly taste that amazing. 

The food was surprisingly pretty good but nothing special!"}
{"text":"Totally tasteless burger. First and last time I eat there. 

Super slow service. Had to skip the fries cause they took far longer than the burger to be ready.

Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give fewer stars I would. $40 for two burgers and a fry that were mediocre and cold.  We would have been better off at Wendy's.  Not to mention the 20 minute wait.  Save yourself go somewhere else. Anywhere has to be better."}
{"text":"I needed a snack before boarding my flight so I got the mixed fries and a strawberry milkshake. Hit the spot! Friendly cashier and efficient service."}
{"text":"Burger was so greasy oil sipped through the wrapper and the brown paper bag. Burger was mediocre at best. For $12+ it is clearly overpriced."}
{"text":"As a regular at Sky Harbor I had not seen deluxburger yet, probably cause I am usually half asleep when I get here. I can't say anything negative about the cost. It was a pricey burger at $11.50, and it was tasty and filling but it wasn't a \"big kahuna burger \" (Pulp Fiction reference) but it does beat the slop fest you'd get at Burger King in the other wing of the terminal. 
I played it safe with a burger as I had a long flight to Charlotte and didn't want to risk eating Pei Wei which was next to Delux. It was a good burger and it sat well at 35,000 feet. I would have rated it Five stars, but the speed of service was quite slow for such a busy hub, had I not had a good chunk of time before my flight, I would have grabbed the tried and true pizza combos from the gift shop. It took almost 20 minutes from decision to ingestion. If the line is short and you have some wiggle before boarding, it's good."}
{"text":"Slow and super expensive, even for the airport. $8 for hotdog, $11 for a burger and fries are an extra $3. Took 10 minutes to get my food and there wasn't even a line."}
{"text":"This a tough review to write. I recieved friendly and fast service. The burger is big with a nice brioche bun, a good amount of cheese, and fresh and tasty veggies (LTOP). The fries were a little greasy. Overall I was satisfied. The problem is the $18 price tag. Modern Burger does a similar burger for $5 cheaper a little walk away. I hate killing a place on price."}
{"text":"Great burger. Sure you can get a cheaper burger, but for the size, quality, and speed of service live a little. Not all burgers are created equal. Bring your appetite. I got the classic + bacon and can't imagine having room for fries. Great way to get satiated for that 3 hour flight to the east coast. Nice brioche bun, fresh lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. Good size patty. Bacon cooked right. You might need a jaw that unhinges to put this baby down."}
{"text":"If you have 1 hour to eat before you catch your flight...You DON'T have enough time to order a burger here!
From a connecting flight, our daughter was hungry for a burger and there was no line at Deluxebuger to order...so  how long could it take to make a burger, especially at an airport terminal where time is limited...
25 minutes later, still waiting, it turns out there were still 5 orders in front of her???  She asked for a refund as the flight was boarding.  The cashier was rude and caustic and refused to help.
We never were able to taste their burger, and lost $14 for an order we never received.  Based upon earlier reviews, we did not miss anything except the time we lost trusting in the poor attitudes and no service."}
{"text":"what can you expect from the airport? a fast food burger at the high price! the burger took a long time to be made, but the end product was just ok."}
{"text":"It's not that's it's a bad burger it's that $23 for a burger, fries, and a bottle of water is an absolute rip-off. Crappy slow service to boot. This place would close in a week if it wasn't your only option. Airway robbery at its finest, Dlux should simply be ashamed :( skip it and grab a bag of chips, it's not worth the price tag."}
{"text":"Fries are decent amount and a good price but I wouldn't get the double burger that I got for 11.50. I work at the airport so no discount either. Overall I just wanted to try, I rate 3 stars! it okay the bun was good the beef was really tasty tho. Quality was okay. Order took 10 minutes and I ordered from the kiosk."}
{"text":"The burger and fries were really good, soooo much better than what I was expecting.

But the price? Jeez. Come on now!

The burger and fries were made fresh, and I really like that. Lots of fresh veggies, and a decent burger to bun to toppings ratio.

But the price..."}
{"text":"Gah! I know they basically have a captive audience, especially for folks who've been chasing layovers all day, but next time I'm just gonna grab some Doritos at the convenience mart across the way. They're more flavorful, equally filling, and WAY less expensive.

I spent almost $30 for an overwhelmingly underwhelming burger, fries, and a shake. Oh and some iced tea. Must've been the tea that put it over the top. Or were these made with \"delux\" designer cows? On a quick look, their website indicates apparently yes. They even use the word \"delux.\" They should've at least featured that prominently on the signage, so you have some idea of whyyyyyyyyy it's worth breaking your bank.

The staff was nice enough, and I more or less ate the food. What I could stuff in before my flight boarded, anyway. It cost so much, I seriously considered taking it on the plane with me, but even my cognitive dissonance inflating the perceived value couldn't overcome the bland unsatisfying taste-less-ness. Truthfully, the only taste left in my mouth after this quick bite was miserly bitterness."}
{"text":"Ordered fries and they must have forgotten my order. It took at least 10-15 minutes to receive my order. In the meantime, people who ordered burgers and meals were getting theirs and they ordered after I did."}
{"text":"I have to echo what Jason M said 29 days ago. Sweet potato fries tasted great. My burger bun was greasy and the cash register  girl asked me twice if I wanted whip creme and a cherry on my malt. I said no twice and guess what. Yep. Still got whip creme and a cherry.

The service was quick but the overall dining experience was not worth $23.07."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger and fries, and found this place waiting for a flight to Charlotte. This is a nice place with a pretty good selection of burgers and sides to choose from.

I have to say that this burger was pretty good. I forget which one I got but I can describe it as All American, with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a piece of American cheese. It was pretty good., if a little overcooked and dry. That was remedied quickly by adding some condiments to it which made it better. It also comes with shoestring fries which were delicious and not too salty.

However, I found that this place was too expensive for the quality. It was a good burger for sure, but I spent about 15 or 16 dollars for a burger, fries and a drink for an experience only slightly better than McDonalds. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't something I would seek out again."}
{"text":"Had an hour between flights and barely made it! Burger is good, price is very expensive as expected but service is horrible. Waited 4 minutes to place my order while cashier chatted with her friend and then waited 20 minutes for the 1 cook to make my burger. Flight was already boarding by the time I made it to the gate. Management/ownership should spy on their operation to see how it is being run."}
{"text":"That's a whole lot of burger! It's about average. Not as good as In and out. Add on a fries and drink and this meal will run you $18+. It's plenty for two people to share. If you are stuck here at airport it's ok but if you have other options...pass. I think there is a Mexican place in this airport that I previously went to that was way better."}
{"text":"I decided to get a burger while waiting for my connecting flight at the Phoenix airport as I was pretty hungry. A quick walk around the terminal led to Deluxburger which had a menu focused on burgers so decided to give it a try.

I got the classic burger($11.50) and chocolate shake ($6.50). Like every other restaurant at the airport prices were almost double of what you would pay outside. After ordering it was almost a 15 minutes wait to finally get the food.

The burger itself was pretty big but not huge, with a lot of stuff thrown in between the buns. I could comfortably lift it and bit into it without making a big mess. There were two problems with the burger. First the patties were overcooked so were dry as a bone. Secondly the burger was over-seasoned. It had so much salt that I could not taste anything else on the bun, just the taste of salt in every bit. After a couple of bites I could not bear this torture anymore so I gave up and trashed it. The chocolate shake on the other hand was very pleasant. It was not too sweet yet sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. I would have personally liked the milkshake to be a lot thicker but this was easier to put down.

Overall not very impressed and will look at other options the next time I need to get something to eat at Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"The double cheeseburger was very tasty. ..almost worth the $12 it cost. 
It was the perfect snack to share with my little one after our bumpy flight from Ontario. ."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly, hands down, the best airport burger; ever!  Flame Broiled and made to order, this is a must visit in the Phoenix Airport.  Double stacked on a home made bun, this is the most expensive item on the menu. The fries are thin, crispy and delicious. A sticker on every burger indicating \"Niman Ranch\" leads one to believe the ingredients are fresh."}
{"text":"Burger took forever to come out (20 minutes?) for it to be bland and cold... Malt shake was good but this place is way overpriced."}
{"text":"Great tasting sweet potato fries. Music is way too loud. Burger is large but very greasy. Bun was greasy, and double patty fat had soaked into bun. Way over priced at $11.50.  Next time it's McDonalds!"}
{"text":"I was in a rush to get to my next flight. Would it be worth it to step into this giant line? 

The foodie in me could not resist in the end... i stepped into the line. I only had 20 minutes before the plane was boarding. LUCKILY it was right next to my gate. 

As I was sitting in line, I noticed there was an order kiosk that nobody was using. I know- these things are slightly sinister in that they replace people with machines... but man i was late. So i punched in my order. Took about 15 minutes for the food to come out. 

BUT WOW. what a gargantuan burger. It was wrapped in foil and looked a little bigger than a softball. It was huge, with really nice bread. Great bacon. Cheesy. Messy. 

AND FRIENDS. I ate it in 4 minutes. It was the most euphoric 4 minute in an airport that I have had. 

Also... uh. Are the two other reviewers really arguing about the type of ketchups? What about the burger? And why would you need to add ketchup to the master piece of a burger they give you? 

Make sure to get a lot of napkins. You will need them."}
