{"text":"I just left Coppertop and am really disappointed, spent $54.00 total for two fish buffet's and 3 drinks, had a table for 1 hour and 15 minutes, still had half a glass of wine in front of me and we were told to leave, they wanted to turn the table. Really???? When I spend $54.00 I expect to be able to finish my glass of wine. We waited for our table, I think we could have finished our drinks. Shame on you Coppertop, don't think I will be going back. What ever happened to customer service. We actually were very good customer's. no longer."}

Took some wedding photos on the golf course that turned absolutely beautiful! Very beautiful grounds! They made the evening very special for our family! Absolutely 100% happy with the entire evening!"}
