{"text":"I've had the number one and the number 5, both sandwiches are amazing!!! Everything else looks just as good and I can't wait to try everything on the menu. The service is good and friendly. The atmosphere is cute and inviting. It's easy to miss but well worth a try!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews but had to write one about Leoni's Focaccia.    5 Stars isn't enough for this place. Incredible sandwiches and the fresh and quality ingredients really put it over the top. I've never had focaccia bread this delicious. Very friendly staff who are passionate about their restaurant. No servers, you walk up and order your sandwich, soup or salad.  Either get it to go or grab a table and dine in. My first visit there and definitely won't be my last. Forgot to mention the cookie you get with your sandwich....DELICIOUS and melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Leoni's may have to become a weekly stop. Get sandwich #4, you won't be disappointed!! The restaurant has a very pleasant atmosphere as well, with a beautiful mural painted by a local artist on their east wall. The staff is very friendly too!"}
{"text":"Great lunch addition to Scottsdale and Shea!    With so many mediocre lunch restaurant chains in middle Scottsdale, it is such a relief to be able to grab lunch from a spot that focuses on producing great sandwiches using fresh ingredients.  Leoni's is run by local chefs that are well versed in quality, authentic Italian sandwiches.  The staff are friendly, the service is quick and the sandwiches are superb. Great bread and fresh ingredients = many return visits."}
{"text":"We were driving through the area and stumbled upon this hidden gem. Dwight was very personable and extremely hospitable. I ordered the mozzarella and tomato, it was delicious! The focaccia bread is made in house and it was amazing! We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"The bread itself is scrumptious. The ingredients are superb, however the sandwich is not worth the price. I would try Ike's Sandwich if you are looking for that bang = buck equation. Plus, customer service we had that day was horrid. But I am just writing on the price, I know we all have bad days..."}
{"text":"If your looking for an authentic, well crafted Italian sandwich, this is your place! My wife and I were very impressed and will be back frequently!"}
{"text":"Delicious hidden gem of a restaraunt serving a variety of delicious foccacia sandwiches and cookies!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENTE !!!!  I found the place because of the guy on the corner dancing with the banner!!  I'm so glad he was there!!  It was the hottest day of the year so far and he was out there for people like me!!  THANK YOU!!! I was in the mood for something new!   Now for the food.. Yumm.  I had the mozzerella basil and tomato focaccia... just the right size... (I'm tired of the giant-person portions served at many places....) and I don't know if they make their own mozzerella, but it sure tasted FRESH and yummmy ... the balsamic was almost a glaze consistency, the focaccia not too thick...  It was the #3.... I'm not vegetarian, but this is an excellent vegetarian option, if you are.... I just love caprese and that is what this was... caprese on focaccia... The ambiance was very euro-chic... the lemonade is house made and delicious (someday I'll get a gallon to go for my cocktails!)...service was outstanding..  They are only open for lunch, and don't expect a $5 buck lunch, but if you are looking for something different and delicious, Leoni's is the place!  next time I'll try a dessert with my lunch!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my 2 daughters and we each ordered something different.  And we all had a special requests that were accommodated.  Our sandwiches were delicious and the atmosphere perfect.  This is a keeper!"}
{"text":"I tried a sandwich (#3) and a cannoli from here after reading the reviews. All of the food was delicious, and this place is really convenient for lunch! I will be trying a half sandwich with salad combo the next time. Great service and amazing food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic italian deli with delicious sandwiches and desserts, this is the place. Friendly informative staff. Thomas helped us and he recommended the #7 which is the owners personal favorite. Also try the #4 and #5(my favorite). Will be coming back again"}
{"text":"Love this place! The #1 Mortadella is my go-to sandwich. It's so delicious and has a ton of flavor! The house-made lemonade is amazing too. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Looking for a friendly local place to get a great sandwich?  This is it!  Always on the lookout for a new lunch spot, and discovered Leoni's Focaccia on the Yelp \"Hot and New\" list (thanks for that!)  I went with the Mortadella, Gorgonzola and sun-dried tomatoes sandwich. The focaccia was soft with a nice crust.  The fillings were really great, and all worked together really well.  As we were finishing up, Danielle, the owner, came out to check on us to make sure our sandwiches were up to snuff.  (They were!) She is also the proprietor of The Breadfruit downtown.  She told us they've only been open about a month.  Very nice lady.  Leoni's is located in what I've been told was Scottsdale's first shopping center - a cool little area full of eclectic shops (and is also home to one of my favorite pizza places).  Give Leoni's a try for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"I literally think Danielle and her staff make the best sandwich (and traditional Italian baked goods) in Arizona. I stumbled here today from down the street and was so happy when I left.  Their interior is modern, very Milan feeling. But the smell of this place is incredible.   I got the mortadella sandwich, the #1. It has so much flavor in every square inch! I even tried the onion and cheese focaccia and a chocolate crinkle cookie.  I will definitely be living here through the winter, so if you need me, you know where to find me."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best sandwiches- terrific lunch spot. Nice to have a local, quality place with good fresh food and friendly service."}
{"text":"'Quality not quantity' is the operative phrase.  If you are lunch-lusting for a giant hoagie that no normal person would consume in a single sitting, an oversized bag of chips which the government says contains eight servings of chips and 4 days worth of sodium, and a refillable Super Big Gulp then this is NOT your type of Italian sandwich place.  Think gourmet meats and cheeses.  Tiny italian sodas.  Fresh focaccia.  Biscotti and fancy Italian cookies.  This is not your father's sub shop.  The focaccia is great.  The sandwiches are great.  The help is super-great.  My one (tiny) complaint is they didn't put any napkins in my bag - but I expect that was just a (forgivable) oversight.    If you want to save dough (sandwich pun) go to Subway - but if you have achieved enough in your life such that spending an extra $4 for a memorable, higher-quality lunch experience won't keep you from paying last month's overdue rent - go for it.  You will leave with a smile."}
{"text":"Wow. Great atmosphere and service. The food was delightful. We got a sample of focaccia upon walking in, and the perfectly-crafted sandwiches were accompanied by lovely deserts. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Naturally the focaccia is the showcase item here but don't discount the quality meats and cheeses stuffed between the light and savory bread.  In terms of similar sandwiches I'd rate it a half star higher than the Noble Eatery and a star below the still unrivaled Pane Bianco.  Definitely worth the effort of having to deal with the Scottsdale/Shea intersection and worth the added cost of in order to get a truly delicious sandwich."}
{"text":"Five stars are not enough! Walked to this place from a friends biz down the street and was totally amazed at the quality of the food.  Being 100% Italian I'm always weary about Italian delis.  This place delivered!  Even the focaccia pizza special was amazing.  Get the #5 it was out of this world good.  Can't wait to come back again!!"}
{"text":"CLOSED...nooooo....why?  This place is amazing! I have been here multiple times for lunch with co-workers, however this location in Scottsdale has now CLOSED!  Very sad to say that after a few attempts to call and place an order, I decided to drive to the location and place the order in person (this was after checking the website, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and calling for any hour changes) only to find out this location was CLOSED with a letter taped to the door.   But not to worry (I hope) the letter on the door said they are opening a location in downtown phoenix. So on that note, I'm anxious to find out where in downtown they will be opening and when (even though I will now only be able to stop by on Saturday's, due to their hours).  Sad to know the Scottsdale location is no more...."}
{"text":"I went back for another sandwich this past week. It still is a lousy location. But my Mozzarella and Tomato sandwich on the best forcaccia was excellent."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place near the northwest corner of Shea and Scottsdale Rds.  I was here for lunch the other day and can say that the food is fresh and delicious.  My sandwich was the #2 containing prosciutto, fontina cheese, lettuce, tomato red onion, mayo and mustard.  The focaccia bread was perfect and all the ingredients in the sandwich really worked together well.  The homemade lemonade was also really tart and tangy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stalk the \"hot and new\" places on Yelp and found this lovely sandwich shop.  What a hidden gem!!  I haven't found a place with a REALLY good gourmet sandwich and I think Leoni's has filled that void.  I got the #4 and boyfriend got the #5.  Both sandwiches were amazing!  The meats were definitely high quality, the bread was to die for, and everything was proportioned really well.  The guy working the register even gave us samples of the onion focaccia, which we will likely come back for.  Great spot for lunch!  Can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"Best Italian sandwich I've had, but it wasn't cheap. $10 for the sandwich alone. I suggest the \"veggie\" and add meat!  I added prosciutto. An excellent choice. Sandwich is large I was full. My hubby may have needed a side with his sandwich to fill up. Their baked goods are very delicious. Again a bit pricey. They got five stars for taste! 3 stars for value. Great place for a fun splurge for lunch. My friend and her aunt spent $30 for two sandwiches two drinks and two cannoli."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot and a total hidden gem. Freshly baked bread on a great selection of Italian sandwiches. They also do a punch card so every 5th sandwich is free!"}
{"text":"It's nice to have a lunch place that you can feel confident that your food will make you feel full but not heavy and slowed down. We had the focaccia sandwich with tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, fresh basil and balsamic vinegar, delicious! Our daughter loved the Italian chocolate chip cookie for dessert. It's also set up for to go orders, it's hard to find something on your lunch break that you won't regret eating later. Our lunch didn't haunt us until dinner, it was nice."}
{"text":"Decided to try someplace new so I searched on yelp. Saw this place had 5 stars so I gave it a try. From the first bite to the last I couldn't stop saying yum! This place is amazing and I wish I had found it sooner!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sandwich in Scottsdale, maybe the entire valley. It's tucked away and not a great location, but the inside/decor is great. It's a small place but there's plenty of seating. The menu is small with 6 sandwiches, some focaccia bread, salad, and some desserts and drinks.   I've only been there once and got the #4 which is a Prosciutto San Daniel. It was amazing. The focaccia was incredibly flavorful. The combination of the meat, veggies and olive spread was the perfect combination.   I can't wait to return. My new favorite sandwich spot."}
{"text":"Delicious, high-quality ingredients. But a smallish sandwich (nothing else) for $10 means I won't be stopping in on a regular basis.  They've been open almost a year now and I was hoping they'd consider adding a lunch special, but no such luck. Definitely a treat!  UPDATE: They've added a daily soup and half sandwich/half salad to the menu!"}
{"text":"Where to start. I am absolutely blown away by the food quality. I went in not knowing what to expect. Paid 10.50 for a prosciutto sandwich. Got the sandwich and the first thing I noticed that it seemed just a little bit smaller than other sandwiches for that pricing. You bit into it and flavors exploded in my mouth. The prosciutto, the olive tapenade, homemade preservative free out of this world focaccia, the shavings of cheese, the oil. My god I've never enjoyed a sandwich so much. Talked to one of the owners, Dwayne, and he told me about how their ingredients are imported from Italy. And he was a genuinely friendly guy. Love the place, love the service, love the food. Best sandwich I've ever had and as long as their open, they have a life long fan"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! A bit pricey, but worth every every penny.. The #2 Prosciutto Cotta is to die for. I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My husband had read a review in Phoenix magazine about Leoni's Foccacia so we decided to give it a try.  I am so glad we did. Like a previous poster said....it is truly a hidden gem. It's a cute little place. When you walk in the sandwiches are posted on a chalkboard. They also have a daily soup and few salad options.  The foccacia is To Die For!!!  My husband had the #4 Prosciutto San Daniele (Cured Ham), pecorino romano, tomato, roasted red bell pepper, olive tapenade, lettuce, vinaigrette. He said the sandwich was the best he's ever had.  I had the#3 Tomato, basil, mozzarella, balsamic. I've had this sandwich in different places many times but this was positively the BEST! The quality of the ingredients they use and the freshness really put this place over the top. The owner was very friendly and knowledgeable. We spoke to the owner in length about the prosciutto they use. Very interesting. Can't wait to go back. But will have to wait a few days till after Christmas. :( Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Cannolis- perfection! Focaccia- delicious! Small friendly place. The kind of place where you feel welcome and cozy. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I love a good sandwich and this place serves one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. Quality, is what this place is a about. Overhearing where the owner sources his meats and cheeses was really neat to hear about. The #4 is my favorite on the menu so far. It has the type of flavor that stays with you all day and makes you crave for another sandwich. These sandwiches remind of sandwiches I have had in Europe and possibly better."}
{"text":"What a fantastic gem. It's in an unassuming location but it's backed by the chef of the Breadfruit in Phoenix and that quality and attention to detail shows here. Absolutely incredible sandwiches on wonderful homemade foccacia, along with treats like homemade cannoli, down to the shell.   This is well worth going out of your way. Can't get over how good everything is, and reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Charming, understated, fresh, quality, priced well, friendly. Perfect for lunch. I wish I worked nearby because I would be ordering lunch for sure. Amazing desserts as well."}
{"text":"Amazing and fresh food. My first time here. Loved the bonus chocolate cookie too. I will go out of my way to come here."}
