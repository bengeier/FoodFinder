{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch options. You can get your classic breakfasts for around $5-7 and is a good alternative to the fast food options around the area. For lunch, you can get meat, rice/ pasta, side for around $8-10 and the portions are pretty generous. There is always a line up so I would recommend going before noon to avoid it."}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast and usually there is a line.  However given the number of orders, the line goes pretty fast.  Located across from Tim Hortons and Booster Juice, this food court joint makes a really great breakfast.  I've taken to ordering the scrambled egg on Rye with lettuce and tomatoe $3.15.  They have other options - BLT for $3.99, two eggs, two pancakes, sausage or bacon for $4.99, Omelette with everything for $5.39, and their breakfast special two eggs, toast, sausages or bacon, and potatoes for $4.99.  You can also add a coffee for a small charge.   You order, pay, and then watch while your order is being prepared production line fashion.    The food is fresh and made as you watch, the rye bread melts in your mouth, and the service is pretty fast considering its made to order.    Fresh ingredients for great value, this is the place to go if you happen to be in the Metro Hall food court. I probably shouldn't write this review for the fear that the line gets longer as more people start getting \"in\" on this place."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place as far as concourse food goes. Tbh the food is better than some upscale restaurants.  Service is fast and friendly, and yes the food is delicious.  Chicken is grilled on site , all fresh."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent spot for bfast. It'll be my go to bfast place when I'm in town.   I usually order the omelette (low carb). It's got a lot of stuff in it... and comes out pretty huge. I actually struggle to finish it, which is saying something. It costs around $6.   Minus 1 star because it does take quite a while for them to make the omelette... not convenient when you're in a rush.   Also minus 1 star because their smoothie is pretty bad (and it's not cheap). It tasted like juice from a can actually."}
{"text":"This is a good place for lunch. Usually get a box of chicken with rice and sald, or a chicken wrap.  They offer several flavors of chicken, and the chicken is grilled in front of you.  There are almost always lines, but they move pretty fast since the wraps, boxes, and salads are handled at different stations."}
{"text":"Loved this place when I came here. The line was a little slow, but it was worth the wait. The staff members are extremely efficient and generous with their portions. I ordered the Soup and Salad special, which was supposed to give me a \"small\" side-type salad - they gave me a fairly-sized box and stuffed it FULL with a choice of two salads of preference. The level of variety, the taste, the freshness offered at this fast-food place, ultimately made my experience here enjoyable."}
