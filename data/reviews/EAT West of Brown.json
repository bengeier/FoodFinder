{"text":"This place is horrible Delane our server was very rude and this little old man in Gary I guess came in and yelled at customers that were using the restroom."}
{"text":"Best Reuban in town! Vicky (the head chef and owner) could not be nicer. I would Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a bite to eat in the old town area. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We tried their fries as an appetizer to get us through shopping and it was amazing. We were so excited about eating there after a long day. A couple hours later we came back and the whole place smelled like marijuana. And not just a small scent. Super potent like they did it right there in the restaurant. Turned my stomach. Why would they do that? Their food looked so good. We couldn't stay."}
{"text":"Great for a quick bite and a beer, clean open kitchen concept for a lil pub was nice, if you're expecting a dining experience don't come if you want a quick bite of deli sandwiches such at a hot Rueben or that type of meal, sit drink and enjoy! If your a foody stay away, not for you!"}
{"text":"I would have given zero if this was an option.  Called in order for delivery.  Craving French Dip....it was \"not recommended to be ordered today\" by the person taking the order via phone.  Was then called back 20 minutes later with a \"sorry we got busy, can you come pick up your order?\"  Order cancelled and menu is now in the trash.  Will never call again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst experience I have ever had. After we placed our order,  10min  later we were told no wings because they ran out of wing sauce at 3pm.  Waited 20min for my mother a cup of coffee. When they finally bring us our food, my daughter order what she thought were fried mozzarella sticks. When she order she said I will take fried mozzarella sticks. What she got was a large mozzarella patty smothered in sauce. Before the witness even sat the plate down we told her thats  not what she ordered and she wont eat that....they waitress then told us they  don't have mozzarella sticks. After we all get our meal, 10 more min. Go buy and the waitress comes back with the fried mozzarella and tells us the owner said we still have to pay for it. We told her its not what we ordered  and were not going to pay for it. She then comes back and tells us her manager said she will call the police on us if we don't pay for the fried mozzarella. The manager then comes out and states...we must not be from Az because everyone knows what fried mozzarella is.. I have never had fried mozza served to me like that at any Az restaurant, the sever should have told us they were not sticks when we specifically said mozzarella  sticks. The manager said...why wont she eat them? If she wants sticks i will cut it into sticks! We told her my daughter does not like marinara and would not eat it covered in sauce. She  told us again that we have to pay for it and she proceeded to call the police on us. I have never been treat that way....ever at any restaurant.  Please do not give this business your money!"}
{"text":"Great place for a deli sandwich or a cold beer on HH! I had the Ruben and was not disappointed"}
{"text":"We were visiting Old Scottsdale and happened upon this place. We tried several other restaurants based on Yelp but they were packed and we were hungry. The food was good and the service was excellent. We shared fried artichoke. They were tasty but not as good as we had hoped. We asked for blue cheese dressing which was homemade and delicious. We shared a Ruben sandwich, very tasty. The dressing was homemade as well. We intended to go back but never made it."}
{"text":"This deli/sports bar is a great place to go for some of the best sandwiches in town at a reasonable price. Murphy makes an amazing Reuben as well as offers great customer service. This place is set back on Main Street in between Del Sol and Saba's, so make sure you look for it. There are very few deli spots in old town to get a quick bite to eat, especially in that area. They even have a few tv's so you can what your favorite sports game and get a drink while you wait or you can hang out with friends for a while inside or outside on the patio. Happy hour prices are great too and only $3 well drinks, a bargain for Scottsdale. They offer a great variety of deli sandwiches that come with a serving of fries, as well as hamburgers, hotdogs, brats, and salads. Next time I go I plan on ordering the deep fried chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich. YUM YUM..."}
{"text":"I went here with a large group of co-workers, so I will buffer my review with that premise.  I observed multiple sandwiches, salads, and burgers ordered.  The service was understandably slow due to the party, but the workers were clearly not prepared for any simultaneous lunch-time rushes.  It took over and hour from order to get the food out.  The food was overpriced for the quality. Burgers were under-seasoned and over-cooked, sandwiches were low on flavor, and the salads were decent save the lack of dressings available. And everyone agreed that the fries were over-salted.  Maybe the bar is amazing, but for the time/cost/taste experience, there are better, faster options literally walking distance away.   I hope I caught them on a bad day, but with as many choices as there are in the area, there is no room for \"bad days\" in that location."}
