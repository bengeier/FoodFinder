{"text":"Cappuccino was terrible. Vegetarian Sandwich was just a couple roasted veggies with nothing else, pretty bland. Plus they offer to warm it up but it has lettuce so it was all yucky an wilted."}
{"text":"Beautiful, spacious place. Great study spot. Strong wifi. Good coffee. Cool staff. So happy to finally have a cafe in pointe Claire village that has chairs and room to breathe."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, great service and really good place to study! On top of all that the owners are so nice. Highly recommend any warm drink with a piece of rhubarb pie"}
{"text":"Our family absoultely loves Studio 77. We cannot get enough! The cafe is beautifully decorated! Filled with beautiful art pieces and stylish furniture. Very welcoming atmosphere. Always my weekend pick for coffee (unfortuenetly dont live close enough to stop in before work during the week otherwise we would lol) Sometimes my sisters are able to get a week-day fix - depending on schedules that day :) I would highly reccommend! They host perfect little events ie. game night, wine tastings etc. They also host 5@7's during the week which I am dying to try! Studio 77 is a gem in the Pointe-Claire village! Go give it a try!"}
{"text":"Ordered two ham, Brie and apple sandwiches to go. Got home and opened the bag to something very disappointing... both sandwiches were made halfway with hardly any ingredients. They were simply made to look good in the display case. The photos show exactly what I am talking about. Had to drive back to return them. The man at the counter reluctantly gave us our money back because he did not see anything wrong with them. Also the sandwiches were warmed up but as you can see don't look very warm.  Otherwise the cappuccinos were very good."}
{"text":"Very stylish establishment fresh ambiance with the perfect touch of coffee for all the aficionados!"}
{"text":"My family stopped in for a quick Sunday morning breakfast. We absolutely loved the croissants (almond, plain, and chocolate) and the cappuccinos! They also have scones and other delicious pastries. If I lived in the area I would definitely come back to try more! According to the workers, they also have hot breakfast items during the week, but not on Sundays because it tends to be quieter.   They also have nice outdoor seating which we really enjoyed because the weather was lovely. The inside seating area is also very spacious. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely adorable. Delicious coffee. The owners (Corinne and David) are welcoming and so pleasant. I love this place"}
{"text":"A new coffee shop in Pointe Claire Village.  Its not on my way to anywhere, but I will go out of my way for Dave's coffee.  Great people, great service.  You have to try it!"}
