{"text":"Great place to keep coming back to! One thing to note is that the hours have changed and they are closed on Mondays (just went by today).  I always enjoy the chicken enchiladas with tomatillo sauce."}
{"text":"This is our second visit to Mexico Lindo. We came when it first opened years back.  We ordered the calamari, but they don't have it today? So we are going with the shrimp at the suggestion of our server.  The shrimp is our appetizer, I am having Chimichanga and hubby having the tacos for our main course. The shrimps are delicious! They come with bread that is basically garlic bread, I think plain bread would be better. Big jumbo shrimps in a little bit spicy sauce, very good! Our main courses were good also."}
{"text":"Great food and Service.  The food is simply delicious. Me and my husband keep on going back to this place - it became our favourite spot. In addition, my stomach is quite sensitive and I always feel great after having their food. The food feels healthy and it does not feel greasy or oily. I always feel good after going to this place.   The prices are very reasonable - they definitely do not overcharge. You get quality food for a reasonable price.   I also wanted to mention that the staff members are genuinely friendly, not pretentious, courteous and simply nice. They are very skilled in creating this relaxing atmosphere within their restaurant environment.   Me and my husband are always looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and service is friendly. Patience is the key here because they make the food from scratch. I've had the Basa Fillet with a spicy chipotle creamy sauce. OMG - it was delicious. The refried beans are sooooo good! This is my second time here and the food is very consistent."}
{"text":"Ordered: Chicken enchiladas and burritos - approximately $10 each.  The food was delicious! I enjoyed the salad, refried beans and rice that came with the meal. Both orders were relatively spicy (as expected) and were large serving portions.   Held it back from a 5-star review as the place/decor was small and better for takeout orders."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant while passing by with a hungry, growling stomach. Friendly staff. Wonderful food. Reasonable prices. What else can u ask for...."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican restaurant and bakery - friendly, helpful employees and fast, cheap, great tasting food. Get the al pastor burrito - excellent!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My friend found this gem one day and I have been coming back ever since. Good small shop. Not really a nice place to sit and eat but there are seats. I usually get a chicken burrito to go. The food is great."}
{"text":"We just went this week. At first we thought it was closed the lawn hasn't been mowed a fee cars have been sitting there for awhile. But the open sign was on so we went in.   Ordered pork tacos. These were fresh and so delicious. We also ordered bistec  ala mexicana , there was so much flavor. We were loving the fresh real Mexican food.    The salsa they bring to your table is great with chips but salsa maybe a tad warm for some.   The staff was very friendly and helpful.  We have been here a few times now and have not once been disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Toronto. excellent service from great staff. Excellent value. I also like the atmosphere traditional Mexican."}
{"text":"I LOVE Mexico Lindo, their food is always amazing and fast and hot!  I usually get the Enchilada Suiza or the ribs. The ribs are a fairly new menu item and I highly recommend them!! The staff are all very friendly.  The only thing that I would suggest...is getting a pop fountain and offer free refills. It's odd to only get a can of pop in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Mexico Lindo has become one of my family's favorite restaurants in Ajax. The staff is very friendly, the service is great, the food is outstanding and the portions are slightly intimidating. (That's a good thing!) This place is a jewel in an otherwise seedy-looking strip mall.  You'll probably wait for seats on a Saturday night, but it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! The food was very homely and humbling unlike any other family run restaurants."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for Mexican in Durham. What it lacks in curb appeal it more then make up for in food. This place is always a full house with pick up orders lined up out the door. If you want to change things up or just looking for great Mexican this is the place."}
{"text":"NO LONGER CLOSED!!!! Mexico Lindo has just reopened and the food was ah-maz-ing. Friendly, fast service. I ordered the quesadilla and it came out hot, fluffy, and was served with some very good hot sauces. The entire dish was only $4.99, and I could barely eat the whole thing because I was so very full. They do dine-in and take-out. Their new phone number is (608)219-0359. Very nice people- give it a try! Open on weekdays until 10PM and weekends until 2AM."}
{"text":"Contrary to the other reviews, this place is not authentic Mexican in the least, but rather a sad, bastardized Canadian version.  The only thing this place has going for it are its very tasty and fresh chips, but these are ruined by the most pathetic salsa I've ever had...literally soupy, pur√©e tomato with virtually no other flavours present.  For my main, I ordered a \"beef\" burrito, and the \"beef\" was saucy ground beef glob rather than the expected (and truly authentic) sliced steak.  I would have given this place two stars because the food was at least edible if not authentic BUT it's also needlessly expensive...I've never spent so much on a bad burrito (expect perhaps in fancy Manhattan neighbourhoods)."}
{"text":"The service at this location is amazing, as soon as you walk in the door you are greeted with a Hola Amigo/Amiga.  The restaurant is small and the food is never disappointing.  I love the fish hard tacos, my hubby love the chimichangas and my daughter loves everything here.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Had the beef enchiladas with red sauce. It was delicious. The server was very friendly and polite. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my comrades. Stay nourished, my friends."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant! I had the Tabasco(spicy beef burrito and chicken enchilada). The portions were really large. We called in our order because we only have a have hour for lunch and the food was ready as soon as we sat down. Atmosphere was really cool, and brought back memories of my last trip to Mexico. Service was great, I'll be returning soon. I highly recommend! James B."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican restaurant... I can easily give them a high rate considering the taste of the food... This is a classic \"dont rate the book for it cover\" it look small from the outside but they have plenty of room... And believe it or now, there are people eating there like ALL THE TIME..."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Servers were lovely, music was fun, food was delicious and quite authentic. Proper fresh lime juice mojito, Cuban espresso was great! Highly recommend trying it out.  Mariachi band on Friday nights also lots of fun and worth dropping by for!"}
{"text":"I would rate this place a 3.5.  The decor was greatly outdated.  The food was tasty Mexican food, nothing wrong with anything my table got.  Just be weary, if you're not into spice make sure you know what you're ordering with the waiter.  The pictures everyone has posted is exactly what we got.  In terms of the service, it was a one man show.  I get what other reviews mean about the service.  This older gentleman (maybe owner?) took the orders, showed people to their seats, bused the tables, refilled water, etc.  He did everything 2-3 waiters would do.  No surprise that getting his attention would be difficult.  We had no issues with the service.    FYI, if your mouth is on fire from the chorizo or other spicy sauces, Hollywood Gelato is only a few buildings north."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had I get the chicken burrito (chicken wrapped in pita, sauce, cheese sour cream on top, with the rice, fried beans and salad on the side. Very yummy when I'm in the mood for something real over Burrito Boyz/Fat Bastard. It's simple, family owned, and price is very fair for generous serving size and great quality. I think I've been going back almost every other week.  Not a fancy restaurant but an honest place for good food."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Mexican! Owned by a family from Mexico City, there is a lot of love and heart in these dishes. I had the Suiza Enchiladas which were awesome - perfectly spicy - and shared a pitcher of sangria. Terrific place, well priced, warm service - we will be back!"}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant. Food was great.  The decor was a bit tacky, but the service was truly fantastic. I would definitely be going back. Gave an extra star for the service."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service. Truly a hidden gem.  Small seating area but cozy. Will definitely be coming back with the fam to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite spots for Mexican. We have eaten here countless times and the food is consistently excellent. The Sopa Cancun is incredibly flavorful with a tomato-based broth, loaded w/chicken, slices of fresh avocado, cheese and tomato.  The salsas that accompany the complimentary tortilla chips are bursting w/flavor. They give three different kinds of salsa...mild, med., hot & spicy.  I highly recommend the enchiladas as you get two, your choice of meet, topped w/the sauce(s) of your choice. The Mole is sweet and quite an interesting choice! Why not try something new?!  The service too is always friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Incredibly warm and friendly service. Food is always fresh and well-presented. A gem!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and prices are very reasonable.  The owners, Martin and his wife, really look after their customers. Small cozy venue with authentic Mexican cuisine and decor. You cannot go wrong with any selection from the menu or their daily Mexico Lindo special. Everything in the menu is delicious. I highly recommend dining here for a casual night out, either on the patio or indoors."}
{"text":"Best place for Mexican food in Durham region. The staff is so friendly and the food is always great. I've been many times since they opened years ago and I've never been disappointed.  I suggest the chimichanga"}
{"text":"I love the homemade chorizo and hot sauce. More authentic than your typical burrito joint that just stuffs tons of ingredients into a tortilla."}
{"text":"My pregnant sibling dragged me here on a weekend, and I mean most Mexican restaurants are hit or miss, but this place is a home run. The food was delicious, and nicely portioned, I paid 20 bucks for my meal but in all honesty I felt itis kick in before I could even finish the last few bites.  Next time I will order their sangria's, the couple next to me had ordered two and man they were HUGE!!!! Lovely place!!!"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst dining experience I have ever had. My partner and I arrived and gave our order about half an hour before closing. Another group of four came in shortly after us. We ordered Guacamole and Fajitas for 2. They brought some complimentary corn chips and salsa to the table. The chips were stale and the salsa tasted like tomato sauce.  The server then brought over a fajita plate. We noticed there was chicken on the plate and we had ordered all beef. We flagged down the server who took 5 minutes to confirm that it was not our order.  About 5 minutes later it became apparent that our order had never been placed when the various servers started yelling about it.  One of the servers returned to our table to inform us that the advocados were not ripe so the quacamole would unavailable.  Eventully, about 20 minutes later, we finally received our fajitas. The beef was tastles and full of sinew. The wraps had large spots of mold on them.  During our entire meal the watiers yelled at eachother.  There was no apology for the mold, mistake in service or lack of guacamole.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Supposed to open 11am on Sundays but when we showed up, the lady says they are not ready and will open at noon.  Better call ahead next time.  Why advertise opening hours if they are not honoured.  We did not end up waiting."}
{"text":"Looking for something a little different, my friend and I (I from the opposite end of the city) decided Mexican would certainly fit the bill.  She had spotted this little gem some time ago but had never been and I had noticed the Yelp review when checking out options for the area, so off we went....  This is a small strip plaza with a number of resident restaurants, making parking a challenge in such a busy little lot.  Scooting into a vacant spot, we had to look twice to find our target.  Reviews had noted that it was a small place and that it certainly was.  Seating only 8-10, it seems a particularly busy take-out, with the line turn-over quite phenomenal.   We chose to grab a table, placing our order at the counter then sitting to relax and gab a little.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the salsa and nachos were a welcome taste treat.  We had a starter (shrimp in garlic and white wine sauce) that was to die for!  Perfectly textured shrimp, the aroma of garlic infusing the air as the owner brought it to our table....a wonderful start to the meal!  Followed by a pulled pork enchilada and chicken quesadila between us, we found the toppings fresh, and the offerings perfect for our palate.  The portions were more than enough, unfortunately forcing us to forego dessert.  Next time...and there definitely will be a next time...more of those wonderful shrimp and fried ice cream, even it we have to have dessert first to ensure having room.  Clean, friendly service, and excellent food...what more could your ask for???!!!"}
{"text":"Food was terrific!!!!  Service was also excellent.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really 3.5stars. Got the special which came with a beef Chimichanga and a chicken enchilada. There sides of salad, rice & refried beans. The portions were relatively small but they did pack it with meat.   I was slightly discouraged when i saw they used a premade salsa in the enchilada and it tasted ok. The beef chimichanga tasted good to me (although my friend said he tried a different place that fried it more than the version we got). The rest of the sides were average.  The actual surprise was the dessert. Deep fried ice cream. I can't describe it better than the picture I attached. This is worth the trip alone. But otherwise a decent food joint. Not sure if it's worthy of the high praise on yelp so far."}
{"text":"Such a nice little mom and pop place.  The food was great and the staff was super friendly.   I had the chorizo and pulled pork tacos and my hubby had the fish tacos.  They were all really good.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here several times.  It is so good!  I love the tamales, and the refried beans are so creamy and delicious... Mmmm.  Our complimentary chips came to the table warm.  That was awesome.  I got an imported soda, which was fun.  Food was piping hot, service fantastic, restaurant comfortable and clean.  I would definitely suggest it to my friends."}
{"text":"it didnt taste like mexican food. not enough spice and flavor . i did like the mexican vibe though could be a fun outing."}
{"text":"I crave the enchilada's everyday. (No Lie) Great people, real amazing Mexican food, beautiful atmosphere... go... now! The pricing for portion is a little high (I'm cheap), but the taste is incredible... worth every penny. *Free nachos and salsa when you arrive.  I got a corona, chicken enchilada's with green sauce and it was amazing... every time. (4x now).  I'll be back very soon, i hope."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great hospitality and very fair prices. Will definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"Great little Mexican joint hidden away from all the hipsters in a Scarborough plaza. Went in on a whim after eating at the nearby Greek resto. Apparently they had just opened. Had a fish taco and it was surprisingly great.  Went in again a few weeks later and it was obvious they've settled in a bit more. I had tacos again, this time the platter. Chorizo, pulled pork and fish. Came with salad, frijoles and guacamole. The tacos were once again great, price is good ($11 after tax).  Definitely check this place out if you happen to be in the area, esp before the hipsters move in and ruin it for everyone, including other hipsters."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican spots in the east end! Love the taco salad and their burritos. Will be going back for more!"}
{"text":"The food was just ok but, I'm sure they can do much better. I think is a bit overpriced for what you get, mexican food is not supposed to be fancy and overpriced"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food I've tasted! I can't wait to try more things from their menu!"}
{"text":"Mexico Lindo not only offers some of the best, yummy, authentic, fresh, and homemade food; but the best customer service and atmosphere. My food has never been a disappointment and is always consistent. The employees there, are always in a great mood and do their best to serve you the greatest meal! Oh and the insanely wicked prices ! Overall an amazing place:)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants of all time. The food is authentic and delicious. The staff is genuine and friendly. I can't count the number of times I have visited. The prices are reasonable.   They do take out !   You will not be disappointed if you visit. I haven't been to any other locations but the Ajax one I have heard is so far the best one.   My whole family, extended family, LOVE this place !"}
{"text":"Place is awesome. Best value for money.  You  will be hard pressed to find a place that gives you more food for 10 or 12 bucks.  Everything I've had there is good. My fav are beef enchiladas.  Don't know why ppl are hung up on the authentic Mexican or whatever....bottem line is food is good."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Ordered the nachos, chorizo tacos and sangria. The diablo sauce is not to be messed with; I ordered it on the side and it was hot!"}
{"text":"This place looks rough from the outside but the dinner and service was great. Authentic Mexican dishes. Delicious and not over priced. Great place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I, have been coming here once or twice a month since they opened! BEST MEXICAN food with genuine authentic service and style. Our waiter is always so friendly, and makes sure we are 100% satisfied. The portions are generous and prices are great!   I've suggested this hidden gem to a few close friends, and they all LOVE IT!   If you're craving some authentic mexican food, check Mexico Lindo out!"}
{"text":"Spectacular place... this is the freshest, tastiest Mexican food in the GTA... the staff and owners are friendly and talented... the sauces are homemade and when you have your first bite of your dish (perhaps chicken flautas, or burritos, etc.) you will be transported to Mexico.  I can't wait till they open up bigger places in the future... these owners know their stuff and will go far... thank you Mexico Lindo for authenticity and excellence..."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night in July because I wanted a place to drink sangria and eat a few appetizers. Based on the two reviews on Yelp, I checked it out.  I didn't realize that they closed at either 9 or 10 pm until I arrived near closing time. It didn't matter though, because when I asked for a spot on the patio the man behind the counter was very welcoming and enthusiastic.   The special for the day was a pitcher of sangria and nachos. I also ordered a calamari appetizer. With taxes and tip, it came to about $45.   The sangria was excellent and the appetizers were very good. The drink and food arrived very quickly. The service was very friendly and left a very good impression on us. I would definitely revisit this place for the same experience."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for take out, they take a while to prepare your order, so hopefully you are not in a hurry!  complimentary chips and salsa which is nice, they have awesome (fresco de Jamaica/agua de jamaica). The staff could use some more training in my opinion, but they are friendly which is always a great thing! Food is good if I'm in the area but wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Overall I give this place 3.5. Tried it for first time last week. Food: I didn't know what to order so got the Mexican combo to go. Price was reasonable. One box had the salad, refried beans and rice. Another container was chicken enchilada and a beef chimichanga. Food I think everything was really fresh and presentation was very appetizing. I only have one comment which  was that the flavours didn't stand out for me. It was a little bland. I expected more salt or spiciness. It was good but it felt like it was missing something that I can't quite figure out. The place was very clean and well maintained. There are a couple of tables so you can eat there. And while we waited they gave us chips and salsa which was nice. Overall I will definitely go back because it was still good. I also want to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Tasty Mexican food was good washed down with a corona. Good portions and fair prices.  Relaxed environment, dimly lit and slightly loud music"}
{"text":"This place offers freshly, basic, authentic Mexican food. My friend ordered the chicken mole and the mole sauce was perfect!  The carne quezillo I ordered was cooked just right and the refried beans were delicious. The staff were tremendously friendly and were eager to receive feedback. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out, received a great recommendation from the staff. The gave us salsa and nachos while we waited. And provided more spice salas satisfy my spice addiction. I'll follow up once I taste the dish at home."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for dinner tonight because of awesome experience last time.  It was pretty empty on a Wednesday evening.  The owners are really lovely and this is why I give it 3 stars.  The food is not what it was when I visited last. I really enjoy authentic Mexican food and unfortunately the food tonight lacked spice that I really enjoy.   The food was flavourful but not nearly as amazing as I remember.  I ordered my food spicy and they wasn't even the slightest tingle :("}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food. Everything had a lot of flavour. My favourite are the chorizo tacos! The only downside is that the staff seems to be very stingy with the complimentary chips and dip.. You have to flag them down if you want more."}
{"text":"Not quite sure what all the fuss is here.  I've decided to start reviewing the restaurants that fellow Yelper's have suggested only to find that many experiences have been a hit or miss.  Came here with my wife and ordered 3 hard tacos - pulled pork, chicken, and chorizo.   The pulled pork was over cooked and tasted like only salt was used to season.  The chicken was literally boiled and was also devoid of taste.  The chorizo was the only thing with any sort of flavour, but the amount of oil running out of the taco was a bit too much for my liking.  The plates come with a measly scoop of rice, salad, and refried beans.  These sides were far from stellar and did very little for the plate.  We were served chips and salsa initially.  This was kind of a let down considering the salsa was jarred or canned.  I expect fresh salsa when visiting a place that specializes in Mexican food.  While eating our meal, there was a rush of people from the local church near by.  It seemed many people were ordering the burritos."}
{"text":"Loud staff - yelling and singing, mediocre food, waiters (kids) dressed like street urchins with underwear exposed by below-the- butt-jeans... really? I see enough of that on teenagers roaming around the mall so I don't need to see it in a restaurant. The place feels seedy now. Messed up the order, overcooked the chicken drinks were lacking kick. Left with a headache and a sense of a deteriorating restaurant that used to be consistently good - something has changed. Cant go back until I see a lot of 4+ reviews for a long stretch... worried about the food poisoning other reviewers have recently posted... probably should have checked those first."}
{"text":"Very yummy and fresh! This is my go to place if I want mexican food."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great customer service. So glad a friend recommended this place to me or else I wouldn't have discovered it. It's a hidden gem and Scarb and better than all those other Mexican chain restaurants. Owners are also very sweet and really try to take care of their customers. It's also reasonably priced, and the portions are good.  My bf and I enjoyed it so much, we went the next day. We'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Mexican. Loved the chimichanga and beans. Mmmm. The hostess, possibly owner was so cute and genuinely made sure we were enjoying our food. Prices were decent. Portions were huge, but we were coming from the beach so we were starving! I'll definitely be back to get mexican fix in Durham."}
{"text":"My kids are not too big on trying new things, but they enjoyed the food. I would most certainly go again."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this food is just not good... Sure, if you've never had good Mexican food, you'd think this was ok but for anyone who has eaten Mexican in Mexico or almost anywhere in the states, stay away.  I feel badly writing this because the service was good and the owners are really nice but margaritas are not supposed to be made from a mix and not be syrupy, guacamole should have lime and chunks of avocado and the salsa should not taste like ketchup.  The one saving grace was the tomatillo sauce on the enchiladas suizas- it was pretty good.  But, asmy husband said, \"we could get better Mexican in Iowa!\"  Now that's saying something."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good (don't know why surprisingly, but certainly a great find).   A little on the small side, but great folks working here (esp. the chef). Their single tap --what can I say, I'm a beer fan/aficionado-- wasn't working the first time. Not a biggie, of course. Second order of nacho chips & salsa very inexpensive. Food was really quite delicious. We're vegetarians, and of course that was not a problem here. I would have gotten more (found the portions a little small), and will do so next time."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want fresh, REAL Mexican food. I lived in Los Angeles for 13 years and I am a chef so I know a thing or two about Mexican food. It's one of my favorite cuisines. First, this take out eatery reminds me of the many fast casual Mexican joints in Los Angeles that I used to frequent. It has a few tables and a TV on in the background. Everything is made to order. I asked for a sample of guacomole and they made me a fresh sample. It was very, very good. The chorizo was fantastic. The shrimp in white wine was excellent. I find most people who write negative reviews in Toronto about Mexican food really have no idea what they are talking about.  Let's look at Mexico. It's cuisines and origins reach really north...TEX -MEX -Cal Mex  etc....California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and every point in between down south of the border. What you need to understand about Mexican food is simple. It needs to be very fresh and flavorful. It doesn't mean spicy. Chipotle is not real Mexican food (and I worked their too) Taco Bell...well of course not. Just try it out and enjoy.  I recently had some take out FANTASTIC. Bypass Chipotle and hit this amazing mom and pop authentic Mexican comida (food). They have deep fried ice cream too!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A wonderful little place. Charming and quaint with great service.  The evening started put with my homesickness for Southern California and looking for some comfort food.  I was not disappointed.   We were geared with yummy nachos and salsa and a smile. I ordered the calamari with nopal ( cactus) which was rich, smooth and a little spicy. The  adapted my order as I do not like rice, and was given refried beans and garlic bread. My date opted for the burrito and enchilada combo, his first experience with traditional Mexican cuisine.   The food was amazing. A switch from the usual where often Mexican food is sloppy and heavy, great for comfort food, these portions were cleaner and lighter than their southern counterparts but not lacking in volume, check out the guacamole!  Finished with fantastic fried ice cream, the entire meal came to $35. I also had the horchata, a great deal totally surpassing expectations for a small place in a strip mall in Scarborough.  Kudos. We could taste the love!"}
{"text":"Not awful, but not the best either. Just ok. The bad: Enchiladas and chimichangas were a little soggy, and I'm not a big fan of beans. The good: Salad was tasty, as was the rice. Sauce was good. Inexpensive takeout."}
{"text":"I discovered this hidden gem about a year ago. The staff are extremely friendly and always have a smile on their faces. The food has always been fresh tasting and delicious every time I have come here for lunch.  The portion size is quite large and always satisfies your hunger. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A life changing Chimichanga that restored my faith in humanity, a burrito with a crispy outer layer that crunches deep into my soul and savory inner core that softens my wellbeing. A great meal to lift spirits as well as seek forgiveness."}
{"text":"Went with a few friends. The staff were very kind and patient. The food was absolutely amazing, I had the Big Burrito and it was definitely worth the price. Very filling and delicious."}
{"text":"We are always on the lookout for good Mexican.  Found this place online. It had great reviews and lived up to them. The portions are amazing. They even have a kids menu with authentic items. The portions are great and their mole is one of the best I've ever tried."}
{"text":"They make you feel like family from the second you walk into the door. The enchiladas are definitely something to try! The sauce is delicious! You can really tell that care goes into making the food here. Even the side salad is perfect! Love this place."}
{"text":"great  big burritos and tasty tacos for a price that is excelente  better than the new big chains of the burrito business."}
{"text":"Good authentic food!  Small friendly spot, good relaxed service, big portions.  We had enchiladas with salsa verde for lunch.  Good selection of authentic beer, except it was early and we had to drive.  And we enjoyed the colourful decor.  Fun things to see in every corner."}
{"text":"Had the chimichanga and beef tacos. Everything was really fresh and tasty. Good sized portions. Refried beans and rice were also delicious. Hands down the best Mexican food I've had in TO."}
{"text":"Had the Burrito for lunch, it was good, like you'd expect from an authentic Mexican restaurant. Service was excellent. Price is good. Parking was a nightmare though."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed. Delicious Authentic fare at an extremely reasonable price."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome.  I have been coming here since day one and crave this place on a regular basis.  Bean, guacamole, rice, and the Mexican Combo are the best in Toronto!  Thanks Sandra and family ;) PS the Sangria is wow."}
{"text":"This is a tiny place with that seats maybe 14?  The service is excellent, very attentive. Food quality and serving size is good.  Pricing very reasonable, except the price of pop - $2.  You can go to another restaurant in the same plaza and the pop is $1.  I had the enchilada which was served hot and very tasty.   The only improvement would be with the washroom and the area leading to it.  There could be some clean up of these areas.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Had a delicious experience here last night.    I ordered the Chicken Mole entree dish and my partner ordered the enchiladas with mole sauce.  We both agreed that the mole was one of the best we've had north of the 49th.  Would love to have commented on the Margaritas but we're abstaining after the holidays.  We'll return for the mole and try the margaritas!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Fantastic food and service. Not a large place but definitely big taste that hits the spot"}
{"text":"Tried to go here for our anniversary. No one acknowledged us at the door for quite a while. When the gentleman finally asked for how many and we answered three, he told us 5 min. There were several open tables, not sure why we had to wait, especially since I'm visibly disabled.   There was one table for two available at the front, and we watched him futz with it and add a third placemat to an already crowded table. When he motioned us over (he didn't come get us, just beckoned) I had to try to explain to him that this table was not suitable as my leg wouldn't fit. He said it was for three. I asked if we could have a four top. He said none were available. I tried again to explain that I'm handicapped and wouldn't fit at this tiny table.   Let me be clear, there were other available tables, but they were 6 tops, and he didn't want to lose the seats. I offered to wait for a four top but he said he couldn't tell me how long that would be.   So we left. So much for hospitality. He was rude and dismissive and I won't waste the drive again. We went next door to the seafood restaurant. It was fabulous."}
{"text":"The food here is not good. I ordered the enchilada, and could not tell if it was in fact an enchilada or a cannelloni. The sauce left much to be desired, and the service was poor. I actually felt bad for the staff, they were working very hard but there simply were not enough of them. I will not be coming back.   I am a big fan of Mexican food, but not this place. I would recommend driving a few blocks to Mucho Burrito and saving your time and money."}
{"text":"We have driven past this restaurant many times and weren't sure based on the appearance of the building. Since we've heard nothing but good things we decided to give it a try. The service was super friendly but not particularly attentive. The food however was amazing!! I had the Tabasco combo which at first looked like too much food but was so delicious I ate it all. The price is similar to what you would pay at an East Side Marios, Montanas or Shoeless Joes - so why not skip the chains and go for authentic?"}
{"text":"Walked in after looking at the taco Tuesday on their instagram which was 5/$10 and was greeted by the chef who confirmed the special was available for takeout so I ordered the beef expecting it to be bistek or steak because that's what's on their IG menu.  Got home to find out the \"special\" contained only 2 tacos and with ground beef & rice and salad -  but that was not what I ordered.  Called restaurant back to confirm and they informed me that promotion is \"not here\".  So whos instagram page is that ?  #mexicolindoondanforth. Lesson learned.  For what I paid I could have made ground beef at home. Not authentic."}
{"text":"Went for an early Sunday dinner. We got the nachos fiesta to start, I got the deep fried tortilla with her chorizo and she got the beef. quesadilla. Everything was delicious. Service was quick and courteous. Would recommend"}
{"text":"First time checking out this fairly new addition to the Danforth.  I had my son in his stroller and as it was 12:15pm on a Tuesday I thought I would poke my head in to make sure bringing a stroller wouldn't cramp other diner's style.  Turns out it didn't matter because the only two people there were the cook (sitting at the front table plucking away at his phone) and the server.  So I ask if it's alright if I bring in the stroller and he says it's fine.  They have an awkward stroller door (those without kids could care less, I know) and I struggled for a few minutes just trying to get in.  The cook looked annoyed with all of this and walked away.  First impression: this guy (this restaurant) doesn't care about me (wah!!!!).  Anyways, would have been nice if he offered to hold the door or something.  I take the same seat where the cook sat as it was in the front window.  Quick survey and the decor is fine, fairly neat and tidy but the floor needed vacuumed.  Considering how quiet it was there is no excuse for all the crumbs and food on the floor.  I can only assume yesterday was just as quiet so this was weekend leftover's I was looking at...  The menu is not too big, not too small, all your mexican favorites.  The server was very friendly and nice.  She brought some tortilla chips and a very thin salsa(?) dip.  I ordered a chimichanga meal that comes with refried beans, salad and rice.  The meal came pretty quickly (5 minutes).  Which then makes me question freshness.  I assume the chimichanga was pre-made and then reheated.  The texture was good but I've had these when they are fresh out of the fryer and this was not that.  It was warm, not hot.  The taste was fine, didn't blow me away.  Only real seasoning was salt and just a little too much for my tastes.  With a coke my bill came to $16 plus tip.  As I ate, I would take glances over at the staff.  Both hunched over their respective counter's playing on their phones.  At one point, a remix of \"my anaconda don't want none\" was being mixed with video's that they were watching on separate phones.  Conclusion: I get that it was a Tuesday lunch and the place was dead.  And that maybe it's hard to get enthusiastic for the one guy who shows up with his baby.  But this place reeked of \"I just don't care.\"  Tiny simple touches would have gone such a long way.  Here are my top 3: 1)  Care about your customers (help the guy with the baby stroller, be embarrassed about your dirty floors, look busy in front of even one customer instead of turning to your phone. 2)  Get fresh - how about some real salsa.  Take 3 minutes to chop up some tomato, onion, cilantro, a squeeze of lime.  Offer some \"house hot sauce\" or fresh limes at the table.   3) Not unlike #1, you have to give a damn.  Whoever owns this business has sunk money into it.  They are trusting the staff to make great impressions so that I'll tell my friends and they'll tell theirs and on and on.  Now when people ask me about that Mexican place at Logan and Danforth I'll say:  Meh, it's like a slightly better taco bell only more expensive.  It's a shame, I had really high hopes of this being a new go-to in the rotation of Danforth restaurants.  At best, I might try a take-out burrito or something, in a few months, if they're still open."}
{"text":"I can't believe Mexico Lindo doesn't have more reviews. I went there for the first time and ordered the vegetarian burrito with mol√© sauce and a virgin margarita (as I do not drink alcohol). All of it was amazing. The mol√© was incredible, the margarita was exactly how I wanted it to be. They give you some chips and salsa to satart. It's traditional Mexican instead of tex-mex (which I LOVE). Absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to check out this place because of yelp ratings. We were not disappointed! Small casual atmosphereI had the chicken quesadilla -- quite filling. I wasn't able to finish it, as it was also served with bean & salad, and rice. Really liked the rice's flavor. I had the option of hot sauce but did not take it. I also had a drink that i cant remember the name of (rice drink with milk and cinnamon flavor -- definitely recommend!). Loved the customer service! My boyfriend also ordered the rice drink not knowing that there was milk in it. The drink came and we had to tell the guy taking our order that he's allergic to milk and he didn't hesitate to take the drink away and offer something else. Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"Came here because of the location and rave reviews. Sadly the food was dissapointing.  Service 5/5 Atmosphere 3/5 Food 1/5  The man at front was very welcoming and extremely nice. We ordered take-out and he prepared for us some tortia chips with salsa while we waited. The gesture was delightful and the chips were crispy and warm which heightened our anticipation for the food. When ready, the man gave us 2 large bags and said he added some extra rice!  Our excitment was short lived. Our order: calamari to share, fish tacos, 2 combos of enchillada with burrito. Calamari drenched in salsa but was tasteless. Enchillada and burrito lacked flavour in their meats and was masked by heavy amounts of cheap cheddar and sour cream. Fish tacos had intense freezer burn taste. The refried beans as a side was the best part of our meal...  Very dissapointed. I wish the man at the front's kindness and enthusiasim would match the food but sadly, it doesn't."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food - delicious and great service. Kind of hard to find, at the back of a sketchy plaza but we'll be back! Portions are very large, too"}
{"text":"Absolute BULLSHIT!!! We arrived at 835 pm. The sogn says they close at 10pm. There were TWO empty tables. We were told to wait. Tgen we were told to get out of the way and to sit in the wait to be seated chairs. Three servers were working. Yes it was very busy. But after we were told to wait, no one acknowledged us again. They proceeded to serve drinks to the seated customers. We waited for some acknowledgement. For a server to grab 2 menus and seat us. Nope. We decided to leave...there wasnt a single apology or protest. In fact it appeared they were glad to not have to seat or serve us. Seriously...if you are that busy and you cant manage...tell us when we first walk in that you will not be able to accomoodate us. Ignoring is rude and disrespectful. Absolutey horrible customer service. Im sure the people sitting and eating will disagree."}
{"text":"Is there anything better than authentic Mexican food? Nope.  But wait, before you spend $ on a Mexican vacation, consider Mexican Lindo.   Mexican combo is very good value at $11, beef chimichanga and chicken enchilada with beans rice and salad.   However what makes this place special is the service. The owner is a hard working man who is warm, inviting and friendly, even when extremely busy!  How he does it, I have no idea.  He calls everyone Amigo/Amiga!   I wish I could come more often!!  5 stars"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden  gem. I'm glad I Popped in and gave it a try. Had the Tabasco combo and it was great. Authentic Mexican food and it was super cheap."}
{"text":"best place for mexican food. good food, big portions."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant after reading lot of good reviews. Food tastes good and service is okay. The space is a bit congested but it's good for a quick bite. Overall positive experience. Would definitely visit again for Mexican food"}
{"text":"Hidden gem.  Friendly chef.  Good authentic Mexican food and great value.  Best Mexican restaurant in Scarborough and maybe one of the best in Toronto.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Notice how Mexico Lindo's parking lot is always packed around 6pm?  That's cause these guys are awesome.  My wife and I go there every few months and we love it every time.  The service is always fast and friendly, and the best thing about them is that the food is different from the same old thing we always get a the \"usual\" places.  When was the last time you had Mexican?"}
{"text":"After seeing good yelp reviews, I had to give it a try but I was quite disappointed. I got takeout and the food was so mediocre, it's not something I would crave or even go back for. I wouldn't go back or recommend anyone, but the service is actually okay."}
{"text":"Very cute, HUGE portion sizes (which I like because I'll graze throughout the day while at work and the meal will last me all day and maybe a bit the next day and I love leftovers), however the food was quite bland. I don't like spicy food (my stomach doesn't agree with spicy) but I feel like maybe I should have gotten a spicier version of my dish for a bit more flavour? I don't know if perhaps the dish wasn't seasoned but I'm willing to give it another chance!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my husband & parents because my mom wanted Mexican food. I checked Yelp, & we decided to give Mexico Lindo a try. The parking lot was empty when we arrived, & we weren't sure what to make of that.  But, the food here is excellent; it's very flavorful, & the dishes all had a distinct taste. We had the chicken mole, Alhambres (not sure, but it's a combo meat dish over peppers & onions), & Huaraches (it's like a tostada but instead of a tortilla base it's a corn cake type base. In other Mexican restaurants where I've had them, they were called sopes).  The salsas & guacamole they brought to the table were fresh & tasty. The chips were freshly fried & a tad greasy, but all in all, it was a great meal at a good price. We would come again. My dad said that he would come back just for the guacamole.  They are also a bakery, & their dinner was so good I'm tempted to go back just for bakery!"}
{"text":"We first tried this place a few years ago when we still lived out in Whitby. It doesn't look overly impressive from the outside, and even inside it's a little small but the atmosphere is warm and welcoming.  When you sit down you'll get some of their delicious corn chips and salsa. The salsa isn't incredibly spicy, but the last time we went my boyfriend ordered a really hot meal, so our server brought over some extra hot sauce for us to mix with the salsa... perfection!  We love going back anytime we're in Whitby visiting family and friends. We still haven't found another Mexican restaurant that compares. The salads, refried beans and every entree... fantastic! We've never had a bad experience and we'll always recommend it to others.... we just wish we still lived closer as we haven't found anything near our home in the west end that can even come close."}
{"text":"Totally my go to Mexican restaurant uptown. Best guacamole I've had in Toronto, paired with warm toasted corn chips. I always order the chimichanga and enchilada combo which come with delicious rice, small salad and some refried beans. Best combo."}
{"text":"Went back the second time today. First time was a year ago. My mother in law remembered our first trip and the wonderful guacamole. We were wowed again by it and we tried out three plates of different burritos and enchiladas with salsa for our party of 3 adult and 4 kids. Slow atmosphere, good food and value."}
{"text":"Just okay. Bringing in staff that speaks Spanish does not make the food better. Been here a couple times and always leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Great spot, I've been here a couple of times. I absolutely love the guacamole appetizer. Sangria is good too. I had the chicken enchilada and beef burrito combo. Burrito was good, but I loved the spicy chicken enchilada. Would definitely go back, plus it's in a good neighbourhood too with lots of stuff to do afterwards."}
{"text":"As authenic as you are going to get in Whitby! Good food, good prices and pretty good service. Even sell good mexican beer! (Not just Coronas) I have enjoyed every meal here and was going to give it 5 stars but they did recently have a bad write up by the Durham Health Inspector. So will be keeping my eye on that fact. But upuntil this good stuff!"}
{"text":"I love the food at Mexico Lindo, and although I don't live in the area I try to visit every now and again. The owner, Sandra, and her family do a great job and serve authentic Mexican food and drinks.  I always order the chicken fajitas but everything I see coming out of the kitchen looks (and smells) great. The service can be a little 'relaxed' to say the least. Free chips and guacamole while you wait for your meal.  The only thing I would change is the prices, which at around $30 per person with no drinks, is a little on the expensive side. Having said that, this is true for a lot of Mexican restaurants in the city. Overall a solid four stars."}
{"text":"A family owned restaurant that you'll feel as if at home. The service amazing. The food is to die for....BEST BURRITOS!! We 100% agree this is the best Mexican restaurant in Toronto. The price is also very reasonable and you leave the restaurant satisfied. Sandra and her husband (the Chef) are very nice."}
{"text":"Bigger in the inside than it looks but gets busy for dinner.  Food is great big servings cooked to order and daily specials.   Came out  a Friday at 6:40 pm and had a 10 minute wait for a seat,  but they were very friendly and fast.   They are flexible with toppings (no  Cilantro please!)  and varying degrees of heat make it flexible for the entire family!"}
{"text":"Large portions that will fill you to the brim! Highly recommend the dessert, Sopapilla! (yum thinking about it just makes my mouth water) And really great service also!"}
{"text":"Great food but... portions are smaller than the location run by the brother-in-law on Birchmount Road/Huntingwood. Still a great place to go if you're in the area."}
{"text":"In a non descript plaza on Birchmount is Mexico Lindo! It seats maybe 15 people but the quality and service is great. Hola Amigos!!   The owner is great and friendly we got a few different dishes - Cancun, enchiladas and nachos and all were great. Big portions and solid food.  My only wish is to have a bit of gauc on the side for each dish and I would absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"favourite spot for a lunch. It appears it recently switch owner. Menu appears to remain the same. Seat down area is limited. I always go for the chimichanga as it is BOMB . the filling inside the outer crisp is a perfect marriage. bring your appetite"}
{"text":"Bang for your buck. Delicious Mexican dish served up by super friendly staff. Came by Tuesday after work for take out. We ordered the Tabasco combo and the Mexican Combo which came up to around $25. The lady gave us a complimentary chip and salsa while we waited for our order which was super sweet of them.  Solid burrito, enchilada and chimichanga for what you're paying for. Great staff and service. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic mom and pop place. Fresh, authentic Mexican food served to you by the nicest family. This place has got it all, automatic chips and salsa before you even get settled. I personally get the fajitas for two.  Good prices. I happened upon this place's other location while in an unfamiliar part of Scarborough. It was very busy with take out orders and obvious regulars who ordered without seeing the menu. I was flabbergasted by the experience. Then when I found out about this central location, I nearly passed out on my living room floor from all the excitement. Plus they have booze, so there's that too."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here and my first time I had a great experience but this time I just don't get it.   I came in around 7:20 and we wait about 20 minutes for a table which is ok for a Friday night, and we ordered before the waiter gave us the menu because we already know what we want while waiting. Now it is 8:45 my table is still empty, I mean it was full when I came in and now there are only 4 other tables beside us. I am really disappointed. And during my hour waiting at the table I see there are even take out order bing picked up, maybe we are just not that important???  I will say if you are in a rush or anything think twice before you came in.  Around 9:00 The waiter came to confirm my order and the finally at around 9:10 our appetizer finally came and then 5 minutes later we got our entry. We finished at 9:30, the restaurant suppose to close at 9. I mean how can you prioritize take out over done in customer, does that mean I should leave in the middle of the waiting just call order take out?   Don't get me wrong the food is good, but the services is terrible and no one even came explain it to me what is going on, the only thing I got is \"thanks for the patience! \""}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food. I've tried a few places in GTA and this by far has the best mole sauce. I enjoy their humble no frills space."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Mexican food and decided to try this place on a whim. We arrived at 730 on a Friday night, the place was full! It looked like a couple of tables were ready to leave so we waited. No one greeted us at the door the whole 25 minutes we were there. When the waitress cleaned off a table we actually had to go and ask if we can take it instead of them inviting us to sit. It's a very small place with maybe about 15 tables (all were full) so maybe they were too busy to be friendly.   I ordered the chimichanga and my boyfriend ordered the chorizo tacos. The chimichanga was pretty disappointing, just meat and blobs of cheese stuffed into a tortilla and deep-fried. The meat wasn't very flavourful. The chorizo tacos were absolutely delicious on the other hand and I would recommend trying that. The diablo habanero sauce is amazing but not for the faint hearted.   I would come here again when it wasn't so busy as the service was quite lacking and we had to wait a long time to get our order taken and our food."}
{"text":"The food is fairly good, but is overshadowed by my less than average experience. I don't live close and drove over to grab some Saturday night dinner. I ordered my 3 items, paid (I even added tip even though it was for takeout). I drove home, opened my bag and realized that the bag they handed me was missing one whole order. I called them to let them know. I was upset. I had to drive all the way back to pick up what they missed. When I got there the guy handed me the food and proceeded to explain how I wasn't charged for 3 meals, and that the guy at the front didn't charge me properly. I told him what I wanted to order and paid.  Because I had to drive all the way back to get my missed food, when I got home my other food was a cold, mushy mess. On top of all that my friend ordered a steak Burrito and got chicken. I don't know what's going on over there at that restaurant, but I don't think they do either. Making a mistake is ok, but other than just handing me what they missed they didn't really even try to rectify the situation. Is the food good? It's pretty good, but are there better places? Yes there are. And they don't treat you like you made a mistake when they were the ones that did. My wife had to eat cold mushy sauces for our Saturday night dinner treat. Thanks Mexico Lindo!....."}
{"text":"As someone who lives just around the corner, I can attest to the rock-solid reliability of Mexico Lindo. They offer a wide range of your traditional tacos, burritos, chimichangas and more, all for around $8 with any of their regular fillings. (Hint: ask for half-and-half in your burrito to get the most variety!) The only gripe I could muster is that the restaurant is small, so if you're coming with a large group or the place is busy, expect a bit of a wait. Nevertheless, the fact that they have such a large variety of Mexican food that is all delicious, alongside their very reasonable prices and friendly service (look for the gentleman who calls you amigo!), has all but ruined chain locations such as Chipotle for me."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my husband late Friday night, after 9:30 pm. Walked in and  seated right away. Friendly and attentive staff - fun fact, they're family owned the original Mexican restaurant that was here when we moved into the neighbourhood 15 years ago in case anyone remembers them - was a fave go-to for us. We shared nachos fully loaded and the beef chimichanga & chicken enchilada special - just these dishes were enough (and more) to fill us up. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second chance and was even more disappointed. Unfriendly staff. Food is no better then fast food. My burrito had been sitting under a heat lamp or something so long the melted cheese had dried up. Salsa that comes with the chips tastes like nothing.  No third chance happening here."}
{"text":"The moment we went in the restaurant, we were greet by this nice gentleman. The servers were nice and the service was fast, foods was delis, their margaritas was amazingly good! It will be my spot for mexican food for sure!!!! we ordered the taco salad, the flauntes and margaritas hehehee love it!"}
{"text":"Great great mexican flavour food.  Great size portions and staff friendly.  Price Fairly resonable.  Seated is rather reduce to a few tables but definitely a take out place as orders keep on going out.  If you decide to eat in stay away from door in cold days.  Overall give it a try."}
{"text":"I just can't get enough of this place.  We've gotten to know the owners over the past few years and absolutely love them.  The biggest problem for me is that I enjoy the soup (chef sopa or tortilla soup) so much that I want to have it every time...but then I'm too full to eat my dinner.  Fortunately, they're always happy to pack up the rest of my Tabasco combo so that I can have it for lunch the next day.  Their chicken and chorizo fajitas also rock.  I live nearby so I see the jammed parking lot most days...so I'm definitely not alone in my addiction to Mexico Lindo.  Adios!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walked through the doors of the small yet very humble restaurant your welcomed by a smile and a \"Hola Amigo\" to everyone comes in. The food is incredibly Delicious and its at a very GOOOOOOD price for what your served I recommend this place to everyone you'll enjoy it for sure and it will be New Favourite place"}
{"text":"Great food! Very authentic tasting! Friendly and fast service..  will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and it is delicious! Real Mexican food in Oshawa! It makes me so happy.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is really warm and nice, with some spanish and mexican music playing, not too loud! The walls are a vibrant orange color and decorated with various paintings, plates, hats, all sorts of colorful pretty things, it made me smile.  The menu had so many good options on it, and the food we chose was very tasty. All their dishes are served with rice, salad and refried beans. I personally would of liked a little more rice and little less chicken on my plate but that is the only complaint I have.  The staff were all really nice :) So we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout for a group of 8 and they messed up our orders. Boxes were labeled incorrectly, some components of our combos were missing. Quite frustrating. However, the sides were generous, food was decent. Would come back again but maybe dine in only."}
{"text":"I walked in here with my brother with very low expectations. The owner/worker was very welcoming and friendly. We ordered 2 mexican specials at 10.99$ each and a side of guacamole.  The food came out very quick on a hot plate and everything tasted quite good. The guacamole was made to order in a big cool pottery or stone kinda bowl. Very tasty I loved my beef Chimichanga. We left stuffed and both said we'd be returning as its local to our work area. I don't want to give a con point but I must admit I was shocked when he rang up the price, close to 40$ for 2 meals, 2 pops and the side guacamole."}
{"text":"I loved this place. authentic mexican vibe and a very cozy family feel. family run and very friendly . the food was great I ordered the enchiladas suiza and it felt like I had taken a Bite of heaven. very family friendly. Will definitely come again !!!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place because it's one of mr leny's favourites.    What I had could have been much better.  I ordered the vegetarian soft tacos which came with Mexican rice, refried beans and salad.  The vegetable filling consisted of sauteed broccoli, peppers, corn, mushrooms, onion and cilantro.  Unfortunately the mushrooms and corn tasted of the canned variety but I can probably understand why.  The meaty dishes are their biggest sellers and it is probably not cost effective for them to have a lot of fresh produce which they won't use.  Still I would probably return to try the burritos.  The owners are lovely and sweet and the prices are fair.  I love cozy little mom and pop joints."}
{"text":"I love this place! The red sangria is delicious with lots of fruit. You always get greeted with homemade salsa and chips. . The sauces are all prepared on site and they are yummy! Want hotter ask :) I normally get tacos but their edible taco bowl salad is also fabulous. ... no complaints from any guests yet except they ate too much"}
{"text":"If you've been on Caribbean vacations, you will find yourself saying 'Gracias'. Authentic Mexican right down the to staff FROM Mexico! The homemade tortilla chips and salsa is fantastic. Don't fill up on them! You've got a lot of food coming!  I've been here many times. My favourite is the Beef Chimichaunga. It's hard for me NOT to order it every time. Their Enchiladas are excellent as well. They offer different sauces for the heat-lovers and non-spicy people like me. The salad, fantastic rice and refried beans go perfectly with everything on the menu.   Even the prices are fantastic! Small place, but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This is a fab place to enjoy authentic mexican fare. Warm chips and dip on the table once you're seated. Everything looks and tastes so fresh You can get a real margarita here with fresh lime instead of the sugary green bar mix (as it should be)"}
{"text":"I'm Mexican and in my search for quality quantity and cost this is by far the best bang for your buck! Traditional food, warm service from Gustavo and let's not kid ourselves it's about the price! Come here guys!"}
{"text":"Nice Mexican spot on the Danforth. Absolutely massive amounts of food. I had the special with a Chmichanga and an Enchilida while my girlfriend had the seafood Enchilida. I couldn't finish the whole thing so had the Enchilida for lunch the next day. The order also came with a complimentary order of salsa and chips. We had to ask for hot sauce for the salsa (I think they are pandering to Canadian tastes)  Only downside was they were out of Pablanos for the Chile Riano. Next time!"}
{"text":"Overall, I really enjoyed my dining experience at Mexico Lindo.  Staff was very friendly, prices were great and the food was tasty.  Buddy and I ordered the Chorico nachos for our appetizer. Quite a generous portion with great flavour, must say that I really enjoyed it that if I was ever in the mood for just having nachos, I'm just going to get them here!  As for my main, I had the Mezlat√°n combo, and the bud got the Aji Camarones entr√©e. I'm allergic to shellfish so I can't speak for the dish, but from what was left on the plate, looks like he really enjoyed it. For my entr√©e, I must say it was great, the beef was seasoned well and the chicken in the burrito was not dry at all or simply just white meat, delicious.  Had the deep-fried ice cream for dessert to finish. It was what it was, frozen ice cream ball coated in cornflakes type crust. Always a fave of mine."}
{"text":"very homely feel. owners are very kind and their taco bowls are amazingly crispy!"}
{"text":"I just went there yesterday for the first time. The reviews are right in that the food is good, the prices are reasonable, and the people are very friendly. I felt welcome, and enjoyed food. The portions were very filling and the taste definitely hit the spot.  If you enjoy Mexican food, I highly recommend this place. They have certain items that are common in Mexico, but not usually found here, like the Mexican cactus based sauces and dressings. I am certainly going back again to try more of the menu, and enjoy the hospitality."}
{"text":"Very tight spaced with only one washroom (for both gender) to share, this small location is a hidden gem near Birchmount and Huntingwood (Scarborough). Whenever I crave nachos, this is definitely one of my go-to spots where they load the crispy tortilla chips with a generous amount of toppings! I believe it is a small family business and they do ubereats delivery. I haven't really tried other things on the menu except two types of nacho platters (about $18). But I definitely do recommend it to others if they are close by and craving nachos. Unfortunately, it's not the greatest for large groups due to the limited space. But definitely flavourful and service is decently quick."}
{"text":"This is the spot if you want friendly service, delicious Mexican food, and an authentic feel. Come in and don't leave without having tried the fajitas!"}
{"text":"I just love this place! The service, the food... If you're looking for real mexican flavor, you got the place! Great food for a reasonable price. Try the cheese with chorizo, and the guacamole!"}
{"text":"Took kids here for an un-planned vegetarian dinner. They treated us like gold and the kids loved the food!  The food was great, but the service outstanding!"}
{"text":"Don't let the interior fool you this place has some legit Mexican food!  The space is very small and is in need of some serious renos but the food is excellent.  I got the flautas which are like these deep fried rolled-up chicken tacos.  It came with rice, beans, and salad.  Delish!  Hubby got 3 different kinds of soft tacos and they were very tasty as well.  We also got some free chips and salsa which was a nice touch.  The food does take a while to come as they make everything fresh to order.  So if you are in a hurry may not be a good option. The server was very friendly.  I probably wouldn't eat in again but for sure would do takeout.  This place is in the same plaza as Chris's Jerk, Hunter's, and Wei's taiwanese restaurant.  Lots of good food choices in this small plaza!"}
{"text":"My family tried Mexican food for the first time. The owners were very accommodating and informative about different kinds of meats available.   I tried steak burrito large and the size of the burrito was pretty big. The tortilla wrap was tight and it didn't fall apart. The meat was very tasty and all the ingredients were mixed together very well and none stood out of place.   Definitely recommending it for anyone who's up for Mexican food in Scarborough area."}
{"text":"Best Value for Money Mexican Restaurant in the surrounding GTA area. Authentic Mexican cuisine done right. I've tried about half of the menu now and I have not come across a dish that didn't give me the comfort food O-M-G-soo-good-nom-non-nom willies. Don't be fooled by the modest location in a strip mall, the tacky decor, this place is worth it. We live downtown Toronto and often find ourselves making the over an hour drive just to chow down on the burritos, enchiladas, fluatas, fajitas and amazing fixin's this place puts on their plates. Trust me on this one - it's worth the drive to Ajax!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! As soon as you walk in you are greeted by friendly staff and told you can sit where ever you like. They have tons of decorations on the walls - plastic lizards and vines and other Mexican decor which only adds to the charm and authenticity IMO. The food is FANTASTIC I've tried most of the combos. The staff is extremely friendly and willing to answer any questions. They also have deep fried ice cream! They are Definitely my go-to Mexican restaurant because of how authentic everything tastes."}
{"text":"Why am I reminded of the bank commercial where the guy yells: \"Chexican!!\"  Anyhoo - I digress...  I was so stoked about this place.  Two reasons: 1.  I was chatting with a Mexican guy on Saturday, and asked him what his fav Mexican place was in the city, and he said Mexico Lindo 2.  I am a fan of the restaurant Mexico Lindo in Whitby.  I didn't know that they were connected....but oh Chexican yes....they are!!!!    So when I found out that this place was recommended by a Mexican, I texted up my gal Avitania B and we (along with my buddy, and her hubby Chad M) headed to Mexico Lindo on Saturday night for dinner.  Lets just say I ate until I almost burst.  Like the Mexico Lindo in Whitby (owned by the brother of Bayview's Mexico Lindo), the decor leaves a bit to be desired, but the food - ANYTHING on the menu - is aammaazziinngg.  I am a little scared at how close I live to this joint (and how much I love Bayview Ave), I will probably become a live in regular.  I love how all entr√©es come on steaming hot plates.  The refried beans from this joint are ssssoooooooo good.  I could swim/bathe/run in these brown beauties.  The guac is smooth and has a bit of a kick.  The chips served with their homemade salsa and guac are little trianges of deepfried salted goodness.  Make sure when you go that you get a margarita.  Or, do as we did, get a pitcher!!"}
{"text":"I only gave it a 4 because I have gone a couple of times and they were not opened even though the sign said they should be.  The food is amazing though, fresh and delicious ...I just wish they were more consistent about when they open. If you say you open at 11am...open at 11am!"}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic Mexican food!  Very reasonably priced.  Home made nachos and salsa are delievered to your table as soon as you sit down.  For an appetizer, order the home made guacamole.  Highly recommend the Tabasco combo (beef burrito with spicy red sauce and chicken enchilada with green tomatillo sauce) for your main and the deep fried ice cream for dessert.  Other locations: Ajax, Port Perry and Oshawa."}
{"text":"Just had a very tasty lunch at their new location on the Danforth. Shared their nachos with a table of three, then ordered the enchiladas suiza. It was a lot of food - their plates are large! Service was excellent and friendly (we had a baby with us - always a challenge!) The food was truly excellent. All made from scratch and very authentic. They even have a house made hot sauce that was too much for me! We'll be back soon. So good to have a new cuisine option on the Danforth!"}
{"text":"I heard through my sister who frequents this plaza that there was a Mexico Lindo here. Previously, I had been to the restaurant out in Whitby and loved it (I believe it is owned by a relative of the owner of this Scarborough location). I was so happy to find out that I can get authentic Mexican food right in my neighbourhood.   The owner is the friendliest guy, always greets us with an \"Hola!\" and a warm bowl of hot tortillas and salsa to munch on while we wait for our food to be ready -- even when getting take out.   I had the Flautas (deep fried chicken tacos) which were AMAZING!!! My mom had the enchiladas made vegetarian, also delicious. I've yet to be disappointed with this place.   It's kind of a hole in the wall, if you don't look carefully you might miss it. It's great to have such authentic, affordable Mexican available in our corner of the city. The parking lot can get busy, and peak hours like lunch and dinner can have you waiting for a while. I would try to call ahead to place my order if going during those busier times. It's more of a take out spot, but there are limited tables to dine at if you choose."}
{"text":"I ate here a few months ago in Feb, but I had to come back and review it because it was so good.   We made a reservation as it was a Friday evening, although we were only a party of 5. It is a small, cozy space decorated beautifully with a very authentic Mexican feel (NOT campy). The waiters were very friendly, and excellent with giving us suggestions. The food portions are huge and delicious. I had the chicken enchiladas, and ended up having enough food leftover for lunch the next day. I don't think anyone at our table was able to finish their entire meal. We did order 2 orders of the Mexican bruschetta as well. I also ordered a massive sangria which was very good and came in a glass so large I had to use both hands.   The prices are more than fair, the service is excellent, and the portions are huge. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area for a quick bite, or even for more formal occasions. If you love Mexican food, you won't be disappointed. Again, I'm not sure how busy they get on the weekend but I would call ahead with a reservation if you are planning to go with a party of 4 or more."}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers! I found this Mexican oasis in the heart of Scarborough thanks to your reviews!   Didn't know what to expect walking up to their nondescript location but I had faith! We were warmly greeted by the owner with his friendly \"hello amigos\" and complimentary warm house made nacho chips and salsa to nosh on while we looked over the menu.   We ordered 2 specials (very popular) the Acapulco and chicken quesadilla. Each meal was fresh and flavourful. The chicken was tender and beef chimichanga had a nice lite spicy kick to it. Well definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"...great little mexican place! it felt like i walked into mini mexico type of atmosphere, and the staff seemed authentically mexican. we started out being the only ones an hour before closing on a monday night, but it turned into an almost full house by the time we were halfway through our meal!  we ordered: guacamole with chips, excellent.  beef burrito and chicken enchilada combo, good.  beef chimichanga, good.  strawberry daiquiri, good.  guayaba daiquiri, excellent.   lovely service, it was only an older man and woman running the place. While the lady wasn't busy serving tables she was helping frying and cooking things up in the kitchen too! definitely returning to mexico lindo, it's so much better than el trompo."}
{"text":"The food is really quite good and fresh. My personal favourite is the Acapulco - a beef burrito and chicken enchilada. The sides of beans, lettuce and rice that come with most dishes are also very fresh and tasty. Food portions are very large. Prices and service have been reasonably good.   I was not a fan of the dessert (deep fried ice cream) but I'm okay with that because the core food is very good. I have come back regularly since they have opened."}
{"text":"Good, simple Mexican food. First off, I loved the hot salsa that same out with the tortilla chips at the begging. Better believe that salsa was going on everything once my plate arrived.  Speaking of the plate, I like how they offer a dish with a burrito and enchilada. It came with the typical sides of refried beans, salad and rice. I went with the Tabasco plate which had the burrito and enchilada covered in red and green salsa respectively.  There's not necessarily a 'wow' factor, but it hits the spot. Very friendly service and all of us were happy with our meal."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time, this place is terrible. They did not have much of a selection and our burritos were filled with sour cream and had no taste. When we were seated we were told they were out of fajitas which was not possible because they came with the topping and meat that were in our burritos. If I could give negative stars I would, there are so many better Mexican restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"My friend and I were really craving for Mexican food and we happen to be close to Mexico Lindo so we decided to try out this place. We were a bit confuse of their menu and wasn't sure what to settle for so we went for Mexican Combo instead. We shared the plate and it filled up both of us pretty stuffed! After we order the food, the lady who was working at the front came over to the table and gave us some free tortilla chips and salsa to start off. The Mexican combo platter consists of enchiladas, chimichanga, rice, salad and refried beans. The meats were really tender and soft and they were full of sauces which I really like. Really want to come back here and try their tacos next time when I'm around the area again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the guacamole and the very generous serving of shrimp fajitas.  These weren't tiny cocktail shrimp you get in some places, but a large quantity of very large shrimp (basically prawns).  They are now licensed, but beer was in bottles, not draft.  Washrooms were very clean."}
{"text":"My gf and I, stumbled upon this place by accident after coming back from the bluffs last night. And, I'm so glad we did. The restaurant itself is fairly small, not a lot of seating. They have a great selection of food. The server was kind enough to suggest their most popular dish, as I was indecisive.   He recommended the Enchilada Suiza, which was 2 corn tortillas filled with chicken, smothered in green tomatillo sauce, melted cheese and sour cream. OH MY! The dish also came with rice, refried beans and salad. This was sooo sooo sooo good!   I also love that you get complimentary nacho chips and salsa while you wait for your order..umm yes please.  Absolutely delighted I found an authentic Mexican restaurant, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The best!!! I love this place. The service is great! They are so friendly and welcoming. And the food is incredible! My fave is the Tabasco platter - 1 burrito and 1 enchilada covered in salsa verde."}
{"text":"Great Mexican fare in the middle of no where! Large portions for a reasonable price. Next time I am craving Mexican food and am very hungry this will be my go to place.   When you sit down you are immediately given homemade chips and salsa. Don't make the same mistake as I did and fill up on the chips. The portions are very large.   I ordered the taco salad. The salad came in a large nacho bowl with rice at the bottom, beans, and large pieces of chicken, topped with lettuce and tomatoes. I would order it again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Ordered via ubereats. Refried beans were very bad tasting, enchilada was edible but it wasn't tasty. Disappointing"}
{"text":"I go to this place about once a week.  I eat out all the time, and this is by far my favourite place to eat in the scarborough/markham area, they are consistently good and fresh.  Ive tried other Mexican places in the city (not all but several) and its not even close.  Also compared to the  restaurants (all types Chinese, indian etc) we have in the east end this one is just on another level.  I wont go into detail but they just know how to cook good food (without excess oil and salt) - you get a sense of this after ordering several things off the menu.  Anyone complaining about the \"d√©cor\", I mean really who cares brah...this is really a takeout joint.  Would you prefer to eat at a nice restaurant that serves bad food?      And try their steak and shrimp dinner, its damn delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write about this hidden gem for ages. What a pleasant surprise to find such a terrific Mexican restaurant in our Scarborough/North York neighbourhood. The service is incredibly friendly. We just found out this is a chain across the city run by the brothers and sisters of a very talented family. We are completely addicted to several dishes including the chimichangas with chorzio which is the stuff dreams are made of. The staff always makes us feel welcome - so friendly - and the food is just lovely. Unpretentious seating but the food is better here than higher-priced Mexican restaurants we'd encountered. Love, love, love it. You can eat like kings and queens on holiday for less than $35 for two. Such a great place."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had in Toronto. Equal to Cielito Lindo in Pickering. A great value."}
{"text":"The food was just OK. I love their enchiladas and chimichangas but I have tried their signature dishes they were pricy and disappointing"}
{"text":"Craving for tonight.. Mexican food.  I ordered the Camarones al Mojo de Ajo-Fresh shrimps prepared in white wine and garlic sauce ($18.95) The sauce was very flavourful. Even when it say white wine sauce, it doesn't look like a white wine sauce. The shrimps were good size and tasty.   We ordered the Nachos, corn tortilla chips smothered in melted cheese, ranchero sauce, sour cream, feta cheese, pico de gallo, and jalepano ($9.95) this dish was okay. It tasted a bit watery. I wasn't a huge fan of it.   Chimichanga -deep fried burrito with your choice of filling and mozzarella cheese ($12.95) was flavourful, but a bit on the salty side.  Overall, can give it a try."}
{"text":"Amazing place! The service has always been prompt, the food is amazing(my favourite are flautas), and their margaritas and sangrias are delicious!!!!! It's a small restaurant with about 10 tables and fills up faster on weekends but we have always received great service despite how packed they are. Love having this place in ajax!"}
{"text":"Found this place by chance.  It's the best Mexican food I've had in a long time.  I had the Mexican combo.  The portions are big and everything is real fresh"}
{"text":"Great place to get some Mexican food in Ajax.  There's no need to go down town find good Mexican food.   Place is nice and the owners are very friendly.   The food is excellent.  Had the burrito and nachos fiesta and fried ice cream which is a must"}
{"text":"Very delicious. We got the guac dip as app and my fianc√© got the combo with rice, burrito, taqueria (i think) and salad. I got the shrimp and rice. Sauce and taste was amazing."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food. Super friendly (Mexican) dude. Ambience.... Clean and basic as a fluorescent tube shining on a vinyl floor."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem! I saw it when I discovered Chris jerk. So for girls night we were like \"why not!\"  I'm so glad we did! The man at the counter was so friendly! I think he was the owner perhaps? Anyways onto the food!  I ordered the Acapulco combo which is a beef burrito and a chicken enchilada. It came with rice, salad and re-fried beans. I'm not a huge bean fan but these ones were amazing! They added to the dish with there own flavour. Everything was packed with flavour and looked so scrumptious to the eye.   I will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Abundant food...did not go home hungry.  Slow service but if everything is fresh I'd expect it to be hard to cook one meal at a time.  Guacamole was nothing too special, some cut up tomatoes and very little chopped onions...as a freebie I wouldn't complain but for $9...come on (-1 star for over pricing that appetizer).  The salsa which was free looked like tomato sauce with pieces of chopped tomatoes that you had to look for (continue with the first -1).  The music was loud as the table next to us asked it to be turned down twice while we were there (the host did turn it down but when the new music started, it was loud again and he had to be asked). The table next to us had drinks which look great.  All in all I'd go back but I'd skip the guacamole...oh and lots of msg..."}
{"text":"Have been twice for a mid week lunch. Good food, good value and quick service as it's not been very busy when I've gone. Nothing pretentious or trendy about this place, pretty basic furnishings, lots of Mexican tchotchkes and decor. No surprises here, pretty much what you'd expect."}
{"text":"Thanks to YELP for making the Mexican suggestions, tried Mexico Lindo which is reasonably close to home and quietly tucked away on O'Connor Ave. The soup was fantastic and the Grande Burrito was very GRANDE, the best Mexican food I have had in TO for years. The owners and staff are super friendly and attentive. Viva Mexico Lindo."}
{"text":"Mexico Lindo is a small mom and pops restaurant/take out establishment located in a small obscure plaza located in Scarborough that surprisingly has quite a few good food options. Also good authentic Mexican food is hard to find in Scarborough, most of the good Mexican restaurants are found in the westside of the city or downtown.  I ordered the Enchilada Suiza ($9.95 plus tax) filled with chorizo. It consisted of two corn tortillas filled with chorizo, smothered in creamy green tomatillo sauce with cheese and sour cream. The meal also came with refried beans, a salad and rice. The wait was about 10 minutes since it was made to order. The enchilada was good, not amazing but good. It was nicely seasoned, the chorizo filling was good and the accompanying sides (refried beans, salad and rice) were fresh and good.  If your looking for good authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price at an establishment owned by Hispanic people who are really friendly, then you should definitely try Mexico Lindo."}
{"text":"Toronto does not have a lot of good REAL mexican food places. Mucho Burrito is NOT A REAL MEXICAN RESTAURANT. This place is real authentic Mexican food. The food is made with real ingredients, it tastes mostly accurate. This place rivals places I have had in Kensington market, and is truly a gem in Pickering. I would recommending this place as real Mexican above the other local options of Taco Hell any day."}
{"text":"Terrific, authentic Mexican food. Good chips,, spicy salsa and a very tasty trio of enchiladas with cheese and the red chile sauce"}
{"text":"Best Taco in Town.  Beware they only take cash.    Most of my reviews are pretty harsh.  I grew up in Chicago and we are the fattest city for a reason.  This place was amazing.  The menu is simple only about 10-15 items, but you do not need anything more.  I ordered the steak tostadas.  They fry up their own tostadas rather than use premade large versions of tortilla chips.  The steak was hot and fresh.  They added cilantro to all of their toppings.  It is the small things that impress me.  My husband got the steak tacos and those were equally delicious!!!  Each was served with rice and beans for only $7.99!! WHAT?!  There food is simply delicious.  The restaurant is far off to the corner of a parking lot, but take a chance on it.  Please, I do not want it to close down.  When we paid our check it came out to $21 for two people (pop and dinner).  That is ridiculously affordable.  She did not have enough change so she was going to waive off her tip and the extra two dollars.  Luckily I had a few singles.  They are nice people with good food and their prices can not be beat."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican restaurant I've been for a long time. The food is very good. The service is very good. Inside the restaurant is very cozy and decorative. I will come back again for Mexican food.."}
{"text":"First time here and the food is amazing. Can't say any more then this. The place is also very nice. Very Mexican!!!"}
{"text":"Mexico Lindo is run by a family that is actually from Mexico: son takes the orders (he's a little slow), sweet daughter is at the register and mama runs the kitchen. Everything is cooked up fresh so there's a bit of a wait; the regulars know this so they call in their orders ahead of time.   Wouldn't recommend eating in when it's cold because the dining room is drafty, best to stand next to their rotating heater (see pic) while you wait for your take out order.  Tried one each of all the tacos with everything on it. There was ground beef, chicken, chorizo, shrimp, fish and steak (they charge extra for the last three); my favorites were definitely the shrimp and the fish. Orders come with complimentary tortilla chips made fresh in house delish! If you are lucky enough to come on a day they make their caramel flan, grab it!!! The flan is dense, rich and utterly sinful.   Definitely coming back to try their mole sauce, guacamole, calamari, nopales (cactus), pozole sizzling fajitas, deep fried ice cream and sopapillas.  Still on the hunt though for some authentic carne asada, carnitas, lengua (tongue), cabeza (head) and some home made tamales. If you know of any places hit me up!  Hasta la vista baby, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I just love coming to this restaurant! The staff are so friendly and amazing and we love the food - we had vegetarian and meat options and they were both amazing! And the margaritas - well a better margarita can't be found anywhere in the city!"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favourite restaurants. It's a small place and gets busy quickly after 6 but it's worth it. My wife and I come every week with our little boy. The service is always great and the food is amazing. The part that keeps us coming back is how consistently good the food is. I can always expect great food each visit at a good price."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Good food but noticeable decline in portion size.   Whenever I crave mexican food (but not Taco Bell), I go to only one place: Mexico Lindo.  Me and my BF were one of their first customers from when this place opened. I remember the guy (owner?) gave us keychains with Mexico Lindo logo in it.   This place is close to home and located in a plaza with enough parking. This restaurant is very small though, more of a take-out place. I believe it can only sit about 12 people in total.  Small menu but all choices are good. I have always been getting chicken tacos which I find very flavorful. Last time I went though, when I ordered soft taco, the tacos fell apart and I basically had to just use fork to eat my taco lol. They had put extra sour cream that caused the taco to become soggy and fall apart.  I have also noticed a decline on the serving size of the side items that come with the meal on my last visit (salad, refried beans, and rice). They used to put a lot of these in the combos.  Over-all good solid quality food place. Friendly staff. They used to serve really big serving sizes but I did notice a decline in portion size on both the main dish and sides, sadly.    Review 21 of 100"}
{"text":"Ordered enchiladas, guacamole and chips and churros from them.  The enchiladas weren't good, the guacamole was good but the chips tasted like some store bought chips and the churros were stale and didn't even taste sweet.  Having lived in Southern California for a few years, I have high standards for Mexican food and this place would be on the very low end of the scale.  I paid $40 for my ubereats order which is a total joke for the low quality of the food.  If you're in Toronto and want Mexican food, go to Xola on Queen Street East in the beaches instead - you won't be disappointed by them."}
{"text":"I'm between an A-Okay and an I'm a Fan. In other words, a 3.5. I'd come again, but I'm still slightly ambivalent.   Had a sit-down meal with mother dearest today. Even before we ordered, my mother sat down and we were given a basket of complimentary nachos and salsa. That was a lovely starting touch. The owner is incredibly friendly. He is also incredibly hospitable.   Had:  \"Special\" meal ($10.95) - one chicken chimichanga and one ground beef enchilada, served with rice, beans and salad. Most of the menu choices at Mexico Lindo have filling options, but this special meal had pre-set fillings. I don't know whether they can be substituted for other fillings. I neglected to ask. The plate came super hot (temperature-wise), as the enchilada had been in the oven on the plate it was served on. I'm guessing that the chimichanga was soggy because it had been baked after it had been deep fried. That was a slight bit of a downer. The enchilada was tasty. The ground beef was not particularly special. Tasted kinda like homemade taco beef. Lots of it though. That was a nice touch. So was the red salsa and the green salsa (on opposite ends of the enchilada separated by a middle of sour cream). Chicken in the chimichanga was a tad dry. Lots of cheese on top though. Mmmm. Melted cheese. Rice was decent, although my first bite was incredibly salty. Beans were pureed and slightly spicy. I wish they were a tad more savory though. Salad was lettuce with corn, red onions, tomato, black beans and possibly some feta. Served with a vinegary dressing.  Pulled pork Quesadilla ($6.95 for quesadilla only) - crisp tortilla. Inside was pure pulled pork. Tortilla topped with sour cream. Pulled pork was delicious and tender. Savory, not bbq sauce sweet. Pulled pork was the highlight of the entire meal. Next time I come, I'm getting something with pulled pork filling. Price wise, entirely decent as well."}
{"text":"The best mexican restaurant I have been to (this is my first authentic mexican restaurant beside's chipotle, taco del mar and fat bastard burrito co.)  I had the camrones in the spicy sauce. Shrimp  were very succulent and sauce tasted yummy, anyone who likes shrimp should try this. I went with the smaller portion and after tasting, I really regret not going for the bigger portion.   And my girlfriend had the enchiladas suizas. The crepes were stuffed with veggies and cheese topped with sour cream, cheese and enchilada souce. And they had a side of salad, rice and beans, its just worth every penny.  This is my new favourite place..!!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited for this place because it had been such a long time since I've had Mexican food. While everything tasted great I was slightly disappointed by the mediocre serving sizes. And warning that the complimentary salsa is very spicy! Also, not that it's the restaurant's fault, but there's a huge sidewalk planter right in front of the entrance which made it pretty much impossible for our stroller to go through. A wheelchair would definitely not be able to pass so heads up. Otherwise seems like a casual and family-friendly place."}
{"text":"Just discovered this little gem. We are always looking for authentic Mexican food with good portion sizes for the price. They are take out orientated with a few tables for dine in. Pros: - good portion sizes, most meals come with refried beans, rice and salad - you get a complimentary salsa and chips while you wait - home style cooking - can't beat the prices in this part of town  Cons: - they almost always never have flan or horchata - long wait times for your food sometimes 30-45 mins for your meal  We go back here weekly. Definitely recommend the fish tacos, the Acapulco ( beef burrito and chicken enchilada combo) and horchata if you can get your hands on some ;)"}
{"text":"A very casual, affordable place for great mexican food. My brother-in-law's favourite cuisine is mexican, and he really loved this place.   I don't remember what I ordered but I'm pretty sure we all got enchilada meals because they were a great deal. And the hostess was really great about making sure we had enough hot (not stale) chips for our guacamole. The meals were delicious and greatly portioned.  One star off because it's not necessarily a place I'm running to. But it was a nice change from the over-trendy places downtown. If you're in Scarborough and looking for some Mexican, this is a good place. The decor and ambience is a bit nonexistent but the service is friendly and the food is yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm going to try to review Mexico Lindo just purely from a general food perspective as I know almost next to nothing regarding Mexican food besides Tex Mex fast food.  I have to admit I was confused as I first stepped in here with the wealth of options and menu items that I haven't come across before, but trying new things is always good, and the special mexican combo seemed to be just that! A full platter of chicken enchilada, beef  chimichanga, and some rice, beans, and salad. It's a safe thing to order here for newcomers like me to try some authentic Mexican cuisine.   While we were waiting we were given a complimentary order or homemade tortilla chips and salsa. Before I go and talk about their food, I have to say everything here wasn't overly salty in a good way. The flavors shined through, the food seemed healthy and delicious, especially since fast food Tex Mex seems to really use too much salt. This was a nice change and everything was much 'cleaner' as a result.  Everything was super fresh, there was only one lady in the kitchen, so it did take a while, but it's well worth that wait! The portion size of the Mexican combo was huge. The chimichanga and the enchilada was great, the meats were tender and soft, and the tortillas were fresh. Having tried them both for the first time was interesting, it's kind of like a burrito you eat with a knife and fork. Even the rice, salad, and beans were good. Props to them for giving a good salad. The tacos were also quite loaded, we opted for the hard shell instead of the soft and they were filled with fish that was meaty and was not heavily battered. It was loaded with veggies and salsa, everything worked well. The only thing I didn't like was that for the special tacos you had to get three of the same kind. I wanted to try the other kinds (shrimp and steak) but it makes sense because everything is fresh, that they have to do it this way."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend a while back and it was a very good experience. The customer service was perfect, they treated us like we were regulars even though it was my first time. The restaurant was very busy and they were short on employees on that day so the wait was a bit long, but they gave us some bowls of salsa and guacamole free of charge as an apology. We didn't mind the wait since the food was worth it. I ordered the beef quesadilla and it was to die for. I enjoyed it very much. Definitely coming back here, I highly recommend this place for your Mexican cravings!"}
{"text":"Great service from the older gentleman (the owner maybe?)! He was super friendly and even brought extra rice for my toddler when he noticed she loved it! Great small place for a family dinner very and amazing food! We a ordered different meals and everyone was happy! Will definitely return soon and reccomend to everyone :)"}
{"text":"This is truly and authentic Mexican restaurant from the staff to the d√©cor on the walls and of course the most important thing the FOOD!   I came here to get some authentic Mexican food and they did not disappoint! I got the taco combo with the shrimp quesadilla starter and a traditional Mexican drink. The quesadilla was just perfect the shrimp where saut√©ed in a pan and season to perfection. The tacos arrived with the usual garnish everything looked authentic and it tasted like it was, it was spicy but not overwhelmingly it was just the right amount.  The tacos were soft tortilla - the best ones- my favorite were the chorizo (pork) tacos, but the beef one were really good too.   The staff is absolutely great! They are friendly and courteous, we had a nice conversation and I got to practice my Spanish quite a bit  I recommend this place highly and I am giving it two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Hhhhmmm satisfied my craving for Mexican food. The place doesn't do justice though. This really is a hidden gem. Literally. It's tucked away in a quiet street in Scarborough. You can tell it's a small family restaurant because they're just all present, the whole family chipping away in the kitchen.  We ordered the guacamole, Acapulco combo (burrito and enchilada), cheese quesadilla, and a big beef burrito. My gosh. Those were some big servings! The guacamole was very good but wanted more lime or cilantro. The chips were freshly fried because they were still warm. The combo was very filling. Mostly all items come with rice, refried beans, and a salad. The cheese quesadilla was very cheesy and straightforward. No extra surprise flavours which we really enjoyed. The burrito was massive! Almost as big as a bicep!   Service was nice and warm. Again, a family feel. The only thing is the place. It's a really small place. And it filled up really quickly. Good thing we got a seat.   Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"More like a 2.5. This plaza is an odd gem, lacking in any visual appeal. But tucked away in the back corner is this place. Came here for lunch on a Sunday around 1pm, there was another table of 2 there. It is a very small place only 4-5 tables with CP24 playing on a small tv, and the heat blasting in winter which makes it toasty because every time the door opens the place is so small you feel the wind. The guy behind the counter was nice and friendly. The decor is minimal and the tables and chairs are basic.   Each table got a small basket of chips and salsa which was a good snack, the salsa was a bit bland and lacked any heat. I got the tabasco combo which came with a chicken enchilada with green tomatillo sauce and a beef burrito with a red tomato sauce. The food was good but it felt more tex mex with the bagged shredded cheese, sour cream, and shredded lettuce salad. It was lacking the punch and depth of flavours that usually come with mexican food. But the corn tortillas and refried beans it came with was very good.   Its a good place for a quick, cheap lunch but I was hoping for more authentic mexican. But the portions were big and I left full. I'll come back next time and try the mole, hopefully that would be better"}
{"text":"We live in the area, my daughter and I are hooked, my husband too! Great food, great service and the home made salsa is delish!"}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch there. It is a welcoming restaurant in a nondescript strip mall. It is decorated in an abundant and colourful manner with Mexican items.  The menu is fairly inclusive. I was surprised that there were no lunch specials....Just on menu.  For starters I had the house salad which was plentiful and tasty. The only off-putting not was that instead of using queso blanco they use feta in all their dishes. This alone is costing a 1/2 a star. The Feta just did not work.  I had a burrito as a main course and it was fresh, well prepared, and tasty. The mexican rice and the re-fried beans were just that; nothing special.  The service is prompt and friendly, but for lunch it was on the pricey side.  I am giving it 4 stars because I can't give it 3.5 stars. I will return and try out some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Couldn't believe that we found an authentic Mexican resto right smack in the middle of Scarborough East! The fish tacos were great ( the white  fish  could use a  bit more seasoning though) and came with  some Mexican rice, a bit of green salad and refried beans. You had a choice of soft and hard taco too. My son ordered a kid's chicken burrito which was a good sized one. Service was fast and friendly considering they were also  servicing an ever streaming takeout line. I hope they expand as seating is so limited. The fried ice cream for dessert us to die for ! Perfect for sharing. Don't leave without trying it. Better than anything you can get it a gourmet restaurant! This place is a return-to..."}
{"text":"I was craving Mexican food, so I decided to try this place out and was satisfied! For my meal, I ordered a beef chimichanga, which came with rice, lettuce, and refried beans on the side, and it was very tasty! I was so full by the time I was finished, that I could barely move. I also ordered the nachos, but I wouldn't say that they stand out. I'm definitely going to come back and try some other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Amazing food all at reasonable pricing! I wouldn't recommend this place for dine in as the location is quite small and a little worn out as well as during the winter the place gets so cold due to its size. For take out the value and taste is unbeatable! Friendly staff as well which is always nice and they even provided us with chips while waiting for our food for dine in."}
{"text":"3.5 stars had the fish tacos which came w/ rice, salad, and refried beans  I enjoyed the fish tacos  fillet was seasoned well & shell was crunchy sides were average   not sure if I can just get the tacos next time  didn't see that option on their menu...they were all combos and owner was very nice; offered me tortilla chips w/ salsa while I waited"}
{"text":"Came for lunch last week and it was great! Really big portions and quick service. I didn't try their sangria but saw it at another table; it makes me want to come back to try some more!"}
{"text":"How happy am I to have a good Mexican place in my town and around the corner from me. Dudes - I can bike there!  Homemade tortilla chips and salsa - yum! Chorizo chimichanga - yum! Burritos, enchiladas, mole, etc - yum!  Mexico Lindo is very popular and gets packed. Also, upon walking in, you almost feel like you've made a pit stop off a Mexican road.   I do wish they had my favourite dessert - Tres Leches. Ah well!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday evening after a Toronto FC match.  Along Danforth, among all the Greek restaurants, we came across Mexico Lindo.  The Mexican themed environment was warm, cozy and welcoming.  Our server was very friendly and the overall service was great! For beginners we shared their Molletes Cancun for beginners, much like an Italian Bruschetta, but only Mexican, packed with tomatoes, beans, meat topped off with some cheese, this was a great starter.   Enchiladas suizas for my main, two giant corned tortillas stuffed with your choice of meats served with re-fried beans and salad, indeed flavorful. The portions were sufficient and I actually had to take some of it home.  To wash things down I opted for Mexico's popular beer... NO not Dos Equis, but rather Tecate!  Overall we both had an enjoyable experience! ole!"}
{"text":"Food is a \"5\" for sure!  The owner is very friendly and helpful and this is a great authentic Mexican restaurant.  The only issues are limited seating and the fact that on my last visit they weren't using credit card service. In fairness, don't miss out on this hidden gem. (It really is a hidden gem in that it's situated in the corner of a small strip mall in Scarborough. It might take a minute to find it, but it is well worth the search!)"}
{"text":"I liked that there was a choice of wheat or corn tortillas, and of soft or hard corn ones.   The only choice for a gf vegan was the veggie enchilada. There are tacos on the menu but they called to say they don't make them because they turn out too soggy. So, enchiladas for me.   They came with a side of rice, pur√©ed beans, and iceberg lettuce salad.   I paid $8.50 for a side of guacamole, which was good, but seemed quite expensive.   The food was ok, but honestly enchiladas filled with corn is a bit of a ripoff besides being GMO full and not the best choice. How about onions zucchini red pepper? Or cactus?   Perhaps they make 5 star meat offerings, but the vegan choice leaves a little to be desired. Something to work on."}
{"text":"One of our favourite places!! Order anything and you will be happy! Great Service,  Decor awesome, maybe it is the margarita talking :)"}
{"text":"A great find on my travels to the Oshawa/Whitby area for work.  The prices are great, food was awesome and authentic. Our server was attentive and fast with our requests. I got the beef chimichanga and chorizo enchilada.  I'd recommend getting the guacamole as well."}
{"text":"Been there a few times. Never disappointed in anyway. Only once...they ran out of Guacamole, but that was 8:15pm. I always go with their combo. A beef burrito and a chicken enchilada served with rice, beans and salad. - $15.95. Sangria - $6.95. And finish off with the Deep Fried Ice Cream - $8. And recently I found out they have an Express located in Scarborough. Will try that later on."}
{"text":"At first glance it does not look like much, but looks are deceiving. This is straight up authentic Mexican food.  Pure awesomeness in my mouth!   We were the only people in here, and I was a little hesitant at first. Then, the food came out! It was awesome.   There are a 3 signs when I go to a Mexican restaurant that I look for----I'll Tell you them: 1.It has to have real Mexican cheese of some sort. Chihuahua Cheese is my fav. 2. I need to see Verde----like truly good tasting tomitillo homeade sauce. 3. I need a Steak Taco! A good flank steak taco can not be beat.  This place knocked them out of the park!   Also they brought a nice mixed Mexican veggie bowl that I really did appreciate. It was fresh cactus along with a pico. Totally unexpected and awesome.   To really push my in love with this place, I was handed a free piece of cake on my walk out the door filled with fresh strawberries! I almost gave the waitress a hug I was so excited!  Great true Mexican food in Madison!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! For $10 you get one chimichanga, one enchilada, beans, rice and salad! Everything was made fresh, tasted authentic and the best part, the service is amazing. We had horchata to drink which was delicious too!! Highly recommended and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, was yelled at by the head cook when we asked if take out was available because he was too busy and its not worth his time for a small order. His words.  Avoid this place, much better options \"Mariachi\" on Yonge street 2 mins away.  Playa Cabana downtown."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that there is barely any authentic Latino food spots in North Scarborough, so after stumbling upon this restaurant around 8:45 on yelp tonight, my mom and I hurried on down to Mexico Lindo as we were craving something different.   We ordered the chorizo enchilada and the \"Cancun\" (burrito and seafood enchilada) to go. Both were ridiculously tasty. Also, not on the menu but a must try, is their Horchata ($3.50 for a gigantic cup). Lillian served us some delicious house made nachos while we waited for our food, and Lucia gave us some additional nachos to take home.   I've never been to Mexico, but I can honestly say their food is as close to LA style Mexican food that you can get in Scarborough.   The hospitality here is unreal. Lillian and Lucia are absolute gems. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This has become my new favorite location! I have been to the one on Bayview which happens to be his brother in-law's location.   From the street you can not see the restaurant. It is hidden in a plaza, in a corner. A true hidden gem!  Super friendly and happy to see every face that comes into the restaurant. There is limited seating however but I have not had a problem getting a table!   Complimentary chips and salsa, for a small place the food sure does come out fast! I also love the traditional Mexican drink.  Looking for authentic Mexican dishes, then come spot into Mexico LIndo!"}
{"text":"I am always looking for a good authentic Mexican restaurant and this place is now on the top of my charts!   I went here on a Saturday night and the place was full! I also took the Mexicans eating at this place and the previous reviews on Yelp as a good sign.  The owner is super friendly and being in this restaurant made me feel like I was home, in my second life, Acapulco.  The strawberry daiquiri was delicious! The portions are very generous and the chicken chimichanga hit the spot! But make sure you leave room for dessert.  I love deep fried ice cream, and alot of times the outside just isn't nice but the deep fried ice cream here was so perfect! Just thinking about the food here is making my mouth water!  I am not even a fan of refried beans but the ones here are sooooo delicious!   I can't wait to come back, maybe I will go there tonight! What are you waiting for, I will meet you there!"}
{"text":"Taco salad, how do I love ye? Let me count the ways: tender pieces of chicken, delicious taco toppings, addictive taco-shelled bowl. With a pineapple Jarrito (Mexican sody pop) on the side, that's a delicious lunch right there!  I've also had the enchilada (regular and suiza, which is covered with melted cheese) and the burritos....fam, all the food here is pretty darn tasty. But for me, it's taco salad for the win.  Bonus: they have a stack of sombreros for all your sombrero-selfie needs :)"}
{"text":"I've been to two of the other locations and this is the biggest and the best.  food was made with  love and they accommodate large parties and great take out.  food does not come out quick so don't rush them, but deep flavors.  they either raised their prices or this location just charge a bit more, but it's worth it.  Best Mexican in Ajax"}
{"text":"There are series of \"Mexico Lindo\" restaurants throughout Durham Region, all a little different. Someone once told me that they're all owned by cousins or some other family connection, but each does things a little differently. Of all of them, I think this one is my favourite. The service is prompt and very friendly, good portion sizes and delicious offerings, and you can almost forget you're in a non-descript strip mall of no particular import.   We went with a craving for tacos and had a great meal. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Finding decent Mexican around here is far from easy - but Mexico Lindo is a solid offering. It kind of feels like it's in the middle of nowhere, but the trip is worth it. Food is delicious, well spiced, generously portioned, and the service is friendly. Overall it or its sister (in Ajax) are great stops. I seem to recall hearing that the various restaurants in Durham of similar names are related, but not a chain or franchise, each is a little different."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. We used to come to the one in Bomanville all the time after race days at Mosport, but it closed down. :( luckily the family keeps this one running and it's down the street in Whitby! The lady at the helm is fantastic, authentic and so funny and sweet. The food is delicious and we'll priced for the portions. Chips and salsa are fresh (ask for hotsuace for the salsa) and the specials are on the white board as you walk in. . . .not in the menu! So look before you sit. XOXO love these people!  Oh! And get the fried ice cream!  :)"}
{"text":"The food here was decent, large portions and lots of options, but not the best Mexican I've had.  The service however was warm and friendly and I loved the vibe of the place, which felt cozy and authentic.   The chips and salsa before the meal were great (the chips at least...the salsa was just okay in my opinion).  We also ordered guacamole, chicken enchiladas and a chorizo chimichanga. Of those I'd say the chimichanga was the best. Wish everything had a touch more flavour. Timing could also be improved (dishes came out one at a time).  They also have a kids menu here, which is great. Portions are generous for both adults and kids. The kids meal we ordered - quesadilla with a side of fries - was huge.  Not sure if I'll be back, but if you're in the area and looking for an inexpensive, filling meal, check this place out."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem!  My fav place in Scarborough!  the portions are big.  value versus quality is on point, super duper!  I tried their chimicanga and quesadillas and love them!  Since those are my favs I always tend to order then same thing.  Yum Yum Yum!  a must must must must must try!  its CHEAP & AWESOME!  They have traditional mexican drinks that aren't on the menu, but you can always just ask for the owner ^_^  staff is friendly too!  Place is very authentic."}
{"text":"Very good and authentic Mexican food. Not Tex Mex-y at all. Huge portions, too.  We ordered the chicken enchiladas and chorizo tacos. Both came with rice and refried beans. The tacos were overflowing with delicious Mexican chorizo, and the enchiladas with salsa verde were perfect.   The house hot sauce was super spicy but delicious.   The server was very friendly and prompt. We'd definitely go back next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"My wife Sara never knew she loved Mexican food until we started eating here.  My daughter loves it too.  They have the most delicious, savory fajitas I have had anywhere.  My favourite dish is the Tobacco - very flavourful and hearty serving size.  This is a family business, nice to see the owners taking pride in their cooking!"}
{"text":"Worked up an appetite while shopping at Fairview and stumbled upon this little place on Yelp. 4 Stars, 112 reviews - can't lose I thought.   Located in a small strip mall, this little gem is easy to miss.   Ordered the fish tacos (3 for 9.99) and the Mexican combo.  Everything was absolutely amazing.   Service was super friendly and I'd have to say, top three tacos I've had in TO."}
{"text":"Mexico Lindo serves up delicious home-style Mexican food. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who wants to experience the closest thing to authentic Mexican dining within Durham Region.  On this particular visit, we ordered a taco salad to share as an appetizer (the deep-fried bowl that it comes in is SO good), a chicken chimichanga, and a chicken quesadilla. On top of this, they also provide you with complimentary chips and homemade salsa. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals and it kept us sustained for the entire rest of the night. The flavours are impeccable and definitely taste like homemade recipes!  Upon arrival, you will find that the atmosphere is colourful and festive which only adds to the dining experience. The service is quick and straight-to-the-point, which I enjoyed for that type of atmosphere. I was also happy to discover that they do take-out! I will definitely be back one day to try more of their delicious selections :)"}
{"text":"If your looking for good authentic Mexican food and your in Scarborough you gotta to to Mexico lindo. It's my go to place for Mexican I can finally say I found a legit place in my area to get Mexican food. I have been here many times and not one bad experience at all.   If you want to try a little bit of everything I recommend the Mexican combo it comes with chimichanga, enchiladas. I usually get the tacos each order comes with three and we can choose between beef, chicken, chorizo, vegetable and pull pork, you can mix and match. You can also choose hard or soft taco with corn or flour tacos. Everything comes with rice, beans and salad. Very good value.  There not much tables so you might need to take out. Very friendly family owned restaurant. You should give it a try!"}
{"text":"Just checked out this place last week as my girlfriend was craving some Mexican food. We ordered fish tacos and chorizo enchiladas suiza and also a horchata to share (a rice based drink with milk, sugar and cinnamon that I actually really liked).  The fish in the tacos were quite tasty, but were kind of dry. I was a bigger fan of the enchiladas suiza. And a huge fan of the horchata. Price is around $10-15/meal.  Will probably return to give some of their other items a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food. Comfortable and casual atmosphere. The mojito was refreshing and not too sweet. Our table ordered 3 combos (sorry, can't remember what they were called) but all were delish!! Only down side was they didn't have any guacamole. BUT it should be noted that the reason for this was because the avocados were not good that day. So I appreciate them not serving something sub par.   We had a total of 4 people for dinner and it was everyone's first visit and we will all be back.   A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden gem in Scarborough! Right when we walked in, you can tell this place is authentic! Best Mexican I've had in the GTA hands down, and may even top some of the food I've had at local restaurants in Mexico.   I'm a sucker for anything tamarind, so I was pleased to try their tamarind Mexican drink! Very tasty! I had their daily special which was a beef chimichanga and a chicken empanada served with salad, refried beans and rice for only $10.95. Even though this is more of a take out place, we ate in and loved how they cared enough to have warm plates!   All and all, a new go to for Mexican!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food! Great price and friendly, quick service. I eat here almost every weekend. A must try!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican Restaurants I have been in. The waitress is very courteous and very polite. It took a little while for the servers to take the orders and the food came a little slow nonetheless, the service is very good (it could have been the fact that the food just took a little longer to prepare)  The meal comes with complementary nachos and dips which is really good and subdue the hunger. The food in the restaurant is very tasty. You will not be disappointed......ever!!  The quality of food and service has remained very consistent and good over the years. I definitely recommend the place.  Don't let the location of the place throw you off. It's a hidden gem in Ajax."}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted warmly by the owner who then answered all our questions and gave us some chips and salsa while we perused the menu. Ordered the Cancun plate, which consists of a seafood burrito and seafood enchilada in a mild red sauce served with rice, refried beans and salad made up of iceberg lettuce, corn, black beans, red onion, tomatoes, red pepper and queso fresco, and the calamari sonrientes which is served with a mild red sauce and rice.  All the food was well made and flavorful without being salty or abusively spicy. I'll definitely be returning to try out their tacos and other offerings."}
{"text":"Pros:  The chicken enchiladas with green tomatillo sauce were amazing! Two small  tortillas (corn, i think) with a delicious sauce, cheese and sour cream. It was very filling with all the meat inside. The side of beans and rice that came with my enchiladas were nice, too and for $10.95, the price is fair. I'm picky with enchiladas and these are the best I've had in Toronto since Mexitaco changed their recipe and  started blasting loud Latin rap videos.  The complimentary chips are served hot, fresh and paper thin. They come with a tasty red sauce (although I would have preferred a pico de gallo).   The sangria was deeeelicious and would be great to enjoy on their small, shaded patio on a hot summer day. The server was really nice, too.   Cons:  DON\"T ORDER THE GUACAMOLE! It was terrible. And I love guacamole. My friend and I agreed it seemed they added mayo to it. It just didn't taste right and it cost $8, which is a lot of money since it seemed they maybe used half an avocado. Once again, no pico de gallo on top. Not very traditional from what I've had in Mexico, anyway.  We were too  polite to send it back.   Also, I didn't care for the salad dressing and it's very dark inside the restaurant.   I think I would go back because it's so close to home, but I'm still searching for a really amazing Mexican place in Toronto."}
{"text":"It truly is 3.5 stars, but I round it up to 4 stars because it is conveniently located in North Toronto.  Not needing to drive to St Clair and downtown for good Mexican food is worthy of 0.5 for this uptowner.  Mexico Lindo sells basic Mexican food, such as tacos, burrito, enchilada, pozole, guacamole, etc..  Its main selling point is freshness.  We ordered a pulled pork enchilada and a beef taco, both came with a side salad, Mexican rice and refried beans.  The pulled pork was tasty and juicy without bathing in sauce.  The beef was well marinated.  The Mexican rice was tasty and cooked just right (way better than Made in Mexico's mushy rice).   The salad was very fresh.  The refried beans could be slightly less diluted, but it had a kick to it, so I enjoyed it.  Everything tasted authentic Mexican.  Nothing seemed oily or greasy.  The gentleman behind the counter was friendly, enthusiastic and efficient in services.  Mexico Lindo is a hole in a wall, the best kind.  I have bookmarked it for repeated visits."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I had fish enchiladas that were filling and yummy. My friend had the taco salad. A great place for lunch. Small though...be prepared you may need to take out!"}
{"text":"Was looking for another authentic Mexican place to compare with where I've been recently and the closeness and overall positive rating I found here on Yelp lead me here. Other places looked nicer and were certainly larger, but so far this is the best Mexican place I've tried (shoot me a recommend if you have one). Tiny place, I've been to this strip mall several times and never noticed that it was here. Really good portions for the price.  Really liked the rice and salad, bean paste was... meh. Tried a chicken Quesadilla (sp?), it was good, real good.  Another place that will be seeing more check ins from me in the future. Did I mention tiny?  Only a handful of tables so depending on how busy they get you might want to plan on take out."}
{"text":"Joanne L. suggested this place to me as I was looking for something inexpensive. We were greeted when we entered and given menus to look at. The service was just as friendly the whole time we were there from start to finish!   They give you a small portion of nachos and salsa while you wait, which we appreciated. The salsa is light with a little bit of a kick to it and some of the nachos were still quite warm.  The portions here are massive - neither of us finished our meals. Both meals came with salad, refried beans, and rice. The salad was good - tangy and lightly dressed with tomatoes, pepper, and a bit of corn and cilantro. The refried beans I didn't eat much of as it was quite dense. it had a rich flavor but it was a little too rich and salty. The rice was flavorful without being very salty as well.  My pulled pork quesadilla was quite large and there was a generous amount of pork and cheese inside. The whole meal cost $10. It's not the most tender pulled pork I've had but it was decent and had a good taste to it without being too salty. The whole meal was delicious without being too heavy and I didn't leave feeling like my mouth was really dry because of all the salt.  There is limited seating but this place does takeout orders as well. It was mostly empty while we were there. At most places the art is just there to fill the walls but here the art is also fun to look at while you wait with lots of hidden things in the pictures. We'll definitely come again for the great value, service, and food that we received."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican restaurant in the heart of Scarborough. Great food with a mom and pops restaurant feel."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican restaurant. Its a very small place with seating capacity of about ten people. Service can be slow at times if its busy but overall this time around it was pretty decent. Saw a few customers order takeout.  I've never seen more than two people working at a time and the gentleman serving us was very friendly. I liked how he called me Amigo :)  Meal comes with nacho chips and tomato sauce dip.  Carne al Quezillo - basically a Mexican style steak with rice, salad and brown bean paste for $15.95. this was not what I was expecting when I ordered it but it still tasted very good. Of course you can get better steaks elsewhere but for a way higher price.  Chicken burrito - this dish was served with the same rice, salad and brown bean paste for $9.95. Chicken chunks were huge.  A very nice meal overall"}
{"text":"Checked out this place while browsing the Danforth and was not disappointed! We had the chimichangas and they were fantastic. Service was fast and the staff was very friendly, will deffintly be returning and telling people about this place!"}
{"text":"Great legit Mexican food, this is the only place your going to find it in Scarborough.   Pro tip - Get the Burrito with the salad, beans and rice on the side."}
{"text":"Homemade family style catering, I was welcome instantly by the owner himself when I walk through that. He handed a menu to me and answered my questions. I ordered a chorizo burrito with salad and rice on the side. While waiting, he offered nachos on the house asked if I wanted drinks. As I was about to pay, he said that it was not necessary until I finished my meal. The food was awesome (although the chorizo could be less salty) and one of the best Mexican food I've tasted so far in Canada. I definitely plan on returning."}
{"text":"Came in a 8 to order 3 tacos for takeout, I didn't receive my order until 8:45. In hindsight, after 20 minutes I should of cancelled the order and left. Wasn't offered any water or chips while waiting so I missed all the hospitality everyone else received in these reviews. When the order arrived, I received a smile and a sorry.   I have a soft spot to for family owned businesses, but I can't bring myself to go back after this.   In summary: Didn't enjoy my experience The food did not make up for it"}
{"text":"Came here on a cold Saturday night with my wife. Tip: Come hungry because the portions are big! The service was very prompt and friendly. Lots of great authentic Mexican menu choices to choose from. I had a combination meal with enchiladas and a burrito. Food was absolutely fantastic, tasty and rightfully spicy. If you're looking for a trendy hipster place, then this is not the place for you. This is just great Mexican food with no pretensions and at very reasonable cost. Great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Wow, outstanding!!!This tastes like Mexico, the authentic home cooked stuff. I'm typing as I eat. The enchiladas are terrific, the refried beans have a lovely smoky flavour. The portions are huge. Yes I am coming back here and bringing the wife.  Oh and the diablo sauce is actually hot."}
{"text":"This place has been bookmarked for awhile and I finally had the chance to try out this local restaurant located in Scarborough. This is a takeout and dine in restaurant - very casual.  After ordering at the counter, they offer complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was so thin and watered down - no flavour whatsoever. I would have rather opted to not have it at all.   I ordered the Chorizo Quesadilla which comes with beans, rice and salad. There are two sauces on dish but both were bland and lacking any taste. My sister ordered the Chicken Burrito which comes with the same sides, again it was bland and quite disappointing. I'm flabbergasted as to how this place has 4/5 stars when there are other places that taste so much better. Maybe it was an off day but this is not my first time having Mexican food.   Sure the price is on point and portion is decent but quality and taste needs improvement.   I'm sorry but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences of my life . Hubby and I went there a week ago based on yelp reviews . We walk in and were ignored to be seated for like 10 Minutes that should have been the sign but against the advise of my hubby I insisted to wait then the waitress finally seated us . Decor of the place is kinda cheapish but I thought who cares if the food is good. My husband ordered beer which 3 options weren't available so he opted with what was available. We ordered nachos to start they came without jalape√±os and the waitress even made a comment like oh no jalape√±os came oh well!!  The nachos were ok nothing to brag about . Then we wanted to order shrimp fajita for two and she said they Are out of shrimps weird.. So we ordered chicken and beef fajita for two . When it was finally served half an hour later I couldn't beleive it .. a small tray of sour cream and cheese and 3 fajitas was that suppose to be enough for both of us ?? The worst is that the chicken and beef were not edible so we didnt bother I was so livid at that point we just went up to the counter paid and left . Never will we ever return ."}
{"text":"Like Mexican food?    Well this is as authentic as you are going to get in Whitby.  The food was very tasty, the portion sizes are insane (good thing), and the staff is very personable.  If you want it a bit spicier, then opt for the Diablo sauce on the side.  Not offered on the menu, but it is apparently the way to go.  The hot sauce packs some heat as well as flavour.     The place is much larger than one would expect from the outside.  If the place looks busy, still give it a chance, there will be room."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday - the staff were extremely welcoming, including the owner who came out to chat with us. The cocktails were huge (I needed two hands to pick up my daiquiri) and most importantly, the food was FANTASTIC. It's a new family favourite now and my cousin recently went for his birthday and also loved it :)"}
{"text":"Came on a weeknight with a group of 3 people. There was no wait, but some one was there for take out. The restaurant is very tiny, maybe only 8 tables so alo tof ppl order take out. I've been here many times, but i think the boss changed. the food tastes somewhat the same. still has free chips while you wait for your food though.   there aren't many Mexican restaurants in Scarborough, this one is a Gem. Make sure to come with an empty belly, the portion sizes are generous. the only down fall is the seating, other then that, its my go to Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The horchata is good it's unbelievable. The taste is just amazing. Also the churros are fried at just the perfect temperature and absolutely delicious. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This is a newly opened restaurant at the southwest corner of Birchmount Road and Huntingwood, just south of Finch Ave.  I had been noticing the \"opening soon\" signs for months and finally, it has opened! My coworker and I decided to try it out for lunch today.  We walked into this small Mexican sit-down/take-out restaurant situated in the corner of the plaza.  There were a couple of people ahead of us making large orders and we noticed three people in total working in the kitchen and at the front of the house. We placed our order and sat down to wait. After several minutes, our chorizo chimichangas came out and we were served with salad, guacamole, refried beans, and rice in a separate container. The food was delicious! The chimichanga was slightly greasy, but of course, that was due to the chorizo sausage and the fact that it was fried, but the flavours were great and so was the value ($9.95 plus tax).   The service was also very good and the owners seem to be working very hard. However, it appears that they need to work on organizing and working more efficiently because we didn't end up paying for our meal until after we had finished it because they were so busy taking orders from other customers that trickled in after us.  I would definitely come back here to try some of their other items, such as the enchiladas, burritos, and churros!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the longweekend driving home from up north. Food was ok. I might eat here again just to avoid eating at big box chains in the area. Had Chorizo that tasted like ground beef, was spicy but not a lot of flavour. The salad dressing tasted like Kraft straight out of the bottle. Service was friendly and fast. The place was clean."}
{"text":"Foods - taste good. Hot. Generous portion. Price - decent. Good deal. Service - friendly and  helpful staff Atmospher - family run restaurant. Causal.   I will definitely go back soon"}
{"text":"First off get their tortilla chips with their homemade salsa everything is made fresh in the restaurant. I can tell from the vibe that i was in mexico and the food was going to be really authentic. I got the beef taco, enchilada with beans and an orange color rice. It is absolutely  delicious.  The first bite melts in your mouth. Extremely friendly owners and very respectful that is what first attracts me to the restaurant is how they greet you and their customer service even if the food is good but the customer service is not then i probably won't come back. The owners are one of the nicest people i met. Compared to the food when i went in Cancun this place beats mexico out of the park. They need to fix their website though because i think that will attract a lot more customers not living in that area. The tacos are a billion times better than taco bell, hands down. I will come back here for a long time, guaranteed just because the owners and staff were really kind and they treat you like family when you go to their restaurant."}
{"text":"Tired of going eating either boring chinese or Indian food in scarborough....finally a new selection where I can get some authentic mexican food....it's a small place located in a somewhat ethnic plaza that has chinese, viet, greek and caribbean food....it's a mom and pop store where the owner greeted us 'hi amigos' upon entering   A lot of selection, most of the meals come with salad, fried beans and dirty rice all at reasonable price that won't break the bank...got the chiorzo enchiladas that was very cheesy and filling....also got the taco where you get 3 tacos with any meat of ur choice, pulled pork was a little salty, chicken was the best, you also get a free started chip n salsa  Will come back"}
{"text":"Love this place. Amazing food, drinks, staff and prices. Have takenultiole friends here and they have all loved it too. Tried so many Mexican places in Toronto and am so happy I found this place (well a friend introduced me and I've been going ever since)    If you're looking for some authentic Mexican with great portions and prices, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight and was really pleasantly surprised with the whole experience.  The food was really great, and the price made it even better. I got enchiladas; they were really tasty, not super greasy, and the portion size was big.   Our server was friendly and pretty attentive considering she was alone during the dinner rush.  If you're looking for some sleek modern decor, go somewhere else because this place has more of a family restaurant/low key vibe.   All in all, a great place to go for generous portion sizes, good prices, and a chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Having just moved from Texas to Toronto, we were excited to see this place close to the house - but the food was a real disappointment. Even the salsa seemed to come from a can."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, and service. I recommend either the Camarones mojo Al Ajo (garlic) or the fajitas."}
{"text":"Delicious, reasonably priced, MASSIVE portions and super friendly service. Best burrito I've had in Toronto. If you are in the area I would definitely recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"I would eat here every day if I could. It's unbelievably delicious and feels like home cooked comfort food.   This is not tex mex, but rather real Mexican food.  Everyone is friendly and if you're brave ask them about their various hot sauces."}
{"text":"In short: great food, amazing prices, and  friendly staff.  Ordered a Chimichanga and a Burrito for $9.95 each, came with rice, beans, and salad as well as your choice of filling from beef, chicken, chorizo, vegetables, or pulled pork. Although this is a take out restaurant, there are a few tables so we ate on site. The portions were huge and they are not stingy on the filling either. This place is run by the same family who runs the various other Mexico Lindo restaurants (Bayview/ Eglinton, Whitby, etc). I highly recommend this place if you're looking for delicious, large, authentic Mexican meals for cheap prices!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try as it had really good reviews and we happened to be in the area.  This plaza seems to have a ton of very authentic Taiwanese, carribean, Vietnamese and Mexican food... I will def. be back to try other things in the area.  I ordered the pulled pork big burrito ($7.95) and my fianc√© got the daily special (chicken & steak, comes with salad, refried beans and rice). The burrito was definitely better than the wet tacos.  I wouldn't say the portions are massive, but they were definitely enough. The staff are very friendly and we were given chips & salsa while waiting for our food."}
{"text":"real fresh mexican food, for the same price you would pay for taco bell you can get a full healthy authentic mexican meal  5/5 stars the owner is great and takes pride in his food"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! It's a hole in the wall but man, they make truly authentic Mexican dishes! Their nachos are super tasty. Their tacos are to die for... service is always top notch! What a gem! You must try their enchilada and taco dishes! They are located in this random plaza, but that plaza is full of food food!"}
{"text":"The service is slow here, but that's because they pay attention to details! I appreciated how \"built\" my burrito was, with crispy edges all around. My girlfriend got the \"Tabasco\" combo, which was a chicken chimichanga and a beef burrito served with rice, refridd beans, and salad. It wasn't spicy at all, but tasted good nonetheless. Came as a large portion that I had to help her finish! For myself, I got a chorizo burrito and the sausage was a lot saltier than I expected, but I would definitely come back and my review would likely go to five stars if I find a menu item I fall in love with."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was amazing, they were super polite. I had the enchiladas and the spices were on a good level. Would definitely recommend.  PS. +1 star if there's wifi"}
{"text":"Growing up my view of Mexican food was limited by Taco Bell's interpretation of Mexican food...Hard and soft tacos, bean burritos and anything else off the value menu.  Yes, I admit it I had a very deprived childhood!  Mexico Lindo is located in a great foodie plaza at Birchmount and Hungtingwood.  To clarify there's a bunch of other places called Mexico Lindo throughout the GTA but I'm not sure if they are all related in anyway as the set ups all look different.  Its a bit of a dive but let's admit it, some of the best food are not found in super expensive places but the most ghetto dives around.    Serving authentic and delicious fare from burritos, enchiladas, tacos, etc.. its a great gem of Mexican food in the part of the city where good Latin food is really hard to find.  Portions are large and prices are reasonable with prices from $10-$15 per entree and burritos around $8.  The place is more of a take out place but there are a few tables for a sit down meal.  No need to \"run for the border\" to get a good Mexican meal especially if Trump gets his way building that darn wall:).  A solid 4/5 from me!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and have been here a few times. Their food is authentic and fresh and great portions sizes. Prices are fair and and service is fast as I usually get food to go."}
{"text":"An authentic Mexican restaurant - in WHITBY!?!? It sounds crazy, but it's true. This restaurant used to be an old gas station or something that I'd pass on my way to the old record store I used to work at, but it's been turned into this apparently extremely popular restaurant, right in the middle of suburbia.   The prices are reasonable and the service is very quick as they like to get people in and out so they can feed as many as they can on a busy night. The food is great - they offer favorites like enchiladas and tacos with healthy sides of beans and rice.   It's very nice to find a restaurant in Whitby that isn't a chain!"}
{"text":"My new favourite place. The food was absolutely amazing. Very hard to pick from the menu as everything looked and sounded so good. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good food, good selection of Mexican beers.  Being of Mexican descent, I've been disappointed in Mexican restaurants out in the suburbs, but this one gets my vote"}
{"text":"DO NOT order a margarita on the rocks....  It tasted like lime kool-aid mixed with tequila.  Not authentic.  The food was OK, but the service left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Delicious. The number one takeaway from this restaurant was \"fresh\". Freshly made guacamole (served right in the mortar and pestle it was prepared in), freshly made tortilla chips, fresh rice, refried beans, and tender chicken and well-seasoned beef.   I had their \"Tobasco\" combo - a beef burrito in red sauce, and a chicken enchilada in tomatillo sauce. The latter sauce was flavourful and delicious.  We were served by Alexa, who recommended us several items and was a great host. Their diablo hot sauce was also excellent.   Definitely our new weeknight Mexican spot."}
{"text":"I was skeptical when I was outside because it was a small restaurant in a random parking lot. When debating whether or not to go in, the employee saw us at the window and handed me a take-out menu. Upon scanning it, I went in and he promptly cleaned all the tables around me.   We got the guacamole to start which came with fresh, hot chips. I observed the cook in the kitchen mashing fresh avocados. The guac was creamy, delicious, and came with salsa on the side!   I ordered the fish tacos and my companion ordered a chicken enchilada and burrito as our mains. The portions are HUGE! I was impressed because all the flavours were perfect. The refried beans were so tasty paired with a small salad AND rice. I could barely finish the 3 tacos on my plate. The fish was breaded and deep fried to a crispy perfection.   Best of all, the service was exceptional. My server seemed genuinely interested in whether we were enjoying the food, and asked how each item tasted. He was attentive and eager to please. The prices are also unbeatable! I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Quality food for a reasonable price. The staff is very friendly and the service is top notch. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So good ! If you are looking for a place for nice decor and atmosphere this is not the place for you. They have great food at good prices ! Portions are huge. Recommend the enchiladas pulled pork !"}
{"text":"This place was one of the most authentic Mexican food places i've had! The portions are generous, the prices are reasonable, and the staff are so kind. It's in a pretty bland plaza; the place has 4-5 small tables so it's a bit more of a takeout place.  We had taco salads that were huge and delicious, and also ordered an horchada (not on the menu). Wish we had room for fried ice cream and churros! I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My standard for what a taco should be are the street vendors in Guadalajara, which I have had every year for the past 20 years. They are small, perhaps only 4 inches in diameter, doubled up corn tortilla, and your choice of chorizo, pastor, tripe, suadero, and other meats. They are then topped off with a fresh salsa made of raw onions, cilantro, and a wedge of lime.  Then you take your plate to the salsa bar to pour on your choice of mild to spicy salsa sauce.  Squeeze lime over all tacos and enjoy.  This was not that. It really was nothing more than bad tex mex. First, no lime, no onions, no cilantro, and not very hot in temperature. It was more like a restaurant version of the store bought El Paso taco kit with lettuce and cheese. I have never had Mexican tacos w/ either lettuce or cheese. That's something the American's did, I think.  Gosh, I really wanted to like this place as it's close to my home and the owner is so friendly.  And...why did some folks get what looked like a complementary starter bowl of tortas and salsa, but not us?    So the search continues for a \"real\" taco place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Got the fajitas, which of course came out sizzling on a hot plate. Tasted great! The place was pretty quiet when I went (Saturday afternoon), but I liked the ambiance."}
{"text":"disappointed...the entire family sits in the restaurant and eats...the food has no flavour  the one in oshawa is ten times better"}
{"text":"I had a craving for Mexican and came here (ie. Yelp) to figure out what we could do, because there is a very real lack of good Mexican food in Toronto. This place had some good reviews and wasn't too far away from us, so off we went.  Parking in Leaside can be pretty brutal, but we finally found a space and luckily, street parking is free.   The restaurant is tacky, stereotypical, but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated.   The menu has basic Mexican fare, burritos, fajitas, tacos, with your choice of meat. Nothing too outside of the box, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.   We ordered the guacamole to start and I ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga.   The guacamole is very delicious and creamy, but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough. We were really loading up the chips with the guacamole!   The food came out and the was served with rice, a salad (sort of Italian dressing with feta and tomatoes) and refried beans. The salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland, but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice (I'm a wimp).   The appetizer and our main courses came to $30 and we were VERY full.   Service was good and food was good and it wasn't too expensive. It wasn't perfect, but we'll totally be back!"}
{"text":"In town on business, read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I agree the food was good, hot and fresh. The staff is friendly and the restaurant was clean. I had the dinner buffet for $12.99, so I had an assortment of food on my plate. Haven't figured out how to post pic from my new IPad."}
{"text":"Great food. Very friendly owner. The place is nothing fancy but the food is worth it. Prices are decent for what you get. I highly recommend the chimichanga."}
{"text":"Great chicken nuggets and fries, my mom always gets chicken salsa verde and she loves it"}
{"text":"Went here with my friend over the weekend... The place was cute and small.. I did not use the rest room however my friend did and said it wasn't a pleasant sight. The food was great, filled with flavour and it was a pretty hearty meal ! Service was okay. They give you some chips with salsa while you wait. I order nachos but I never got them, waited and waited to the point where I figured as long as he didn't charge us for it that's fine, so we didn't argue to get them made or anything, but that brought down the experience for sure . Nothing is worse than ordering something and it not coming out. I would still suggest to try the tacos and the enchiladas."}
{"text":"Great Mexican place. Small but the food is just amazing. They do a great job in the chicken. We have tried everything and love it. We keep coming back."}
{"text":"I've been there few times, food is authentic, chef is from Mexico as well.  I like to try the corn tortillas as they are healthier than flour. I've had the enchiladas, tacos, chimichangas, cancun salad. Tried almost everythting. Overall, great food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a buddy from work. I had the 3 tacos with salad rice and bean paste. The chorizo meat was very good in the tacos. Very reasonable prices for all meals. The guy serving was the owner believe and was super friendly. Highly recommend checking this location out. Small dine in space but it has great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Pretty good wet burrito! $8 and you get rice, beans and salad on the side with it. Got the pulled pork and it was really good.   Service was quick and they give you complimentary tortillas and salsa as you wait.   Not that many tables but quick turn over."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 3 times for take-out (one sit in). The food and service is great.  If you dine in they give you free chips/salsa but you can also ask for it while you are waiting for take-out.  I personally like the hard tacos but most of their other options taste great too.  Overall: Great owner and ideal for fast authentic Mexican food. Dine in space is nothing special and limited but is an option as well."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food with great friendly service. The place is small and was manned by one person when we went, but he was so efficient! I had fish tacos and they were delish. Portions were huge as well. Props to this mom and pop shop for staying in business for this long. If you're feeling like some Mexican, I would give them a visit for sure if you happen to be in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This restaurant is open!!! And it's delicious! The service from the owner was quick, top-notch and friendly. Honestly, it was one of the best burritos I've had in-town. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great food, unparalleled service, kind & jovial owner!  We drove all the way from Milton to Scarborough since I heard nothing but good word of mouth. And it was so worth it.  Complimentary nachos, cheesy spicy nachos, Spicy shrimp in red sauce, tachos and Chicken Enchiladas. Perrrrfect!  They have homemade spicy red and green sauce. Green sauce is made of Jalape√±os. I went so gaga about it that Lucia (owner) packed us some to take home. Whaaaaat!!!  She and her brothers feed hungry amigos all over GTA. I just hope the brothers are as kind, attentive and nice to their customers as Lucia was.   Amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Disappointed -- it's a shame, used to be great.   We've been going to Mexico Lindo for years, food had always been great, service had been great. Placed used to be packed. Today, dinner at 6:30 on a Sat night, more than half empty....same could be said for the plates now. Half the beans, rice and salad that used to come with the dish. We asked for the spicy salsa with the chips, never received it. Didn't even get our waters or drinks till after the food arrived, after we asked for it again.   My husband has the special -- the sirloin with the chorizo, he was asked mild or spicy. He asked for spicy, got mild.   It's a shame, used to be a great family run restaurant. Taking a break from here for sure. Hope they go back to the great food or service, otherwise I'm sure they'll lose more customers."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day and literally enjoyed every bite. I had the chicken enchiladas and they were very satisfying. I also really dug the rice and beans. Adding a Dos Equis to the mix, it was golden. I would happily return for another meal!"}
{"text":"This place is a really small and cozy Mexican restaurant. Although, it may look like a take out place, you can definitely dine in as well. The place was fairly busy as we sat down to have dinner. There was only one server so it took some time to order and be served.   We ordered the fish tacos and the chorizo enchiladas suiza. We also ordered a drink, a horchata, which was a rice pudding drink with cinnamon. It tasted like a churro but in a drink form! I really liked this and it looked really fancy in the large glass they used to serve it in.   I thought the fish tacos were a bit dry with little toppings but it came with 3 sides (beans, salad and rice). The chorizo enchiladas was yummy, there was a nice kick of spice and lots of flavor! It also came with the 3 sides.   It was a very filling meal and I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I would definitely recommend it - it's a nice gem in Scarborough if you are looking to satisfy your cravings for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while so my friends and I decided to go for old times sake. The restaurant is a cozy place that has a very homey vibe to it. The service staff is quick, attentive, and very friendly.   The menu has a large number of suggestions, but I went with the beef chimichunga. My friends ordered other items of the menu that I wish I could remember.   Food comes out at an average pace, expected of a smaller venue. Nachos and salsa are provided as snacks and come out warm and toasty.   The food comes in generous portions and packs a good flavour. The noteworthy thing is that everything tastes fresh - nothing is too oily or stale. I'm very impressed by this place and will definitely stop by again in the future when I'm craving Mexican food. My friends and I were very satisfied with our food and the portions.   I gave it 4 stars because I prefer my Mexican food a little spicier - I'll make sure to ask for a touch more heat next time and update my review then!"}
{"text":"I tell everyone about this place. The food is authentic, fresh and the prices are reasonable. Try the gucamole!! The service is great and i love the colourful decor, it makes you feel like you are in Mexico!!"}
{"text":"Margaritas are fantastic! Calamari was good, the bread it comes with is good as well. We had the fajitas and chimichanga. They were both filling and delicious!"}
{"text":"Extremely happy with this place! It was first time for me at Mexican restaurant, and I definitely come back! Food was very tasty! Their Corona taste better than anywhere else! Wonderful place, amazing service! Recommend his restaurant to my friends!"}
{"text":"Had the chimichanga and chicken enchiladas.  The food was good.  The wait time was a little long but the server was very friendly"}
{"text":"Completely disappointed. Stuffed peppers laying in a bowl of grease. Margarita's tasted like it was from a mix.  Salsa? Bland and like tomato soup, and only once choice.  Usually in better Mexican restaurants they'll offer 2 or 3.  And overpriced."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this food. My favourite Mexican place to eat in the city and its too bad I don't live close anymore. It really has Mexican vibes, the owners are from Guadalajara and the chimichangas are out of this world. My only complaint (and it's a big one) is how incredibly slow the service can be. We were regulars at one point and despite how loyal we were, it would sometimes take 10-15 minutes for them to come to the table to take drink orders. They need more manpower."}
{"text":"I've been on the search to find really good Mexican food and I found it here. The food is delicious and the prices very reasonable. Everything from the nachos to the refried beans to the entrees are amazing. I ordered the tabasco which includes an enchilada and burrito. Very fresh good quality ingredients. Go in hungry because the portions are huge. Make sure to try the refried ice cream. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"M√©xico Lindo is my favorite restaurant, with the sole exception of a pizzeria in Niagara Falls. This place is honestly amazing and I love every meal that I have had here and come back as frequently as I can.   The staff is hardworking and talented, but also vibrant and extremely interesting! The owners are actually Latin American and know what they are doing when it comes to Mexican food. The chefs are going non-stop pretty much all day, but the quality of their food is always high and the taste is consistently amazing.   I love to dine in because of the decor! It is distinctly Mexican and is filled to the brim with Mexican knick-knacks and art, as well as a huge portrait of the Don Equis guy, which is awesome.   The food is so good. I personally like the Chimichanga but everything is good. I have tried the tacos, fajitas, quesadillas, and burritos and have loved all of them. They come in fish, beef, chorizo, and chicken variants. I have never tried the fish, but all three of the other options are good.   The take out is usually not as good as the dine in food.   The portions are very generous and you get what you pay for! All meals come with rice, salad, and refried beans which are delicious and filling.   I cannot recommend this place highly enough. I simply love it, and return every chance I get. I have celebrated my birthday here for the past three years. If you are curious about Mexico Lindo, just go! It's awesome!"}
{"text":"Food was okay expect they were very stingy with the tortillas. We had fajitas for two and they gave us 4 tortillas and made us pay for more."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Definitely recommend this place to people looking for authentic Mexican food. Yummy burritos!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, but had to mark it down a little for slower service. Don't go if you're in a big rush. That being said, the food is consistently great and the staff are super friendly. I've been back several times, often to introduce it to new friends. Rumour has it that this one is owned by the same folks who own the one on Bayview, which I also love.  My go-to dish is the Burrito Grande because it's large enough for 2 meals (for me, a smaller appetite) and is delicious. Don't miss out on a healthy dose of killer guac and chips to start."}
{"text":"After trying to eat here a few times and finding it closed (lunch, and Mondays), we finally got to check it out for my birthday dinner. I'm so glad we'd persisted - it was delicious!   We ordered the guacamole and corn chips to start - fresh homemade guac was so delicious, and is now a must-have every time we go.   I ordered the burrito grande and loved it. Steak, burrito, sauce, refried beans, and all sorts of other goodness up in my belly. It's hands-down the dish I recommend when I take others here. Prepare to have leftovers if you have anything but a big appetite.   Service was great - we showed up a little late for our reservation with no hassle from them all.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We came here for Father's Day dinner on a slow Sunday. On google, it said the restaurant was closed on Sunday but apparently not ( they are open until 9pm), however when we called for a reservation they said they don't take reservation on Friday, Saturday and Sunday and that they were open till 8 pm.   Restaurant was almost empty and after eating the food here we understand why. Service was okay, food was so-so! Nothing extraordinary that I can talk about nor I would return for."}
{"text":"My standard fare at Mexico Lindo is the chicken flautas. The place is very kitschy but in a very fun way. The walls are adorned with sombreros and brightly coloured clay figurines. Can you say, 'Ariba '?! ( I can, after eating my satisfying meal of flautas).  After the server sits your party down, some nachos with two types of dips (one hot and one tomato) are set on the table to be devoured. The service is pretty efficient.  Now let me get to the beloved flautas. As the two crunchy rolls of chicken goodness wrapped in fried tortillas are placed before me, I always take a second to appreciate the presentation. The flautas are topped with lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream and it is served with rice and beans. My one criticism would be the small serving of Mexican rice (I think it should come with more and not just one rinky dinky bowl...I can handle the carbs).    Mexico Lindo is great, if you are craving Mexican food but you're too far from downtown and you are in Durham region. My only wish is if they also had tamales (one day, maybe they will have an epiphany)."}
{"text":"I really love authentic Mexican food, so my hopes for this restaurant were high. Was I ever disappointed, the only thing on my plate that had any flavour was the Diablo sauce. Which was a pleasant surprise because I can take a lot of heat. Everything else was bland and flavourless.  The beans tasted like they came right from the can and the rice was very plain. The chicken tacos I ordered tasted like they have been reheated in a microwave, after living without one for almost 10 years I can taste the difference. The \"salsa\" that was served with chips before my meal came was just some crushed tomatoes, which made me really sad because I love fresh pico de gallo!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican places in Ajax.  When you go in you feel like you are in Mexico especially when they have Mexican hats that you can wear and eat with.  The people there are super sweet and friendly.  They are asking us if we are enjoying the food and experience plus they're always smiling which makes the experience better.  The food is good.  Loved the guacamole there and had the veggie enchiladas.  Gonna come back here for sure."}
{"text":"I've had Mexico Lindo bookmarked for quite some time now, and I have to say that I'm really satisfied with my first visit at this family run business.  To put it simply, if you're looking for fresh and authentic Mexican food in Scarborough, than I would highly suggest trying this place out.  I ordered the Mexican Combo which kinda gives you a sample of things like chicken enchilada, beef chimichanga, rice and beans.  You also get complementary nachos and salsa which was a nice touch before the main food.  Afterwards, I ordered their churros which was really good! You only get 3 of them with caramel, chocolate and a raspberry sauce on the side.   It is a very small place so i wouldn't recommend coming in a big group. It's probably best for take out or for 2/3 people. I'll definitely be coming back again in the near future to try some of their other food out!"}
{"text":"Tradition mexican fare. Ive been to Mexico and eaten in local family homes. This is what you get at this resturant, solid traditional fare. Large portions at a decent price. In house made hot sauce was excellent. Mixed platters were more then filling and well prepared. Tequila selection was ridiculously disappointing as they only had a  'gold' tequila on hand? Seriously, thats just not right. Traditionalists would never drink a gold tequila, and too have one type of tequila on hand?( bring your own bottle stashed in your purse, because the foods worth it)"}
{"text":"Tiny restaurant with only 2 dining tables. It's more a take out place. Staff is friendly. I had the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde $10. It was delicious with chock full of chicken. My friend order the chicken taco salad $8 which came with lots of big chunks of chicken too. He really enjoyed his salad as well."}
{"text":"We came here Saturday for another awesome meal only to find a big FOR LEASE sign in the window :( This place was great and cheap.  Sorry to see it closed."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Mexican restaurant in TO.  The food is authentic and seriously delicious.  The restaurant is kitschy, service can be slow but the food makes it is so worth it.  Their mole is one of the best I have had and the drinks are large and tasty."}
{"text":"Went again and had Chicken Tostadas.  The tortilla never broke.  They never got soggy.  They were a real treat."}
{"text":"The decor is nice and the atmosphere feels right, but this place lacked a bit of service attention.   We dropped by for a quick bite as we love Mexican food. We ended up ordering the fajitas for two. It was a large portion of meat (we got chicken and chorizo mix) but there were only 5 (five) tiny tortillas... that didn't make sense to me. 2 or us, lots of meat, but very few tortillas...we asked and we had to pay to get more, which I thought was not reasonable. I didn't get more cause I'm cheap. Also, we got a tiny container of sour cream.   Overall it felt like they offered very little in terms of condiments.  I waited a good 5-10 minutes to get more napkins and some hot sauce (Something good and spicy) but no luck. I ended up getting up and walking to the front to ask for it. Overall the service wasn't great.  The fajitas were good but nothing out of this world. The selection of Mexican beers was also limited.  We will have to keep looking for the ultimate Mexican Food place!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal! Complimentary chips and salsa were tasty, salsa had good heat. Vegetable enchilada was seasoned well. Fish tacos (one of the specials tonight) were tasty with a dollop of guacamole on top, green salsa and fresh cilantro. I threw in some of the salsa from the chips and it was delicious! We got the deep fried ice cream for dessert but was disappointed to find out it wasn't actually deep fried; it appears to be just a big scoop of ice cream covered in corn flakes in a tortilla-like bowl with chocolate sauce and strawberries. It was tasty as it was but \"deep fried ice cream\" is a misnomer; ice cream sundae is more accurate."}
{"text":"It's a small store with a few seats but the food was very authentic and home made like. The portion was large and good mix. They have good desert as well."}
{"text":"I waited until I made two visits to review.     prices reasonable, food excellent,service frustrating insulting ,challenging,disappointing.     Fresh house made to order Guacamole ( I believe)  7.00/order . The first time the amount of guacamole served small, second time it was twice the amount. First visit we both ordered tacos, I had ordered hard shell and my guest ordered soft shell, my hard shell tacos where just as soft as his soft shell tacos. I did not say anything because due the service that I will address it was truly not worth the hassle. The tacos are served TWO per order with rice&salad I can certainly live with out . That is about my personal likes and dislikes and I am not fond of a pile bland rice and iceberg salad.However both dinner companions were satisfied with it. We both preferred three tacos so we both ordered TWO Taco dinners . I was very unimpressed that we were served each TWO plates . Being in the business to me that is a no brainier. Why would a server do that? It is just inconvenient to have two full dinners on 2 plates in front of you and comes off as lazy. Why not serve all 4 tacos on one plate? Having pointed that out again I will say the server said he was going to serve it that way but there was no point in struggling to ask for both orders of two orders be combined on ONE plate. I was already exhausted from the near bickering with the waiter it took to place an order.The tacos are very good. The guacamole fresh and very good , chips fresh and good,salsa was okay I have had better. That was the first visit.     SECOND visit ,We had Sangria , maybe the BEST I have ever had. Guacamole again, I had a beef burrito,my guest had a steak with shrimp again both dinners served with the traditional rice and El Cheapo Iceberg lettuce salad. This time I requested no rice and all salad that was just to boring to bothered with . My guest  tried to request a color for her steak and the ALL knowing waiter cut her off abruptly speaking over her and informed \" Steak only comes one way \"  They call it medium , I call it WELL DONE, grey throughout . If you want  steak cooked less I wish you all the luck in the world going through that battle. My burrito excellent and NO rice inside which I appreciate.     Service. I had the same male waiter both times, yes, there was a language barrier but this is a multicultural city and language barriers happen,I am okay with being patient and working through it . What I am NOT okay with is having every request met with a challenge , a near argument, repeating my request 8 times and to the point I am ready to walk out of the restaurant . I am NOT OKAY with being met with a passive aggressive condescending laugh at every turn or being made to feel unwelcome before my ass hits the seat. FIRST experience after placing the order I asked for a side of hot sauce , the hottest they have please . The waiters response was \" I will make the guacamole spicy ? the salsa that comes with it is spicy\" My response \" No Thank you , leave the guacamole as it comes, I would like a side of actual hot sauce\" the waiter gave me the SAME response with the addition of that rude laugh. I again give him the same response with the addition of \" I just want hot sauce on the side as I like to add it to things how I want, thank you \" AS I wondered why I was now explaining any of this LIKE  IT MATTERS if I choose to add it to my food or put it in my eye :)  After 4 rounds of that my guest said \" All she wants is hot sauce on the side can she not have that ? \" The waiter finally agreed to bring me hot sauce. My guest had requested guacamole on his tacos and for whatever reason that is NOT possible, I guess he thinks we are real dummies (there was a challenge ordering our drinks on both visits) we both had two orders of tacos that were served on two separate plates so both of us had to eat with two plates of food in front of us. I attempted to request it was 2 orders on one plate for each of us and I was answered with \" All pork taco's?\"  Visit #2 I asked to sit inside and I was immediately challenged on that by the SAME WAITER.I had to explain I am allergic to bee's and want to sit inside. He challenged our drink order. Here is what really almost had me leave the place. AGAIN this hot sauce challenge , exact same response to make the guacamole spicy. He then brought me salsa with a little hot sauce added.I asked another waiter for hot sauce and she brought me proper hot sauce.Eventually our waiter saw this and asked if I did not like the hot sauce he brought me.I said \"No,that is salsa you added a little hot sauce too. There is not enough space permitted to give all the exhausting details but I do hope this gives you the picture. The waiter should not be creating such a challenge or be arguing period with guests. I maybe a white girl , please do NOT tell me what level of heat I can tolerate, please kindly bring me some hot sauce,  Not impressed at all!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, and it's always packed at dinner time."}
{"text":"Looks like a dive from the outside, but the food inside is amazing.  Have eaten here several times and always left thinking I must go back.  My wife loves the pollo con mole, and I'm a big fan of the enchiladas. I like the Tabasco combo which is a beef burrito and chicken enchilada served with a spicy red sauce on the burrito and a milder green sauce for the chicken. Of course they have bottled hot sauce for those like me that like their dishes spicier.  The staff are very friendly and so the service is great. Don't be put off by the outside appearance, this is great food."}
{"text":"I am not experienced at all with Mexican food so I don't know whether the food is really authentic but I do know I found the food to be delicioso. The refried beans were much better than I expected and the nachoes had a perfect blend of a lot of ingredients on good-quality tortilla chips. Also tried the horchata for the first time and found it quite refreshing. Prices are reasonable with the portion served. It's not the best value ever but you also don't feel ripped off. The owner was very enthusiastic to serve me which is always a plus.  I know I would be back when I'm craving for some more Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? I felt like I was in Mexico again. I love this place and you will too. The food was really good! This in not a fancy place or a place to bring your first date but if you are looking for real Mexican food...this is your place.   PS if its your birthday you get a free fried ice cream. Its the size of a softball and its full of chocolate , cinnamon, caramel and so much more."}
{"text":"My wife had cravings for a Mexican food last night and we ended up at this joint for dinner.  I usually don't leave reviews nor love Mexican food, but this place was really something else.  The big burrito I had with shrimp, all the ingredients were fresh, perfectly cooked, it just tasted really good.  Especially the tortilla was toasted so well.  Highly recommended to everyone. I'll be bringing all my friends over to this join for legit Mexican food night."}
{"text":"Cozy Mexican restaurant in a local plaza. Fish tacos were delicious and reasonably priced, included rice,  salad,  refried beans. Had to ask for guacamole on the side (wasn't offered as an option). A slice of lime would have been nice too.   Owner was very friendly and offered warm tortilla chips and salsa while waiting for the meal.   Would go back to try some other items next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food is amazing. The service is so friendly. Love that it's family run as well.  The inside is super cute too"}
{"text":"With the demise of two of my favorite west side Mexican food spots, The Spousal Unit and I have been forced out of our comfort zone and out to the far reaches of East Washington in search of decent stuff. As mentioned before, Mexico Lindo is off in the middle of a parking lot and doesn't look like much but....  I had business with a bike shop out on East Washington so I convinced S.U. to join me and have lunch while waiting for my bike. We were the only ones there for an early lunch but were soon joined by a few other customers, most likely native Spanish speakers from south of the border.   Fresh hot chips came out served with a kick-ass green salsa and a very nice red one. I wanted to order a mix of tacos but was told the three taco plate had to all be the same since they cooked everything fresh (good sign) so I settled on al pastor. S.U. ordered chicken gorditas (3) that sure looked like sopes to me. Both lunch plates came with rice and beans. Add a pair of Negra Modelos and I'll call it Lunch! An excellent lunch! Their dinner menu is the same as their lunch menu but with larger portions. I would come back to try their mole, since everything that we had was so good and fresh.  It's a long way across town, we'll make it back at least one more time but if I lived on the East side, I would get to know the ladies who run this place."}
