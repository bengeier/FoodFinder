{"text":"Update: This place is closed. It is now Caribbean Nights. After reading the rave reviews, we were hoping to try the food."}
{"text":"Never heard of a Chinese and German place so a few of my friends and I decided to try it out. The food was really amazing, and so was the service. It is very inexpensive, and there are lots of things to choose from. The restaurant decoration was also very nice."}
{"text":"I've tried the ribs with vegetables and fries as it was recommended by others and it was really good.  Food portion was big compared to the price as well.

My friend ordered deep fried chicken wings and I would definitely go back to get that next time I visit.  It was one of the best chicken wings I had.

Definitely a place to try out, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the portions were big. I recommend the sausage dish with French fries. The chicken wings were very good as well. 

The service was great and our waitress was friendly.The chef does not use a lot of oil when cooking and it shows. Personally I prefer this. 

Was an all around great dining experience and I would go again."}
{"text":"I ordered chow mein, it was good.  My boyfriend ordered mushroom fried rice, it was a little too salty. He also ordered a pint of dark beer, which was very good (according to him - as I don't really drink). The restaurant seems like it's family owned and run. Very friendly. Would definitely come back sometime when we're craving for Chinese, since I live in the area."}
{"text":"I recommend the german pork hock. It is smoked and it tastes amazing. i also recommend the beers, they have a couple of german beers on tap. pretty good service!"}
{"text":"The food here is excilent very fresh and.  Tasty order what you like the way you like."}
