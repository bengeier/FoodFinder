{"text":"The original. I'm confident these sandwiches can go up against any traditional Italian veal, chicken and meatball sandwiches in the world. Growing up a mangiacake in Little Italy over 30 years ago (when there weren't that many of us) I had no idea how special it was. It was just the place in the 'hood to get your veals. Me and my younger brother used to spend our allowance money on veal sandwiches, walking a couple blocks past Sicilian Ice cream, or other sweets vendors, as we valued the sandwiches more highly. Now, having seen more of the world and sampled its fare, I have a deep appreciation for the simplicity and quality of the sandwiches there. I don't know exactly why they taste better than any other Italian sandwiches but there is apparently some serious alchemy going on in the back with the fat ladies banging pots and hollering in Italian.  Those sandwiches are certainly for my money tastier and more satisfying than any gourmet panini with soft cheese and unpronounceable mushroom.   This locale retains a fair amount of its authenticity despite a half-hearted superfluous reno years ago. Nobody goes here for decor, service or ambiance, although the unapologetic lack of these is part of its charm. They come for sandwiches, and my mouth is filling up with saliva just thinking about it. No use describing it, just get one.   As a family man now living further west I don't get here often, and while the franchised facsimiles don't compare with the authenticity, I have to admit they seem to have a bit of it and the sandwiches are good. But the original is the original."}
{"text":"This place knows how to pick your pocket. Sure, the sandwiches taste good (particularly the veal), but you can get something similar for a better price elsewhere.  The problem is that they charge you close to 8 bucks for a meat and sauce sandwich, with no other toppings or sides. You end up paying a buck more for every other little item you add. On top of this, if you don't come with cash, you have to pay extra to use their ATM, since they have no debit or credit.   In other words a drink and a sandwich, with a couple toppings (no sides) will end up costing you around $15 after tax, if you use the ATM.   If you're feeding more than one person, that adds up to a fortune for lunch."}
{"text":"I hated this place at first.   I thought the sandwiches were weird and soo messy and a bit expensive, but now I find I get a craving for one every week or two.  It's a crazy big sandwich, covered in homemade tomato sauce, and its a mess, so be prepared.   I have only ever had the chicken before with cheese and onions and its so nice.  It's a little pricey, but you do get a good portion of meat and as I said, I get cravings now for one.  One thing I've heard is that they're cash only, which is a bit of a pain, but in my experience, they take cards here."}
{"text":"If your hungry and want a lot of food this place is good.  Quality is questionable to me, stay away from the veal service is mehh."}
{"text":"Want a 1,000 calorie sandwich? Go to California Sandwiches cause you won't find a better one!  Husband and I treat ourselves to a veal parm sandwich every once in awhile and it hits the spot every time. They are massive sandwiches, often requiring 2 sittings to finish it but I always do. We top ours with provolone cheese and hot peppers. I would also recommend getting sauce on the side, they can get quite sloppy otherwise and I love a sandwich I can dip.   I have tried the steak and the chicken sandwiches also but the veal really is where it's at. Man I might need one soon...*drool*"}
{"text":"The young blonde woman who served me at the cash register the past couple of times really needs to learn a thing or two about customer service. I'm not quite sure who this 'princess' thinks she is, but I've never encountered such a phony. Her insincere smile is about as genuine as her hair colour with the expression on her face fading back to indifference as soon as customers backs are turned. It's quite apparent that this individual feels as though she's above everyone she serves. As a minimum wage employee working at a Mississauga  sandwich shop, of course she is. What was I thinking? The fries are terrible too. Would give zero stars if at all possible."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches. Took my big bro and sis-in-law there to thank them after a hard day helping us move. Blinded by exhaustion, I'm sure I didn't get the full experience but what I remember was good! The Chicken Parmesan sandwich I ordered was so large I had not one but two meals out of it, thus impressing my thrifty side AND my taste buds.  Judging by the non-moving-related sweat on the brows of my boyfriend and bro, the extra spicy veal was plenty hot enough for them. BUT I'm afraid California Sandwiches gets a big slap upside the head for not accepting any form of payment except cash!! What is this 1952? And prominently displaying one of those sketchy looking \"ATM\" machines really brings down the tone. I refuse to use them at all costs, having your debit card compromised 3 times makes one a tad skittish. If you're going to charge me almost 45 bucks for 4 sandwiches I think a wider variety of payment options should be available."}
{"text":"I would like to firstly start off saying it is my first time on this app. From reading the reviews about California sandwiches on chesswood I'm pretty shocked to read some of the reviews. There seems to be some confusion as to what this location offers as they apparently have more than one location.   As a customer going to California on chess wood for the past 15 years I must say they never fail to meet my high standards. This location unlike some of the other ones, does not offer pasta, pizza, French fries or have a hot table or have the mini sandwiches. So I don't know, what some people are talking about when they say they're pasta is horrible. They only have the one size sandwiches and as for sides they have salad  , olives and dried sausage. It doesn't really matter to me that they don't offer as much sides,as I could careless since there sandwiches are so filling.   As for price people complain it's to over priced. Well think of it this way if you want good food, then you need to pay for it. I believe the pricing is fairly reasonable as you get what you pay for. I have yet to still be able to finish one whole sandwich!  Most importantly they finally take debt so, that's one great news!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  A friend had been telling me about this place for a while and our first attempt to try this place out was met with disappointment since California was closed. Therefore, we went in a second time, a week later, with an excess of anticipation buildup. And California did not disappoint!  Highlights:  - Excellent chicken sandwiches! I recommend adding mushrooms and cheese. The sandwich comes with TWO breaded, deep fried slaps of chicken breast, your toppings of choice, and mild, medium or hot sauces, all served on a pretty huge, fresh, italian bun (but not huge enough to cover all of that chicken!)    - Generous portion sizes!   Tips:  - Do exactly as the ladies (aka sandwich nazis) at the cash tell you if you want your sandwich!   - Forget about the veal. Not the best in my opinion. Order the chicken instead.  Bottom line, I highly recommend California. And the only reason they get 3.5 stars instead of 4 is because they are a bit too expensive (after adding a couple of toppings the sandwich will cost you at least $10.) and the fact that they are running their show like sandwich nazis.

{"text":"I dream about the amazing eggplant sandwiches at the 244 Claremont Street location of California sandwiches. I was delighted to discover a Northerly location of my dream lunch spot. Unfortunately the delight did not last.   At Claremont a single sandwich makes for two satisfying meals. At this location, not even one.  Let's have a little comparison, shall we?  244 Claremont Street                            2474 Dufferin St.  a giant stack of eggplant                       a single layer, comprised of two pieces     stacked high,                                         side by side, does not fill the bun  sweet or hot sauce well seasoned        the sauce is red. No other discernible qualities  cheese is included                                 if you want cheese, you pay  2 satisfying meals in 1 sandwich           satisfaction is to be found elsewhere.  Sure, the Dufferin St. location is larger, more modern, and has three fountains inside, but would you rather eat at the place they put all the love and effort into the cooking, or where they care about the appearance of the dining room.  Never again. One, one single layer of eggplant. Never have I had an eggplant sandwich with so little eggplant in it."}
{"text":"Eat here.  I'm vegetarian, so I get the eggplant sandwich and it is a happy, happy affair. A single sandwich is two satisfying meals and they never disappoint. The counter staff is friendly, and once, after ordering, when I discovered that I did not have quite enough cash for two sandwiches and olives. She said not to worry and tossed in a 1/2 a pot of olives at no charge.  I love the old feel of it, it's like eating in the fifties, where the food is made by someone who has personal pride in the product.  Tip, there is no shame in tucking a few napkins into your shirt before you eat - in fact, it's a good call."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Massive sandwiches - bigger than the other California Sandwiches locations.   This place hasn't changed in decades. The Place is falling apart and hasn't been painted in years! You can see the \"chefs\" in the back room frying the veal etc and everything is cooked fresh to order. Had veal and chicken and both were excellent. Crispy crumb which is soaked in tomato sauce and (if you like it spicy) hot peppers.   There is space to eat in a side room, with a couple of old pinball tables and there is even some parking on the south side of Trefod."}
{"text":"When the Dynamic Dudes moved to England, and I moved to Gore Vale in Queen West, it was told to me, in fact, demanded, that I go to California Sandwiches because of how close I lived to the Claremont location.   Purely because of that demand, I ignored it.  Not going once until they returned home a year and a half later.  It was a mistake I will never live down.  Yes, it can take a while to get your food, and sure its pretty sloppy when you are eating it - but the cleanliness of a meal is the last thing I would concern myself with - particularly when it tastes this good.    You could easily eat a full sandwich on an empty stomach - but saving the other half for later is always a nice treat.  I have to say that the spice is done right, the sauce is fantastic and I have yet to have a sandwich taste better or worse than the last time, which speaks to the consistency of their meal.   I love that and its what keeps me going back.  When you do something right, it should always be the same."}
{"text":"I go here all the time. Best sandwich in town. Perfectly breaded fried veal with mouthwatering tomato sauces that gets absorbed in the whole sandwich. You gotta get it with onions & provolone. I prefer extra sauce on mine that's just me. Get a brio soft drink on the side. When you bite into the tender veal with the combination of the sauce and fresh bread and sweated onions, it's amazing. All for around $10, great price for such great food."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the Gandhi of Italian Sandwiches. Irresistably delicious food while using second-ish grade meat. I get the impression that eating California Sandwiches more than once a week will probably kill you within 10 years, and you'd deserve it.  But it's so damn good. Huge sandwiches (if you're not a fat guy, lunch is half a sandwich) jammed full of deep-fried ethically-questionable but undeniably delicious sliced baby cattle, topped with provolone and Italian tomato sauce, all inside a perfectly unobtrusive Italian kaiser roll. I personally like mixing it up by getting veal and eggplant and adding peppers, onions and mushrooms. At least I'm eating a little bit less baby cattle than the other fat guy in front of me. The upgrades cost you though, which usually makes the outing just that little bit more expensive than I really think lunch should be. If it's dinner, I feel like I'm ripping them off.  As with Gandhi, expect to wait for your food. Aside from the fact that Italians don't do anything fast, from what I can tell it's almost always being prepared by an Italian grandmother and her protégé granddaughters, so calm down. It's worth it. Grab a pot of (half decent) olives and snack while you wait."}
{"text":"I went there expecting the same bad experience as my first visit, but this time the service was more pleasant than before.  Even though the service has improved, the sandwiches did not. Nothing but low quality food. Biting into the sandwich, I could immediately tell the meat was sub-par. If you are foodie like me, then you should not expose your tastebuds to this etrocity of a place. (Etrocity is a bit of an exageration)  Would I go there, probably not unless there are no other choices."}
{"text":"Sloppy sandwiches because bread is store bought.  Bread  was too soft all around very processed thus every bite was messy because meat and sauce too heavy for the type of bread the use. This is  NOT real  fresh off the oven soft on the inside but crisp on outside bread which is what Italian bread should taste like. Sauce is canned yuck I would rather drive to more authentic Italian taste out in the west end to a place like Comisso Brothers"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever been to this chain and I was not disappointed. For being downtown Toronto, it wasn't unreasonably priced, especially for how big the portions are. I got the chicken sandwich with cheese (medium). Medium was way too spicy for me. So I suggest that if you can't handle spice, get the sweet one.   Cons: The selection wasn't huge and the base topping is just tomato sauce. For every additional topping (such as cheese) is extra charge. So the only time you're ever gonna pay the price that's advertised (beside the chicken sandwich at least) is if you only get it with the sauce that comes on it.   Pro: the portions are huge, couldn't finish my onion rings (which are amazing by the way). Inviting atmosphere and also very fast service. Defiantly will be going there when I'm in that part of town again."}
{"text":"Here you'll find a kaiser bun veal sangwich drenched in tomato sauce that will put you to sleep after consumption. Excellent food, but can exceed $10 for lunch."}
{"text":"I live on the opposite side of town and I still make the trek to get the sandwiches here.  There's always a line, and it's always packed, but it's so worth the wait. You can call ahead to place your order too! The sandwiches are amazing every single time; mind you I get a chicken with sweet sauce and cheese every time, so I can't comment on all their sandwiches.   Also, you may not want to come here if cops bother you. I've never been here when I haven't seen cops. But everyone knows cops only eat at the best places--right?"}
{"text":"This place is a scam if you don't eat meat!!! I ask for a veggie sandwich No cheese No onions No breaded eggplants  Just the mushrooms and rapini and zucchini! I am taking away 2 of the more expensive ??? ons and asking for veg and you are going to charge me $2 more your expect me to pay $12+ for a sandwich with 3 veggies and no cheese THAT IS THEFT I will never get a sandwich from Cali sandwiches EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and tasty sandwiches.  The cutlets are commonly fried fresh to order since demand exceeds supply.  Tip: if you don't like messy hands, ask for less sauce.  Lines can get a bit crazy during lunch hour so try to go a bit before or after. If you must go during the lunch rush, then call ahead and place your order for pick up.  Chicken sandwich, less sauce, sweet peppers, mushrooms and cheese. 5*"}
{"text":"So I have to say this is my very favourite place to eat. Their Italian sandwiches are the best in all of Toronto.  The chicken and the eggplant are my fav's but I'm always tempted by the steak and the veal - all are amazingly fresh, hot and delicious. You can order the sandwiches anyway you like - no sauce, extra sauce - hot, sweet or mild. I think their sauce is the best. The staff are super efficient - usually very busy around dinner time but will always have your sandwich within half an hour.    There is a choice of eating in or takeout.  While waiting there are a couple of pinball machines to keep you entertained.  No fancy ambiance simply good old fashioned homemade sandwiches.  I especially like that there are no gimmicks or bad advertising to lure people in - the business has operated successfully on word of mouth.  I've been eating these sandwiches for 40 years and the quality has remained consistently excellent.    Parking is good. Location is central - Toronto's original Little Italy.  Establishment is really clean."}
{"text":"This location is not up to par with other locations. I got a chicken, cheese, med spicy. Chicken was tough, there was no spice and a small amount of sauce. Please sort out this location please!!! Brutal!!!"}
{"text":"The BEST veal sandwich in the city. I can never finish the entire sandwich in one sitting so it's TWO meals for me. Very organized and wait times are short even when they're really busy. I've always gotten \"to go\" since the eating area is usually full of take-out patrons waiting on their order."}
{"text":"California Sandwiches knows how to make a real classic Italian veal sangwich! The chicken cutlet and eggplant versions are also excellent. Lots of competition by some of the neighbouring restos but none come even close either in quality or value. Service is a little brusque but efficient. Pre-order so you don't have to wait so long in line."}
{"text":"Best veal sandwich I've had in Toronto. It's Italian style and you choose the toppings for an extra cost. Absolutely massive, you will be struggling to finish it. Can get busy at lunch, but the line moves fast."}
{"text":"Love Italian sandwiches and I been to a few places but so far I am impressed with California Sandwiches and the prices are basically the same everywhere."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! I always want to come here. The veal sammach with provolone yum! And so inexpensive for such a filling sammach. Keep up the good work. !!"}
{"text":"They are busy here during lunch and dinner rush so except them to be a bit overwhelmed and possibly not provide the best service but the sandwiches are excellent. I've been going here for years."}
{"text":"This place is always fantastic. They have a great steam table during the week for lunch. We go every Tuesday for their Asian themed hot table and Thursday for their fish. My girlfriend loves their salads and pasta fagioli soup."}
{"text":"This place is a winner.  Obsessed with the veal sandwiches, you get alot of veal and it's just soooo sooo good.  Love the little tiramisu cups they sell.  I usually write long reviews but there's nothing more I can say about this place, other than its AWESOME!!! If you are craving veal or chicken on a big fluffy bun, come here!!"}
{"text":"As far as Veal Sandwiches go .. I would have to say this is the place. Huge Sandwiches! I like mine with hot peppers and provolone. The sauce is great and the staff is quick. What more do you want from your veal sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Original location is still the best by far. Plentiful amount of veal with just the right amount of tomato sauce and hot pepper. Doing it right since the 50's"}
{"text":"Lots of long reviews here so I'll be brief...  Best veal in Toronto"}
{"text":"Not as good as the others. I know it has only been opened for 2 weeks but I have given it 2 tries because I love California Sandwiches. The veal was not crispy and only half as much veal as the other 2 locations that I frequent (Claremont and the Queensway).  What a disappointment. Hoping they get better but they only have 1 more try before they strike out totally."}
{"text":"Love Cali Sandwiches!  My fav is the chicken sandwich \"medium\", so topped with a few stewed mildly hot peppers. OMG delicious.  I get sad on Sundays because they're closed."}
{"text":"Do not go!! Save your $10 worst veal I've ever had and I'm Italian. Veal was like a rubber band, one bite and the whole thing slid out of the breading that didn't obviously adhere to the veal. Obviously poor quality meat. A veal place in the Woodbridge area should be ashamed of themselves! Disgusting!!"}
{"text":"I dropped by for a quick lunch on New Year's Eve, and two girls behind the counter were some of the worst customer service I ever had! If it wasn't for their sandwiches, I would never return."}
{"text":"I've been told this is the original location and you can tell... the sandwiches are amazing! Veal is my favourite, chicken is really good as well. The portion size is huge, I'm glad they started offering the mini sandwiches which is good if you aren't hungry. Pro tip... call ahead to order as it can get busy!"}
{"text":"Completely confused as to why this place gets great reviews.  Counter service  = barely personable.    Buns = tasteless  Meatball Sandwich = mystery meat with no flavour whatsoever  Bathrooms = disgusting!  Need a complete scrub down and overhaul.  Hate to think that the people who prepared my food used the bathroom.  Not happy with value for $$ by a long shot."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The sandwiches are the best i've ever tasted, particularly the steak and chicken ones."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, but they just dump the sauce on. I've been here a few times and each time, the sandwich is covered in sauce and the bread will eventually break.  Its still good food, you just have to eat it too fast to enjoy it properly."}
{"text":"My review for this place is just the noise Homer Simpson makes when he thinks about food.   Seriously If you haven't been here you haven't lived."}
{"text":"They only do one thing, honking great big sandwiches, but by God, they do them very well. The enormous soft kaiser roll is heaped with breaded veal or chicken, roasted peppers, and then literally drenched with homemade Italian tomato sauce (at least it sure tastes like nonna's!). The result is enough to fill even the largest appetite, and certainly make an absolute god-awful mess of whatever shirt you happen to be wearing (so word to the wise - do NOT attempt one of these babies in your best white dress shirt and tie!  You've been warned!!). The service is friendly if a little terse, probably because they are constantly swamped - all the more amazing as the location in the middle of a residential neighbourhood is about as drab and unassuming as it gets.  I keep going back for the sandwiches though...!  Messy and delicious!"}
{"text":"A single sandwich costs $13. They have a nice sitting area which is never busy. Sides and drinks are extra. They do not have combos. Probably will never go there again."}
{"text":"What could I say about California Sandwiches. The only thing that comes to mind is for the past 36 years I've been sinking my teeth into there sandwiches. If I live another 50 years or so I will continue to sink my teeth into there great sandwich, there out of this world. On the down side I've seen some chances in the past years. The sandwiches have become smaller in size and the prizes have gone up way up! The thing that gets me is the F@#king line-ups to place an order, regardless if u phone,camp over, buy the house next door u are going to wait. Once u enjoy a great Veal sandwich at California's, u will become hocked and screwed for life. Look at what it has done to me, I'm a Vegetarian for F@#k sakes, my eating of veal has gone against my believes and now I'll eat any live creators on my plate. Vegetarian's please stay away u will be sorry!"}
{"text":"Just came back from this place and to be honest, I was very disappointed.. Heard a lot of comments so I tried the famous veal' sandwich..  First thing you notice, the sandwich is huge and very heavy!  Then you need to figure out how you'll eat it! Yes, there was a lot of meet and sauce so not very easy.. Let's talk about the taste now. The breaded veal and the tomato sauce were just tasteless. Even though it might be a homemade sauce I didn't feel any spices at all.. No salty, nothing.. Hopefully I added some extra onions..  Well, I'm also very picky about food but this sandwich had nothing special, really..  Good points though, I liked the location and the restaurant itself and the girls who work there are nice and smiling. The olives I had were nice and of course the sandwich is massive!  My conclusion, if you're not really picky and just want to eat that much, go ahead! For less than $10, you'll be full!  Also, I might go back because I always try twice hoping that it will be better! But after that sandwich, I'll probably try another one.."}
{"text":"What can you even say about California sandwiches? It feels like a giant glob of foods you shouldn't be eating, but you don't really want to stop. The sandwich itself is a thin pounded piece of meat that is then breaded, fried, and drenched in tomato sauce. You can add lots of veggie toppings and goey cheese (extra cost) and its all topped with a soft hamburger bun that really can't contain its holdings. Veal's popular and probably the best. They also have small desserts on the side that I've never tried but look good.  The cashiers are either pretty young girls or an old man which is a gross combination you don't want to think about too long. Definitely get your sandwich to go, this doesn't feel like a place you want to stay in for too long.   I really considered giving this place a lower score because you can get better sandwiches elsewhere with a less skeevy vibe, but those places are all much further away. This place is basically the holy grail for 15-25 year old dudes who consider the gym their life or love food too much to care, love to boast about their european or middle eastern background, and like driving around with their squad catcalling women."}
{"text":"One of the only sandwiches I will risk the 1000 calorie count for in Toronto. The Veal sandwich is so good you don't even need to try anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Ordered through uber eats. I usually go to the original location but my home is near the Yonge St one. The sandwich arrived hot but the veal was chewy and was not as flavourful as the original. I'd stick to Claremont or queensway."}
{"text":"The sandwiches with the works are awesome, my only complaints is the long lineup everytime I go there. Wish the services would speed up a bit so customers wouldn't have to wait too long."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Only downside is they only take cash and ask you to withdraw from the ATM.  However well worth it for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Delicious Sandwiches! My go to place for a chicken sandwich. They do take a while to prepare so don't go if you're starving. The portion size is LARGE. I usually eat half and save the rest for lunch the next day. I've tried the chicken and meatball sandwiches. Both great. The only downfall is that they are very messy to eat. I feel like they just slop on the sauce quickly, stick on the bun and serve it covered in sauce.  Sandwiches are quite pricey for what they are. It's a piece of breaded chicken.  the toppings are pricey too. Cheese I believe is almost 1$. I have a weakness for mushrooms, so that's another $1. My sandwiches come out to around $ 8. Sometimes  the breading does come off of the chicken.  Overall, I am a returning customer."}
{"text":"the Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!    They say the best way to have success is to do one thing, and do it well. California Sandwiches makes veal and chicken sandwiches ($9) to perfection. I know they have many other options, but I can't understand why anyone goes for them. Have the veal, and get whatever toppings you think your stomach can handle. This place has a cafeteria feel, and there may be a lineup in the parking lot as well as near the counter; however, you won't care about ambience as you scarf down the delicious generous tender slice of meat on a sumptuous bun with hot sauce. Go hungry, as a regular California Sandwich can feed two normal people quite well. This is not a romantic getaway; this is an awesome sandwich shop.  4 stars"}
{"text":"THE BEST veal sandwiches hands down. No question. Have many shops closer to work but the travel is worth it. Would have them more often just can't get away from workplace."}
{"text":"By far the best veal sandwich in town. I was introduced to California Sandwich by my Italian co-worker (Louie) as a hangover recommendation. At the time I was living at College and Bathurst so my first experience was the shop on Claremont (will review under that location).   He was right about the hangover cure but he was also right about the quality and flavour.   Depending on your taste buds you really have 3 offerings. Sweet, Medium, or Hot veal. I recommend cheese on all and you best get it cut in half. A side of black olives and a Brio Chinatto complete the experience.   Make sure you grab a boat load of napkins. You're gonna need 'em.   The Queensway location is easy to get to an has it's own parking. It's a more modern facility than the original (like the Yorkdale location) with bright open dining room and a fast food table area feel.   Your bang for the buck is excellent and you'll leave feeling sated and maybe even a little tired.   Hankering for a veal Sammy - this should be your destination."}
{"text":"Meatball sandwich is crack.  In general, I am inclined to small meals, with well prepared, high quality ingredients. I'll own it, I'm a bobo, foodie snob, mainly in the internal dialogue in my head, but nonetheless inclined to disdain mammoth, Americanized food of any stripe.  I didn't even eat ground beef before this.  Am now a devoted, soon to be mammoth, California Sandwich devotee. The veal is marvellous as well, and the eggplant well executed (nicely seasoned and surprisingly tending towards crisp).  Also love the sense that I've time travelled to nineteen seventies New Jersey that comes with the semi-shabby, semi-industrial look of that area of Claremont, and the very Italian famiglia vibe of the staff.   Make haste; kill your hunger here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Anyone who's has the audacity to complain has been stuck in a McDonalds world. There's nothing better then fresh, great food. And it's been around for like 16 years at this location and the rest of them have been family operated for like 45 years. No mater who you are you have to admit that's an impressive track record. I wish I could have one of their sandwiches everyday."}
{"text":"It's California Sandwiches...same stuff as every other location, which means decent but not great sandwiches and relatively high prices.  I don't suggest takeout since your sandwich will be pretty soggy by the time you eat it.  Fries were really good,  cheese and tomato salad was very unremarkable - go to loblaws for that instead.    For the best sandwiches and great value hit up Mustachios at St Lawrence Market, although I guess this fills a need in the area as there is nothing really comparable, except maybe I Went to Philly which is a heavier meal."}
{"text":"Pretty good bargain for the amount you get. I had a veal sandwich and asked for \"hot\" but it wasn't that spicy - enough to notice it has peppers but not enough to overpower everything. The breading gets soggy but the fun isn't in having a crispy sandwich rather a savoury meal. Their shop is clean and you can trust their franchise to make sure it's consistent between locations. Pretty decent, if definitely come back for the large portions and the food in a pinch!"}
{"text":"They just can't do it right. The Chesswood location is 10x better from the bun, to the meat, to the toppings, the sauce... they aren't much friendlier, but you get the point."}
{"text":"Best veal sandwich in the city! The veal is perfectly cooked, the sauce is wonderful and they put just enough on, and the bread is fresh."}
{"text":"This is the original location and the best by far (I've been to them all). If you're in Toronto and craving a mega veal sandwich, then there is no better place in the continent as far as I'm concerned. The sandwiches are MASSIVE and always fresh. Pair it together with a Brio and prepare for shear enjoyment, it just doesn't get any better! If you get there at lunch hour be prepared to wait a while because it can get extremely busy. Seasoned veterans such as myself have their number programmed into their cell phone and call a half hour ahead to avoid the line-ups. Vets also request that the sandwich NOT be cut in half (it ruins the structural integrity). Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Been going here for 20 years and the sandwiches are still amazing!  Would definitely recommend for either steak or veal sandwiches."}
{"text":"My favorite cutlet sandwich in Toronto. I typically order the chicken cutlet sandwich with mushrooms and cheese, and spicy. The quality of the chicken is excellent. I used to eat these sandwiches more often, but been trying to healthier these days. The sandwiches can often make 2 meals as they are big.   The Dufferin location is good because it's open on Sundays and they have a buffet that is really good deal if you want to feed a family or a group of people on the cheap.   They take cash only, so bring $20 and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just finished having dinner here - I ordered the veal with cheese and hot peppers. Sandwich was....well....meh. You get what you pay for - veal was cooked decently, there was just nothing crazy special about it. Ladies were actually friendly and nice.   For me, I would eat here again if it was convenient but wouldn't go out of my way to find this or another California sandwiches. Especially considering that there are cheaper places to eat nearby."}
{"text":"the portions are big yes. But the veal was bland  and overbreaded. the sandwich with nothing on it came to $10.  the sauce was okay at best. classic example of quantity over quality"}
{"text":"The sandwich was made in a timely Manor... Was juicy and delicious... The Eggplant was well done and it was bug enough for me to share if I wanted to.... Would come back again"}
{"text":"OMG!! My Best friend introduced me to this GEM. Apparently this is the oldest location which has been in business for over 40 yrs. While I was waiting for my Veal Sandwich (recommended) I was casually talking to some of the local customers there also and they had been coming for 40 yrs. the sandwich was HUGE and sloppy-ily delicious. Not sure why they are called California when they are Italian :P I can't wait to try another. Tip: ask for extra Onions!"}
{"text":"This was definitely the worst California sandwich I've had. I've eaten them for years at a variety of locations and this one was terrible! It tasted off and it was cold, which was weird as I waited 5+ minutes for them to give it to me, perhaps they threw it in the freezer to cool it down during the wait time?   Either way, if you're craving a good sandwich head south, Richmond hill just doesn't have the goods"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Bought one with a credit card earlier in the week. Went back again and the cashier tried to tell me they don't accept it, just debit. I get it, you don't like the cut the credit card company takes off the top. Just don't piss in my ear and tell me it's rain."}
{"text":"Wow what bad service!! The girl at the counter very rude to me as well as the poor lady in front of me..when I asked her if I can get one sandwich a bit spicy she pointed her finger to the back over her right shoulder while looking right passed me. Took me while but I realized she was pointing to the menus!! Hahahaha felt like I was disturbing her by spending $20+ of my money on two sandwiches!! So sorry that I came to this place..service counts a ton"}
{"text":"The king of Italian sangwiches.  Just around the corner from San Francisco Sangwiches and Bitondo's pizza this place has got the biggest italian sangwich in Toronto.  The place is tucked into a residential area and it's the only retail in two blocks of homes and a school.  We ordered 15 minutes ahead but I think they only made it when I got there.  Good thing I beat the line.  Bonus I saw them make them.  Huge pieces of veal, generous portion of onions and shrooms. Topped off by a ladle of tomato sauce - I thought they were prepping a pasta dish.  For three sammiches (oops sangwiches) I was warned to hold on to the bottom of the paper bag or risk having them rip it open.  Based on weight alone, I think we had 3 pounds of food.  At work, the big reveal.  OMG it was sloppy, moist and the juicest sangwich I've ever had.  Thick and tasty breaded veal.  Medium peppers where right, complementing the sauce and breading.  Schrooms and onions lightly sauted.  Bread soft and tasty.  Luckily I cleared my desk and I was wearing a dark sweater.  If I was wearing a white shirt, I'd be a bit distracted having to take down this wonderfully sloppy this sangwich.  Damn good."}
{"text":"The veals are absolutely amazing!!! Every time I go there I am never disappointed. The sandwiches are definitely a meal and you will be left full after. The wait can be long during the lunch hours but you can always order on the phone to save yourself the time. It's a great place for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"\"Sauted\" onions shouldn't be crunchy. Also, any Italian sandwich place worth their salt has   the heat in their sauce - not globbing on jalapenos that was not mention to me because I would have definitely said no).  To their defense, they did offer to make me another sandwich. I said no because I had more pressing matters like taking an unexpected trip to the pharmacy to get some Benadryl since my lip was starting to swell. Next time I will just take 10$, rip it up and throw it in the wind."}
{"text":"I have eaten at California Sandwiches for some 30 years and to be honest it has gone downhill in quality for quite some time.  Mind you the prices have shot up considerably because of the franchise of the name.  As an Italian sandwich it is decent but no where near the best I have had.  As for value for the dollar... forget it.  Ridiculous!! 10 bucks for a bun and very thin chicken breaded and fried ... add any toppings and it is beyond stupid in price.  The pictures make the sandwich look huge but that is just the bun.  In all honesty, you can buy a whole cooked chicken from any super market and  you got at least a couple meals.  Cut the chicken breast and put it in some sauce for 10 mins and you got a great Italian sandwich for less than 3 bucks.    Service is adequate,  but just a few months ago my friends strong armed me into coming to this California Sandwich location  (it is my least favourite for quality)  and at 8:30 they ran out of buns so they gave us micro buns ... They charge like big time players but run the place like the stooges.   If you have never eaten Italian sandwiches before then you will likely like this place and not know the difference but with a tiny bit of effort you can get way better sandwiches elsewhere without all the massive expense.   WAY WAY overpriced and over rated.. but based on the line  ups at some of these restaurants I am certainly in the minority."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I have eaten here since they invented dirt.  The original establishment had the old Nonnas in the back cooking and during any economic summit the place was packed with cops, RCMP SO it was the safest place in Toronto.  That was then... now it is pretty expensive for what you are getting... sadly all the locations vary greatly in quality... They were the go to place to eat late at night.  HOWEVER, I recently got back into town just before 9 PM on this past Saturday night.. called California on Chesswood to order a pickup sandwich.  SORRY WE ARE CLOSED 1 MINUTE AGO.  Summer hours ... which is news to me on a Saturday night.  Sadly they are victims of their own success.   As such, although the sandwiches are decent and not spectacular by any means, I won't be buying anything more from them ever again.  Way too many other choices for much less money.."}
{"text":"Amazing veal sandwiches! They are absolutely huge sandwiches. They are always busy and the time it takes to make the sandwich is a bit long, but we'll worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time to this location on Saturday and boy was it bad.  I have been to other Cali Sandwiches and they have never disappointed me before.  Whether I order the chicken sandwich or the steak sandwich, they were all good.  But this location put a halt to that streak.  I ordered the chicken sandwich, sweet.  It looked like just any other chicken sandwich I would get at other location; that is until I took a big bite.  The bread they used were harder than usual and the chicken were super dry.  And what in the world did they put in those sweet sauce?  Never did I have trouble fnishing a chicken sandwich but there's always a first and it was right here at this location =/  My only compliments would be that there's plenty of seats and parking lot is sufficient.  Cheers."}
{"text":"This place is a staple in my take out roster. I would pick their veal sandwich as my last meal, if I had to. Always delicious!"}
{"text":"So I've had steak, veal and eggplant I love the veal the best.  in my opinion this place is the best for a fantastic tasting messy sandwich."}
{"text":"This is the worst customer service I've ever seen in the food industry . Someone needs to teach the employees how to treat the customers who are paying their wages .long time customer and won't be back"}
{"text":"Consistently good food. They never disappoint.  If you're coming in for lunch try ordering ahead of time, especially if you're on break.  I've been coming here for years and their massive sandwiches always come out piping hot.   What more is there to say?  I tried the Mississauga location and they are nothing alike."}
{"text":"They've moved.  Dufferin and Castlefield now.  The parking lot SUCKS.  My sister had a car accident just getting into the parking lot.  You've been warned.  I get the hot eggplant sandwiches, although my co-workers get the hot veal. We used to get the hot table all the time when they were at 2700 Dufferin, but the prices just kept going up and up and up.  So now just sandwiches.  Tip 1) Call ahead and place your sandwich order, this way you skip the huge line up!   Tip 2) If you do get the hot table, wait to get one of the younger girls to serve you-the owners wife has a light hand.  Also-ask for a bun, it comes with the hot table, but if you don't ask for it you don't get!"}
{"text":"First off, I'd like to say that I use the word delicious very sparingly. People who know me know that when I use this word, I'm serious. Let me also tell you that when I use the word delicious, I am speaking specifically about the taste and texture of the food. Delicious does not consider the ambiance of the restaurant, the level of service from the staff or the prices. To me, delicious means something tastes so good, that I just want to keep eating more until I have trouble breathing (yes, I have done this before). It means that I like something so much that I would like to have an endless amount of room in my stomach so that I could keep eating until my jaw is tired (I haven't figured out how to do this one yet).  The veal sandwich at California Sandwiches is delicious!  California Sandwiches is a special place. It is not a fancy place by any stretch, nor is it a hole in the wall. It is just right. I love going in to this place and seeing the Italian women work their magic in the open kitchen. The women that work here are warm and have just the right amount of 'tude, so you shouldn't F with them. California Sandwiches makes me wish I was Italian. So much so, that I always make sure to get an espresso while I'm waiting for my food and a Brio to drink with my sandwich.  My sandwich of choice is the veal sandwich with cheese. I have tried the chicken and steak sandwiches in the past, but don't give these rivals my delicious stamp of approval. You might be asking yourself, \"what is in this sandwich that makes it so special?\" The answer: LOVE. Here are the steps in making a veal sandwich at California Sandwiches. Step 1: Take a huge crusty bun that is not too crusty, with a soft and fluffy interior, put a layer of some incredible tomato sauce on it and toss in a little bit of love. Step 2: Lovingly cut a huge piece or two of breaded and fried veal so that it fits the sandwich just right in kind of an overflowing but perfect way and then toss in a little bit more love. Step 3: Another layer of sauce and more love. Step 4: Slice of cheese that will become melty, another layer of sauce and even more love. Step 5: Wrap it up and deliver the hefty sandwich to a lucky customer.  At the end of the day, I believe that this sandwich is perfection. The ratio of meat to cheese to sauce to bun is perfect. The texture of the slightly crusty exterior and soft interior of the bun, along with the 2-3 layers of thin, but crispy veal, the melted cheese, and the sauce comes together to create a sandwich that is layered to perfection.  I would also like to say that the sandwiches are not 100% consistent from location to location. This happens to be one of my favourite locations along with the Claremont location. I have also been to the Woodbridge location and the Dufferin location, but I don't think they have quite mastered the \"Love\" as well as the Chesswood and Claremont locations."}
{"text":"I live around the area and visited this place several times before writing this review so I can write a fair assessment. Unfortunately, the first thing about their sandwiches is that it - wasn't great as what other people make it out to be. The sandwiches are bland and just poorly put together. Secondly, the customer service of the people behind the counter needs significant improvement. Sometimes they are bad mannered and I've seen them (mainly the ladies) just roll their eyes way too often in front of other customers when the customer is simply placing orders or asking clarification. If I were the owners I would really talk to the staff and convey two things about the your business - good food is complemented by equally good customer service which leads to more customers."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever.  End of story full stop!  Huge deep friend breaded chicken breasts, smothered in cheese and tomato sauce and a fresh kaiser."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever.  End of story full stop!  Huge deep fried breaded chicken breasts, smothered in cheese and tomato sauce on a fresh kaiser."}
{"text":"I personally will never eat at this place ever again. I ate a meatball sandwhich and I couldn't eat more than 6 bites without gulping down something to drink to wash down the taste. In the end I was debating whether to ask for a refund because it was like $14.00 or something like that and I ended up throwing away more than half.   I don't consider myself a very picky eater and I'll usually eat almost anything... but this was flat out disgusting. When I came home and told my mum that I ate there she said \"Ohhh you didn't get the meatball sandwhich did you\"... Maybe similar taste buds got transferred genetically there... Either way thats 2 reviews in a nutshell.   Maybe I'm coming across a little harsh since I really only tried the one meal there... my girlfriend had the veil and she said she liked hers. Nevertheless, I will never eat there again and if you decide to, Don't get the meatball sandwhich."}
{"text":"Great food. Ordered the veal cutlet sandwich and it was decent. You have to pay for any toppings however which is a bit of a rip off seeing as how I am already paying almost $9 for a sandwich. The guy at the front taking orders was pretty ignorant. I gave him my visa to pay with and was then told \"what's that? We don't take that crap\".  Uhh OK well I can pay with debit if you just say so nicely. Everyone has their bad days but I would prefer mine not ruined because of it."}
{"text":"This location and the original one Claremont serve the greatest sandwiches,, veal, chicken, meatball, steak, eggplant and soups. Stop and eat here. Pro Tip if picking up a sandwich at lunch or dinner call in and place your order and jump the queue."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here have always been great.  I go to two other locations regularly as well and the food is always good. Best Italian sandwiches. You can't go wrong with the veal or sausage w/ onions, mushrooms, sweet peppers, zucchini, and cheese. Makes for a gigantic sandwich but it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"Veal is good but not cheap especially if you order extra toppings. Recently renovated looks much better. They fry each veal separately in a pan so be prepared to wait -especially when it's busy."}
{"text":"Sign says open now Sunday 12pm-8pm. Arrived at 5 pm and was denied entry. Guess they close whenever. What is the point of business hours if you do not honor them? Won't waste time coming back."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are great, but they need to do something about the ordering process....had ordered already, and was sitting down eating our food, when I got up to ask for another beer, only to realize there were at least 20 people in line ahead of me to order food...after waiting in line for 5 minutes while my wife and kids were sitting and eating, I eventually gave up, and just went back to my seat without another drink. They really need to change their ordering process"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST of all the California Sandwich locations. Taste-wise, it's up there with the original location downtown but this one has a wider range on their menu whereas the downtown one is mostly about the sandwiches.   I've been going to this location since waaaaay before they opened in their current spot and I've never been let down. The only time I've been dissatisfied is when the peppers are too hot but that was a poor judgment call on my own part. Know that their version of HOT really is H-H-H-H-O-T!  Their sandwiches aren't as cheap as they used to be (they're now about $9 without all the fixins--onions, peppers, cheese, mushrooms are all extra) and a lot of Italians I know scoff at California Sandwiches, but I can't say I've had better veal or chicken cutlet sandwiches elsewhere, and believe me, I've had many in this lifetime! They also have mini sandwiches for about $5 which is about the size of a \"normal\" person's idea of a typical sandwich--it's enough for me with a drink, but I tend to overdo it when it comes to food!  What I also love is their hot table, which I was always torn to try because it meant having to forgo the sandwich, but I finally did and it's a good deal. You can get one item for $8, two for $11, or 3/$13 and can select pastas for all three options for $13 if you want. In other words, you don't have to get a salad and a side with a \"main\" if you don't want to. I usually go for their eggplant parm which is crispy on the edges, cooked perfectly, and topped with cheese. The creamy lasagna is OK with mushrooms and chunks of chicken. Penne a la vodka is decent, with chunks of sausage, their salad is alright as well. I tend not to get things like potatoes or other sides if I have the option to pig out on heartier stuff. I love rapini though, so sometimes I get that.   They've got tiramisu made in-house that is also yummy but I've had it on occasion when it's not that fresh. They used to give monster pieces but then they got smaller. Same thing with the lasagnes, the pieces can sometimes be ~30% bigger or smaller but still it's filling enough even when it's on the small-ish side. The other thing that isn't cool is that there are no price lists for the drinks and no receipts are issued unless you ask (I don't want to waste paper just for the sake of curiosity; and if I'm hungry, I don't want to waste time) and sometimes I have no idea how they reach the totals that I end up paying. I'm sure it's fine but I don't like that.  Beware that mealtimes (especially lunch time), and weekends get pretty crazy so that there's a guy who has to referee the parking lot! At least you know that you're getting fresh food due to the high turnover. And the sandwiches are pretty huge, often with two layers of breaded cutlets wedged in a bun. I don't usually get all the extras as it gets too messy, but also I like the taste of the cutlets on their own and don't feel the need for all the frills."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Tasty and filling veal sandwiches, although I cant say it was very fresh. For what it is, it's probably a tad overpriced to come here too regularly but I'd definitely comes back."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place to grab a quick sandwich! More of a fast casual place. There are tables to sit at inside, and there were also a few tables outside to sit at when the weather is nice.  Came here on a Friday night around 8PM with my family and it was pretty empty.  Service: There weren't any other people in the restaurant when we went, but still they were friendly and accommodating. Waited for our food at one of the tables inside and it was ready in about 10 minutes.  Food: We got two regular-sized steak and onion sandwiches (about $9 each), and my aunt got a mini-sized sausage and onions sandwich (about $6). The steak sandwich tasted pretty good flavour-wise. As other reviews have mentioned, the onions are only lightly cooked and not caramelized, but I still liked it. Also, I felt the meat was a little on the tougher side, but that's to be expected. The sausage and onions had a bit of spice and was better in my opinion. MAJOR KEY: They really smother the sandwich in sauce, so I would recommend asking for sauce on the side for any sandwiches! I think you also end up getting more sauce as well that way so it's win-win!  Value: I think it's great value, especially considering the regular-sized sandwich might be able to feed 2 people depending on your level of hunger. If you're not as hungry consider going for the mini-sized sandwich, which is cheaper but still quite filling."}
{"text":"Decent veal (still too expensive and soggy). Props (people still say that, right?) to the amount of hot peppers on it, though.  Brutal meatball one. 80% breadcrumb or something. Such a weird wet consistency."}
{"text":"This spot is not as good as the original one on College. If heard as much from friends but assumed they were just delusional.. after having both within a couple weeks I can confirm.  Also... this place is getting expensive which doesn't suit the blue collar style. For a veal parm with the works you're probably looking at $15 for just the sangwich"}
{"text":"I remember years ago, when my parents were doing some renovations on their home, my older brother (he's an idiot) slid his chubby body in between 2 studs and started bouncing back and forth while yelling \"I'M VEAL! I'M VEAL!\". Like I said, he's an idiot. But whenever I go to California Sandwiches and order the veal I always think of that. Luckily, my appetite comes back as soon as I unfold the foil and reveal the delicious mess in front of me...my destiny.   The negative points about this sandwich are undeniable. The veal isn't a very good cut, it's a long wait, the sandwich itself seems to be unnecessarily messy and the topping (such as peppers, mushrooms, cheese, eggplant, onions) are all extra making this an expensive sandwich, but in the end...it's worth it.   There's no getting around the fact that this is just a really tasty sandwich. It's certainly sufficient, even for a healthy (see: gluttonous) eater like myself. In fact a sandwich and a pop is usually all I need. I normally get the mild veal with cheese, mushrooms and onions. If I'm really feeling like ballin' strong I'll order some olives.   As for the other items on the menu...don't be a pussy, just get the veal. My friend \"Chicken Parm\" Phil used to only get the chicken (obviously) but after finally taking the plunge he claims he'll never go back. I guess he's getting his chicken parms at East Side's now.  Oh and if you're struggling with the ethical issue of eating veal, don't worry, I'm SURE it's not actual veal. Also, while typing this review I clubbed 3 baby seals to death. I wonder what I'll do with them...probably nothing."}

C'est connu de tous les chauffeurs de taxis de la ville, les policiers en pause repas, les travailleurs des chantiers avoisinants : sanwichs à l'italienne, parfaitement délicieux et avec une atmosphère qui n'est pas sans rappeler les quartiers italiens de New York ou de Chicago !   Les propriétaires ont ouvert de nombreuses autres California Sandwiches à travers la région, sans jamais réussir à égaler celui-ci, le premier, l'original !"}
{"text":"To me its the best veal sandwich in town. Thats the ,only thing I eat, can't comment on the rest of the menu.  Little Italy location is better but the queensway is good."}
{"text":"The veal sandwiches here are just amazing. I get it with cheese mushrooms and onions.   A few occasions the customer service was poor but when I eat that sandwich all is forgotten!"}
{"text":"I went to California Sandwiches last night based on my friend's recommendation. I had the veal sandwich with onions. Honestly, this place has renewed my faith in a proper veal sandwich.   Will I come back again? You damn right I will be back very shortly. Phenomenal sandwich at a more than fair price what more can you ask for. Thank you."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak with onions.  Amazing at other locations but missed the mark here.  Meat was less than other locations.  Sandwich was very dry with so little sauce I could barely swallow a mouthful.  I didn't finish it because of that reason and I've never not finished a California sandwich. Too bad."}
{"text":"Not quite up to par.  California Sandwiches has a very nice dining environment with nice decor and a spacious and clean setup. Unfortunately, the food isn't quite up to par with the aesthetics.   I ordered the veal sandwich and if I had to describe it in one word, it would be 'sloppy.' The veal's breading was soggy and seemed to be slipping off the meat. Don't get me wrong, the taste of the sandwich was 'OK,' but considering the fact that the food is a little bit pricey, you would expect it to be better tasting and better made, not just OK or soggy."}
{"text":"Rub a dub dub, three men in a tub stuffed to the gills with Cali sandwiches.  What can I say?  I've been going to this place since my high school days.  That makes it almost 30 years.  You can't go wrong with this place.  When I first started it going, it was grandma in the kitchen, daughter making the sandwiches and the granddaughters at the cashier.  Sauce is home made; the kaiser rolls are always fresh; the meat is always freshly cooked.  The sandwiches are huge and it is the equivalent of two meals.  I can have one for lunch and still be stuffed at dinner time.  Since I have moved south of the border, every time I am back in Toronto, I head here to the Claremont shop for my fix.  I order the veal with cheese and hot peppers.  Very tasty and just fills that hunger spot.  Also, when I head back to the US, I will come in and order 6 sandwiches to take with me.  I freeze them and pack them in my bag.  Heating up the frozen sandwiches the next day is a treat.  The buns have soaked up the sauce and the peppers get hotter.  It just reminds me to get my next fix when I am in town.  This place is a hole in the wall.  There is limited parking and it can be a zoo during the week day lunch.   I recall one time they had an order from the Toronto Stock Exchange for 300+ sandwiches they filled as they served the people coming in.  They've taken it down now but they use to have letters of praise from various organizations and sports celebrities on the wall.  It was so cool to read those letters.  I hope they will put them back up.    I have tried the franchises that have opened up and they are not as good as the Claremont store.  If you want a HUGE sandwich, go to the original."}
{"text":"Been going to California Sandwiches since I was a kid, this place may have gotten to big for its bridges.  They served me a sandwich with raw chicken, yes they exchanged it right away for the veal but the damage was done, got a huge stomach ache an hour after, you can't mess around with raw chicken."}
{"text":"What crappy service the young girl was like a zombie . Not sure why They cant make the same sandwiches like Toronto. They are cheap on the  meat. Mama should take a drive to all the location and slap them for not doing it right. Thank God I drive often enough to the city to get a good sandwich.  California Sandwiches Claremont St. Toronto is the best of the best"}
{"text":"No body. Beats this place"}
{"text":"This is the ORIGINAL California Sandwiches location and still one of the BEST of the many locations in the GTA. The food is always excellent. I regularly rotate my \"Sangaweej\" orders between the veal and steak sandwiches and they're both absolutely FANTASTIC!!!   If I am downtown, I do my best to try to go here on a regular basis. The only drawback is that parking is really Tight!  This is the location that sets the standard for all other Italian Sangaweej restaurants in the GTA."}
{"text":"Aside from the original location downtown, this location on the Queensway is just as good as the original restaurant IMO.  The veal and steak 'sangaweejes' are the best in the GTA - hands down (at the original and at the Queensway location). Nobody else comes close: The amount of meat they pile on is the best, and, you can even order one of the sandwiches with Double Meat, YES, DOUBLE MEAT, (will cost more $$$) and it is amazing!  As well, as an extra bonus, you can order the meat on a plate, with no bun, or bun on the side and you can enjoy your low-carb sandwich guilt free!  The lineups at lunch or dinner time can be very long, so plan ahead.  Lots of parking at this location as well!  Make sure you come hungry, because you will be hard-pressed to finish your sandwich!  Buon Appetito!!!"}
{"text":"California here I come!!!  This IS the 5 star Italian sammy joint in TO.  There is a reason that people drive and/or bus in from all over the GTA to get their fix.  The reason is that they manage to consistently deliver a splendidly executed simple meal in an affordable and portable format.  Veal is the gold standard, but the chicken and eggplant options are equally worthy.  Wait - Can you hear it?  The din rumbling up from the  uninitiated / unbelievers \"How hard can it be to make a good Italian sandwich?\"   Judging by the legion of soggy, so-so, sorry-ass sandwiches that make up most of the rest of the offerings in this metropolis, prett-y, prett-y difficult.  Seriously, if you haven't tried one - you owe it to your taste buds to score a legendary meal for under $10 that is accessible by bus.    Ironically, it will most likely require these gorgeous movable feasts to be featured on a US-based sitcom to be given their cultural due.  I'm going to go ahead and nominate 30 Rock as the current logical choice.  There's got to be someone on Yelp with sufficient pull to get Liz Lemon to trek to TO in search of sandwich nirvana....Yes, this will inevitably cause Cali Sandwiches to go Hollywood - but it will be ensure that it lasts for rest of my natural life.  I can endure a bit of a line for that!  Ignore the whining and hurt feelings from the \"have it my way\" crowd and head there - for lunch - now."}
{"text":"It was my first time at California sandwiches. Their menu selection is decent. They have chicken, veal, pork, and vegetarian options. The decor of this place is bright and modern ! Not a bad place to be in for a quick bite.    We ordered the chicken & veal sandwich. Each additional topping costs extra money. So we only added onions on top. And each sandwich comes with tomato sauce. They make each sandwich fresh, so there is a 5 min wait time.   The sandwiches are massive ! They are so nice and juicy, something you wouldn't expect in a sandwich. They are so delicious ! Both the chicken & veal sandwiches were very good, however, if I had to choose one, it'd be the veal. Will be returning for more yummy sandwiches"}
{"text":"Oh my god, I ordered a steak sandwich through UberEats today and almost died because it was so good. Everything about it was perfect, from the soft, warm bun to the thick generous slices of steak, all the way to the grilled eggplant that they added in at my request.   Omg omg omg, it was sooo good. Cannot wait to try out more of their menu!!!"}
{"text":"Their food is really good ! Sometimes they get super packed but the girls in the front keep it very friendly, organized and professional .  Love their chicken ! And their bun !  This location is highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is a hugely welcome addition to an area that I've always considered pretty tough in terms of good food options. I'm not too concerned with the question of how this location compares to the others - what I do know is I had delicious veal and olives. I'll be returning."}
{"text":"We had the chicken and the veal. Like the original California Sandwiches location (College and Bathurst) , .the sandwiches are huge and filled with meat and sauce. Even though the sandwich looks the same, it doesn't taste the same as the original location.  Highly recommend going to the College street location for the authentic sandwich."}
{"text":"I fell in love with my veal sandwich. A fresh bun stacked with fresh fried veal cutlets, hot peppers, sauteed melted cheese and topped/smothered is sweet tomato sauce. This huge sandwich is enough to satisfy your hunger.  Also tried the rice balls and they looked delicious but I was really let down. They were cold, and the cheese wasn't even melted in the middle. Lacking flavour and that special Italian comfort food touch.  Prices are reasonable!  The sandwiches are where it's at! Don't wait, get your veal sandwich and ask for extra sauce on the side just in case you need some more."}
{"text":"A Toronto favorite NO MORE! My last visit was beyond disappointing. Soggy and stale bread is not something you'd expect from a place like this especially when they move so many sandwiches daily. On top of that it was made super sloppy and dry. The Dufferin location is even worse. If I ever go back, it will only be the Woodbridge location."}
{"text":"My office ordered lunch from here for a group meeting. It was a \"meh\" for me and not just because I'm not crazy about Italian food. Firstly, there were no sandwiches. Apparently the catering/delivery menu doesn't offer sandwiches and only offers salads, pastas, veal and chicken, etc.   We had veal and chicken parmigiano, pasta pomodoro, lasagna, and green salad. The salad was fine. We all thought the veal and chicken were too salty. The veal was tough. And the pastas were nothing to write home about.   Honestly, I just don't get the appeal with Italian restaurants. I can make pasta so much better at home that isn't just overly salty tomato sauce and way too much cheese. I don't understand why people pay for pasta. That's the easiest thing to make at home and it's dirt cheap. Restaurants love when you order pasta because their margins are huge on those dishes. Order a dish you can't make at home or that cost the restaurant more to make. Rant over.   TLDR: It was meh Italian food."}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the best veal sandwiches you could ever have. The only one better is from the \"mother\" location of California Sandwich, which is located downtown.  All you need to know is four simple words, \"HOT VEAL WITH CHESSE!!\"  A must have.  And well your at it, make sure that your order a side of olives."}
{"text":"We love this place!  We make a special trip to Toronto just for these sandwiches."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are amazing. Cool trendy little spot for a fast meal! Veal sandwich is a must. Be warned they are filling! Ask for extra spicy if you like to walk on the wild side"}
{"text":"Today was the opening day of California Sandwiches at Yonge and College!  I placed a take-away order for a mini version of their popular Veal sandwich for $4.49 - not including toppings.    Crunchy breaded veal smothered in tomato sauce on a fresh mini Kaiser bun. A mini version of Italian sandwich heaven!  They have salads too. :p  The space is new and bright and there is seating available.  I imagine lunch will be crazy busy.   Service was friendly and they were pushing out orders quickly.  Yay. :)"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and good service. The girls serving were great and very helpful. The food is on par with the downtown location. Very clean eating area. Overall a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I used to love California Sandwiches - soft bread, melty cheese, lots of tomato sauce and crispy fried eggplant fillings. What's not to love?!   I found out today that their tomato sauce is cooked with a veal shank in it. So, no sauce for me. The standard sandwich came with eggplant, sauce and a sprinkle of parmesan. Cheese was an extra 1.25$.   So, I had a crispy eggplant sandwich with cheese and no sauce. It was fine, albeit boring and dry. Without the sauce, it was lacking in flavour and not worth it. I don't think that I will be back."}
{"text":"ORGASM IN A BUN. That is all.  Get the veal. If you're a fat ass and/or just very hungry, get the regular sized ones. The mini version is HUGE enough for me.  The only iffy part, the picture of the onion rings in the sign does not look like the end product. It was processed and gross, but awesome sandwich nonetheless.  Order it with mushrooms, hotpeppers and cheese. YUMMY! I go to school a block away and I am so happy it's just right there, but with a student budget, I can't blow $12 all the time just for lunch, YUMMY regardless!"}
{"text":"Yes.  Yes yes yes yes yes.  So messy.  So bad for you.  So delicious.    I've only tried the eggplant, but it's so good I don't mind getting anything else.  The sandwiches are so hot and big and delicious.  The sauce is great.  Everything is great.  I love it so much.  It is a little expensive, so I can't eat there all the time.  That's for the best, though, because I would if I could and I'd weigh 600 lbs."}
{"text":"**First let's say they have moved location to 2474 Dufferin south of where the were to the corner at Castefield.  **On to the review...parking is murder they have about 15 spots one way off of Castlefield.  Me being the crazy driver i am went in off of Dufferin and got a spot right by the entrance, unfortunately not realizing that I actually absconded it from a driver doing the right thing.  Must apologize if I get caught.... This is a very busy place for car people, not much walker inners.  **I ordered a Sweet Veal (sorry Veggies/Peta), and a Steak and Onion on Bun, and they now have this beautiful hot counter that has Pastas, Saute Veggies (Rapini w/tomatoes), Italian Style Potatoes, Assortment of Different Salads, Olives et al.  **I also got a 3 Cheese Rigatoni with Tomato cream sauce & Artichoke.  + One pop (asked for 3 coffees, only serve the fancy stuff) all was for take-out.  **Went to give Visa/Interac, no ONLY CASH,  but they do have an ATM on site $1.50 charge (which I had to use)  **They use the number system like the other locations, this one is printed on a fancy bill, instead of a sticky note.  #68 that was me.  **Order & Food (about 7 minutes), now the line at that time had about 40 people in it, only 4 when I got there on a Thursday just before Noon.  However the place was packed with tables dining, hence the full parking lot.    **Yes, did I mention they have seating, new cafeteria style overlooking lovely Dufferin Avenue (watch all the cars go by)...hey it's better then people peaking in and seeing you try to manoeuvre those huge messy sandwiches, no one is dignified when you eat these suckers.....plenty of serviettes need apply.  **OK OK How was the food.  I went to meet a few friends at a Painting Job,  We shared everything (had to stop and Tim Hortons to get coffee blah).......The sandwiches were hot, buns very fresh, Veal was tender and sweet peppers added, just enough sauce not over the top,  steak was also tender very good and just what you'd expect.      **The pasta was really good, I mean really good.  They must of just made it...Piping hot with cheese and veggies and creamy tomato sauce and the portion was huge (comes with bread). only $7.95  **This is there best location by far, I always went to Claremont but when I'm craving I'm gonna go here to the Dufferin one.  **2 sandwiches, Pasta, + Pop   $28  not bad for 4 people sharing.."}
{"text":"Hands down the best veal sandwich in Toronto. That's pretty much all you need to know. Meatballs aren't boo shabby either.  Pro tip - call ahead and avoid the wait. That said, it's totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Not sure of the negative reviews, but I think the sandwiches are decent on its own and this is a popular local joint in the area.   Really good solid Italian sandwiches that are HUGE to eat. For less than $8 a bun, you will definitely be stuffed. Veal sandwich seems to be the most popular choice as it is quite tasty, I got the meatball which is also very good as well.   Bread is soft and moist with a 80% meat and 20% bun ratio. The meat and sauce tastes homemade and good to eat when you want something else other than a burger. Not the cheapest thing for just meat-on-a-bun but you can add onions and jalapeno peppers for free. Beware - the jalapenos are spicy like death and required several cups of milk.   Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Had the veal sandwich, very delicious. Staff was very friendly. The portion was very large. Good value and great taste."}
{"text":"Chicken - Medium (peppers) - Mushrooms - Onions - Cheese ... Sauce on the side and an order of spicy olives. I've said that over 150 times since they opened (originally across in the Tim Horton's plaza before they built the new place). The quality of everything from the meat, bun and toppings is superb. 2 perfectly prepared pieces of chicken fried to perfection. Yes it is a pricey sandwich but it deserves to be."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with some friends from work.  Between the 3 of us we ordered two veals and a steak sandwich.  Ok veal, very bready, did I mention how much bread?!  Although I didn't try the steak it looked better.  There are much better veal sandwiches in the city.  If you visit this place bring Tums."}
{"text":"The place is great for giant burgers! I have been here multiple times for lunch. The place has some wicked size burgers.  I had their chicken burger and let me tell you I was not able to finish it! the way they get your pocket here is through the adding toppings which are around a $1 or so. The service is fast and the burgers are tasty.  For my fellow Muslims - I inquired about there halal status and they have a certificate only on their chicken burgers, other stuff is not halal."}
{"text":"Fantastic! The best option is their VEAL SANDWICH, by far! I've been a fan of Cali Sandwiches for years. As another franchise of their ever-popular, original, family-run sandwich shop on Claremont St. in Little Italy, this one also does not disappoint! It's modern, clean, spacious, and newly renovated.  Their veal sandwich at this location is comparable with the original shop - delicious tomato sauce; crispy, breaded veal; and a fresh bun. Very filling! Worth the price (under $10)! They fry their meat in olive oil! Although, a bit more expensive than the original store because of the Yonge St. area. Can add extra toppings like mushrooms, provolone cheese, onions, etc. for extra prices.  A pro is that their lines are much smaller and they're less busy. Wait time was only 5 minutes.  Will be coming back again and again! I always get my out-of-town friends to try their sandwiches as well. Craving one now..."}
{"text":"Eggplant is perfect. Marinara wonderful. The extras on the sandwich will dilute the wonderful eggplant taste...perhaps avoid any extra toppings. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I lived in Toronto for 19 years, but only discovered California Sandwiches recently. Oh how I've missed out all these years!   For those who don't know, California Sandwiches is known for their veal sandwich. I must admit, it's the real deal. It's a pretty damn good sandwich and it's the only thing I have ordered from California Sandwiches since.  The veal cutlet is perfectly fried, retaining its external crispy texture while locking in the moisture and juiciness of the veal. The kaiser bun is not fancy, but soft, freshly baked and compliments the breaded veal nicely   In my opinion, the marinara sauce makes the sandwich and brings all its individual components together. It's well-seasoned, slightly spicy, sweet and tangy. I order mine extra-spicy and find the heat pretty mild, so I wouldn't be too afraid to spice things up.    You can also order additional toppings for $1 extra. I like my sandwich with mushrooms and sweet peppers. Yum! I'm getting hungry just thinking about the sandwich. For those who are opposed to eating young cattle, I've heard that their chicken and eggplant sandwiches are just as good.  While Toronto may not be known for one single food item, the Italian Veal Sandwich from California Sandwiches certainly deserves a special mention."}
{"text":"Big but mediocre. A good veal parmesan sandwich should be crisp, absolutely covered in marinara, and the cheese should be free. My sandwich was none of these and to top it off the mushrooms I added on tasted canned (a Toronto tradition it seems after having Mr sub and street vendor hot dogs). I doubt I'll return to California Sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place has amazing Italian style sandwiches.  I'm mad that we don't have anything like this back in the States.  I always get the veal sandwich with rapini added and it's perfect every time.  Be warned that you will probably not finish this as it is massive.  Veal sandwich with rapini: 9/10"}
{"text":"You can not go wrong if you come here for a sandwich. The perfect monstrous amount of meat bread and that delicious red sauce. Nowhere does it better than the Claremont location.   I always eat the hot veal with onions and cheese.   Also pinball in the dining room."}
{"text":"Great food. Great portions. It's an affordable meal for lunch and dinner. Love all the topping choices."}
{"text":"This is the Place!!!! All though there are many different locations for this franchise, come to the Queensway location. I have visited 4 other locations and this location is still the best by far. Portion size good. Price is reasonable and always always order the olives on the side with an Orangina. California veals has a winner."}
{"text":"OG location. It suprised me when I arrived to this newly renovated joint. I haven't been here for a very long time. I usually have my friend to deliver the sandwiches to me.   I remember when they had creaky doors and when I entered there would be an army of nonnas making your sandwich. And now when I enter I see this chic looking joint and in the back the kitchen staff looked very young. I had lost confidence in the place.  Until I got my veal sandwich. It was delicious, it had the right amount of sauce. It wasn't too drenched or too little sauce. Perfect amount. I would say it tastes like 90% like before.    Veal cutlet was fried perfectly. The portion remained huge.   I can't go to any other location."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. By far the best Italian sandwiches in Toronto. If only you could say the same about the service. By far the worst in Toronto."}
{"text":"Rip-off! I can get a bigger tastier sandwich for$8.00 less at many other places. They charge up to $2.00 eachfor additional toppings like mushrooms, peppers and cheese. So 1 dinky veal sandwich will run you$15+. It didn't even have all that much flavor. Very disappointed. I had to wait 15 when there were only 3 ppl ahead of me."}
{"text":"OMG, the best veal sandwhiches on the planet, a must if you want a delicious veal, very very tender and juicy.  Great value as well, servings are huge."}
{"text":"Got a veal sandwich with mushrooms and sweet peppers. I asked for less sauce and they happily obliged. Everything about the sandwich was just right. The veal is crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and its not at all greasy."}
{"text":"Who doesn't know everything there is to know about ordering a California Sammy? Step up. Throw down your call. Wait. Take. Eat. Burn. Repeat. The best Italian Sandwich there is in Toronto. (Bring on the naysayers, and the yadda yaddas, I've had them all over). CS is at the top of the game."}
{"text":"Okay have gone here several times now over the past year and have to say maybe they should spend a little less on the decor and building and a little more on customer service and quality.  It is a nice looking location but the service is lacking. Not a big fan of being told by girl at counter to hold on while she talks to the other girl.  then after order two sandwiches, fires, onion rings and olives and waiting over 15 minutes get the sandwiches and am told to go start and they will bring the onion rings and fries in a few.  I guess I am supposed to eat half a meal and then then other half when they gat around to it.  So wait and get the fries and onion rings ($3.50 each for a small paper cup what tasted like cheap Mccains product. and $1.00 for a thin single slice of cheese.)  There is better product out there and in the area.  Just do a search on Yelp and get a product your deserve,  California Sandwich is not what it used to be."}
{"text":"Busy place with OK sandwiches.  A little skimpy on the ingredients compared to other Italian sandwich places in Vaughan and pricier too."}
{"text":"Had a steak sandwich for take-out the other day and was extremely disappointed. The meat was not fresh, it had a very overwhelming smell as if it was expired. I've had a couple of bad experiences with this location but still had given it a chance but not anymore.  If you want to avoid getting sick, skip this place.  You will waste your money and time."}
{"text":"If you want a slab of meat bigger than your head this sandwich shop is for you. This over sized sammy will set you back about $8 but your stomach will assuredly be full. Primarily those around us ordered the veal, both \"sweet\" and plain, we however ventured into the less than popular fare ordering the eggplant parm (also the size of my head) and the meat ball. My sandwich took longer than most but we were out the door in about 5 minutes, so hardly a tragedy. Don't look for any extras (pickles, mayo etc.) though, they only offer six options at $1 to $2 each.  The eggplant parm came with cheese so the $2 addition was unnecessary though some roasted mushrooms might have sent it over the top. But for one of the only vegetarian options it was tasty.  I did notice this restaurant was hardly friendly to the vegetable in general, frying it and coating in tasty marinara. And as per my companion they \"make an adequate meat ball, large but not overly flavorful\". Bottom line...I will visit again when I feel the need for an excess portion of eggplant."}
{"text":"What the hell? So big to finish nor to mention yummy!  Next time you go Californian Sandwiches.  Order one for two!a"}
{"text":"Had another Medium Veal with the works here today. This place is relentless and just keeps serving up great sandwiches.   Veal once again was tender, the breading delicious, and the right amounts of sauce.  It's a 5 out of 5 spot but if I was to make any kind of criticism, I would say to work on the mushrooms a bit and provide a little more sauce."}
{"text":"My girlfriend must be confused as to why I like going to Ikea so much on the Queensway. This is why. I'll always make an appearance here.  WHAT TO ORDER: The Veal, medium so you can taste more of the breading and sauce is easily in my top 5 foods. This location has been consistent and only once or twice have I had my veal be too tough to bite through easily. I've had it from here likely over 50 times. I enjoy the works with mushrooms, onions and cheese but the provolone cheese seems like a requirement. Ask for a fork and you can easily scoop up the great toppings that might escape.  The staff is friendly, the prices are reasonable for a sandwich of this size.   Be prepared to pay cash, their choice.  If you judge this place and dont like veal, then your vote should be scrapped."}
{"text":"My workplace is close by, so we order from here regularly. Absolutely great sandwiches for the price. They are the type that is very messy, so be prepared to use some napkins. If you don't want the full size, be sure to order the mini.  I love a place that understands value. I would be willing to pay more for these."}
{"text":"This is one of the classic Toronto places to grab a bite seated at a table or get takeout for a gang. There's nothing more traditional than a veal sandwich slathered with tomato sauce and loaded with hot or sweet peppers. Simple and delicious. This location has adequate staff that steps up and gets your order filled quickly and efficiently, amen to that! In fact I started checking my phone and didn't notice that my order was ready to go. Prices are decent at under $10 which is also typical of the usual mass produced salty greasy over-packaged food from some neighbouring corporate chain along the Queensway."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Gets pretty busy.   Pros  Good portion   Cons  not worth the price Nothing special for $10"}
{"text":"I wish I could say I liked this place but I didn't. For the price of the barebones sandwich (comes with marinara sauce and jalapeños only), and the add your own topping (at a cost), I was expecting a bit more, but what I got was a messy, sloppy, poorly cut sandwich.  For a place that only serves (pricey) sandwiches, I was hoping for something a bit more gourmet.  I ordered the chicken as which, and the one compliment I can add is that the chicken was extremely well cooked - very juicy."}
{"text":"This place should change its name. It is not California Sandwiches. The sandwiches are small and tasteless and not worth what you pay for it. It is nowhere near as good as the original place on Claremont. That is the only good place to go for California Sandwich. People if you are thinking of going here _STOP at Yonge and College and take the StreetCar over to Little Italy and walk down to the Real California Sandwiches. California Sandwiches has the best veal Sandwich in the city but unfortunately this is not the real deal"}
{"text":"So simple I had turned down wanting to go here a couple of times prior to my first visit, but was I ever wrong. Simple but so great. Pork schnitzel sandwich with the sauce, mushrooms, and onions, I'll be back for another. Sauce is flavourful, schnitzel is crisp, and portion is so huge I needed a fork and knife. Got two meals outta this one."}
{"text":"Cali Sandwiches hits the spot like no other Italian sandwich I know of. I religiously order a medium veal w/ onions and cheese and sauce on the side. Night last, in addition to ordering my sauce on the side, I found the best way to eat this now. I pour the tomato sauce on the sandwich but I don't flood it, and then as I eat I still dip it. This is the perfect way for me to eat it and it ensures I don't have tomato sauce rolling down to my elbows.   I could eat here easily 3 times a week, and my record is 1 veal and half a chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"What a joke over $16 for a veal sandwich 12 olives and a can of pop..that well be my last time there!!  For just a sandwich lol you could get big dinners for that price .. I have it 1 star cause I liked the pop"}
{"text":"Another best of Toronto: veal sandwiches that is. It really is. The décor adds nothing and the venue itself looks like some school cafeteria, but these sandwiches are the bomb diggity bomb. A can of Brio is the only other thing I need.   Although the business has grown in size (there are now eight locations to date), every sandwich tastes as good as my last. Now that's just like Momma's cooking."}
{"text":"Hi  Went there yesterday and ordered mild  chicken and steak sandwich.  It was extremely salty I had to drink water all night because of that.   It was my last time there."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were good size but price tag is large size as well. Any toppings are extra $ (extra $2 for rapini!), including toppings you might expect to be included for the price.  All in, 2 sandwiches (1 topping each), 1 soup and 1 can of pop came to over 30 bucks.  On a sidenote: I would probably offer 4 stars but they don't accept credit cards and charge $.25 to use the debit! Now I generally think passing along debit fees to the customer is an irritatingly cheap business practice but when you are making such a profit off debit transactions (it costs a merchant 5 cents) I think it's worthy of lowering a rating."}
{"text":"If you crave italian sandwiches, you can't get any better than the original California sandwiches. You can truly tell this place is family run and the food tastes like heaven. If you want a flashier looking place, you can try some of the newer stores they've been opening up around the GTA but nothing beats this location for me."}
{"text":"I could eat this everyday. Sooooo good. Sandwiches are huge. Eggplant parmesan, veal Parm, everything eat it all."}
{"text":"holy crap! maybe because i'm drunk as hell but man, california sandwiches makes an awesome leftover sandwich. i went here for the first time with co-workers and as austere as the surroundings may be (hell, i've rode my bike past here on many occasions without even noticing there was a food joint here), the food really hits the spot. it's like a bunch of people's nona's working in the back. the eggplant sandwich is huge! i just ate the other half after it had been sitting in my purse for a few hours and it still tastes good! just a little bit of nuking and voila! the sogginess disappears! seriously, if you're craving a coronary, this place is perfect!"}
{"text":"Big sandwiches for the price. We tried steak with cheese & onions and eggplant parmigiana. The sandwiches were much bigger than we expected. In terms of taste the steak & onion delivers exactly what you would expect. Very filling and satisfying. Eggplant parmigiana on the other hand had a weird bitter taste. Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night and they were very busy, but seating was not an issue since they have lots of  tables.   I ordered the spicy veal sandwich with cheese and grilled veggies. It was pretty good, but like other reviewers I would probably ask for a little more sauce next time.  I think the sandwich came to around $10ish."}
{"text":"Clean place, surprisingly good music (Nirvana playing at the moment). Their sandwiches are fairly sloppy and big, so keep that in mind when coming in."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried their veal sandwich yet then you're missing out.  They have other types of sandwiches on their limited menu but I have yet to try another option.  It's big, it's messy, but it's so good!  I was addicted after the first bite.  Any toppings you want on your sandwich will cost you extra.  They take cash only (ATM on site), and there's a bit of a wait if you don't call ahead & place your order."}
{"text":"I could take or leave California Sandwiches.  This chain has become the go-to place for the Woodbridge gino crowd looking for a sangwich and so the owners know how to milk those guys for all they are worth.  There are a lot of good sandwich places around and for a MUCH better value.  They are stingy with their toppings (that cost an arm and a leg) and only take cash (which, to me, is kind of sketchy).  Big ole MEH on this place for me."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying these delicious sandwiches for years! I'm surprised I've never reviewed them before.  Serving up amazing veal, steak, eggplant and meatball sandwiches (chicken and sausage are just ok) on outstanding kaiser rolls with perfectly garlicky fresh house-made tomato sauce and your choice of \"sweet\" (mild), \"medium\" or \"hot\", which corresponds to how much diced roasted jalepeño is added.  The veal for each sandwich is individually fried up fresh and crisp when you order it, then topped with sauce and your toppings, plus the appropriate amount of jalapeño heat, and each one is absolutely delicious.  The sandwiches are always a huge mess due to the amount of meat and all the sauce that goes on, so grab lots of napkins, but they have not been soaking for hours in some steam table tray full of sauce, so they are simultaneously crispy and crunchy at some parts, yet saucy and garlicky at others, a total treat!  The steak is thin and not breaded but seared up quick in a saute pan, with the same sauce and onions standard. And the meatball is an enormous grapefruit-sized monster that is loaded with beef and bread crumbs, chopped onto the bun, then covered with sauce and your toppings.  It's so super-tender that it practically melts in your mouth.  This location and the original Claremont Street location are both the real deal, but all 14 locations around the city are apparently family owned and operated - so check it out, I'm sure you will love it!"}
{"text":"One of the Best Italian Sandwich shops in Toronto, a long time favorite of many, well hidden but well worth trying!"}
{"text":"went here for lunch because a coworker recommended it. for $7.75, i got me the veal cutlet.  sandwich was big.. not that big.. but big.  damn tasty but i wish there was more green on it.  just to balance out the meat.  totally recommend it to those who want a tasty sandwich.  some of you might get super full.. some would want a 2nd!!  food is pricey but it's one of a kind! haven't seen any other sandwich shops like this around.  i will be back to eat again!"}
{"text":"Got the spicy veal sandwich for a late lunch. Huge sandwich, great price and super tasty, what more can you ask for? I usually go to the little italy location but I've also been to the location on dufferin and there's no difference in terms of quality between the locations. The olives on the side is also really tasty, as is the eggplant sandwich, which I have also had a few times."}
{"text":"I ordered a veal sandwich, with peppers, onion, mushrooms. I certainly can't complain about the sheer volume of this thing; the taste however; is another thing. It had an \"odd taste\" to it; not pleasant; perhaps it may have been a bit better if they had mozzerella as an option to the provolone & piled on the extras a little less . I'll pick quality over quantity everytime. ..... it certainly doesn't rate with Bitondo's, San Francesco's; Commiso's, or Longo's in Markham. The only thing that really stands out, is the service - THAT; was very, very  pleasant."}
{"text":"I love this place although I try to only treat myself once in a while because of HOW GIGANTIC THE SANDWICH IS. Good luck eating the whole thing.  I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the eggplant sandwich, clutch toppings: hot peppers, onion, mushrooms and cheese!! Get a side order of olives too, take your food to Bellwoods and enjoy a perfect meal."}
{"text":"California sandwiches is quality. It has a great bang for your buck with their sizes of sandwiches,  variety of meats and toppings! Service is fast and i have never had a bad experience or  product. Always fresh and flavourful meals which is a great hunger fix 100percent"}
{"text":"Not a bad wait for the food. All in all was at a table with my order of this gigantic veal sandwich within 5-10 mins. The sandwich itself was absolutely delicious! In fact this pig could easily have ordered and devoured a 2nd one (Oink oink) was told to go visit the original location at dundas and Claremont which apparently is even more delicious. Will definitely follow up on that!"}
{"text":"Great Newer Location! Same Great Food and Service! Expanded there menu! If you like a big sandwich they have the best!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich in the city. Been going there for years the Veal sandwich yummy  for those that never tried it you have too."}
{"text":"Yummy, messy goodness. I was visiting from the US and had to try this place. So glad I did. The veal sandwich was great!"}
{"text":"I was so glad to find out there is a Yonge location of California Sandwich!!!  I used to go to the Dufferin location and always found the food amazing! This location only has the sandwiches, and they are delicious and a very good portion.You just gotta try it!!"}
{"text":"The buns are really really cheap and not indicative of what Italians eat with their veal sandwiches. The veal is good but the pricey toppings don't make it worth the price. The meatballs in the meatball sandwiches consist of 90% bread and 10% meat and are bland and tasteless. Other locations may be better but I am not willing to try them out, I've made better sandwiches at home."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant.  Great modern looks and a pleasant atmosphere with plenty of seats. Very clean. I had the spicy sausage and onion sandwich for lunch. The portion was more than I expected. This was a pretty large sandwich with a full sausage sliced up from what I can tell. It was nice and spicy but most importantly delicious!  I usually eat more than one sandwich but I was stuffed and happy after this one.  I would definitely recommend stopping by if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I love you.  That's all there is to say.  No ambiance other than the ammount of people watching that you can do here because it's always packed.  Here's what I get    Eggplant parmesan with cheese onions and hot peppers.   I have tried all of them. Even as an avid meat eater, the eggplant kicks ass.   But if you want a veal parm sandwich it would be crazy to go anywhere else. Winter is coming and this is the b"}
{"text":"this became the worst sandwich restaurant in mississauga. i tried this place 5 years ago and they were awesome. now they are the worse. sandwich is large bread full of nothing. the meat they are using has no taste. do not go there."}
{"text":"It's the same Veal Parmesan perfection I remember from years ago when I lived in the neighborhood. Travelled all the way from East side 6 last month to feed a longtime craving for some real Italian food and Mamma Mia my old friends never disappoint.  The peppers lovingly roasted with green herbs just like Ma used to make, God rest her soul.   Fresh top shelf buns as always the foundation to any gourmet sandwich.   The Veal cooked to soft perfection will make your tastebuds SING.  Took my Olive Garden Variety Girlfriend to show her how it's done in the old country, promised to bring her back for some Gelato is she'll promise to stop overcooking my pasta. Rest in peace Ma you always cooked with the very best olive oil what am I gonna do with this one?  Special thanks for the superb service from the sweet ladies at the front I loved the sandwich."}
{"text":"I love me my veal.  I love this place.  I have been a few times, and each experience has been enjoyable.  I am so full that I could be rolled out....but damn....it is worth it.  The women who work here look miserable.  They can fry up a mean piece of meat, but they are like robots...friendly robots.  The fried veal is amazing.  Like butter, not greasy, just perfect.  I can't recommend it enough.  In fact, I am getting hungry just thinking and writing this!  My favourite sights at California Sandwiches - seeing a side of beef being delivered through the side door, watching the women stir the huge pot of sauce with a boat sized paddle, the array of customers (construction, suits, mom and kids) and seeing the people who order the double meat sandwiches (which I am sure would inflict major meat sweats)."}
{"text":"Oh man, I covet the veal sandwich.  California Sandwiches never disappoints in providing me, hands down, the best veal on a bun I have ever had.    The mammoth of a sandwich is best consumed when you have not eaten anything all day.  You really do need to prepare to ingest such a large sammy.    My preference is to get my sandwich with mushrooms and peppers.  The super thin pieces of breaded veal are not greasy at all.  It is like Nona is back there taking extra care of the veal, and her customers.  The tomato sauce is light, not too heavy, and the kaiser rolls are always super fresh.  Now, the real skill when eating one of these sandwiches is, do not (I repeat), do not put the sandwich down once you have picked it up.  Once you start the journey, there is no looking back, and there is no putting the sandwich down.  If you put the sandwich down, because it is so big and luscious and saucy, you will never be able to pick it up again in one piece.  I would normally give California Sandwiches a 6 out of 5, but this location is so sad.  Be sure to checkout some of the pictures that have been posted.  The basement is a scene from a horror flick, and the area upstairs needs a reno so, so, so, so badly.  Extremely bad use of space, and it is not inviting at all.  If you want the full on experience, check out the California Sandwiches location in Downsview.  At any rate, whatever location you visit, the veal sandwich is superb.  Actually just writing this, I am craving one right now.  Even though this location gives me the creeps."}
{"text":"Wow, the veal sandwich shares zero quality to the original on Claremont. Sauce tasted of can. Veal anemic. Bread stale. It was overall very subpar.  I feel like I was blindsided. The only upside was that I did not get sick. Head office should do regular inspections so that standards are maintained. If quality cannot be maintained then name/franchise should be revoked."}
{"text":"Massive sandwiches, I go here to get my fix of Veal and it satisfies me everytime. Poor service though, ive been here mutiple times, and have never felt welcomed. 8 bucks for a sandwich the size of my head is a decent price I guess.."}
{"text":"The veal sandwich here is at best average. The portion was filling for one person at around $10 per sandwich. However, the service here is not the best. As it was my first time here, I ask the cashier if I could with my credit card. He pointed at a sign saying cash & debit only and proceeds to serve the person after me. Then when my sandwich was ready, the lady who was preparing it threw the sandwich on the counter in a harsh manner. Although the sandwich is not bad, the service and experiences I had here would not prompt me to return."}
{"text":"I grew up a couple of blocks from the original location and I have been eating these sandwiches for almost 50 years. Not much has changed here - it is still small and cramped when it gets busy, the same families own the place, although it is the children and grandchildren running the place now. It's all about the sandwiches. Big, messy, not cheap, and truly delicious - they are the epitome of the Italian sandwich. My order hasn't changed since I was a kid - medium veal with extra onions and extra sauce. The little kick of the hot pepper balances out the sweetness of the onion and that rich sauce makes the mound of deliciously breaded veal in the huge kaiser roll all slippy and sloppy going down. Damn, that's good! I still order a chocolate milk to wash it down and cut the heat if I bite off too much pepper. Forget decor, forget low carb or low whatever diet, this is pure hedonism and a blast from the past. Grab a sandwich, get messy, and feel the love. I do every time."}
{"text":"Over the past 20 years I've probably had 100 of these veal sandwiches.  Out of those maybe 3-4 have been \"ok\".  The rest have been amazing.  I always order a sweet veal with cheese and mushrooms, extra sauce.  My wife orders the meatball.  Unfortunately as I get older I need to watch my meat intake so California's has now become a yearly eating experience.  I am looking forward to next September.  Tip:  To avoid the line up call 15 minutes ahead and place your order.  It should be ready or close to ready when you arrive."}
{"text":"I don't eat veal so I always get the chicken parm, which never disappoints. I've been coming here for about 5 years or so. I always get mine spicy. I love that they started doing mini burgers, as I usually can't (shouldn't? ha) finish a whole one in one sitting. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the California Sandwiches chain and this location in particular. It's very clean, modern with decent parking.   All the sandwiches are massive so if you're not that hungry, you may want to look at the smaller sized offerings.   I've tried the chicken, eggplant and of course their famous veal. All are perfectly seasoned, fried fresh to order and come with the tangy, delicious tomato sauce. I normally only add their sautéed onions, but they do have several choices to personalize your sandwich."}
{"text":"I love their Chicken Sandwich, as it is cooked to perfection,. and you get enough to be full. They are always busy, and know their customers from frequency. My wife enjoys the Steak Sandwich, as it is the best in town. Great food, great staff, and most of all great prices."}
{"text":"First rule of California Sandwiches, \"You don't talk about the horrible geographical locations where they place their franchises.\" Seriously, all three CS locations that I know of in Toronto are in the middle of nowhere and not easily accessible.   This location is as nondescript as they come. It is in front of a high school and it is smack in the middle of a residential neighbourhood. Almost as if a ninja sneaked into Toronto's city planning office and changed the zoning of the block just to piss off the older crowd who seat on their porches for sport across the street and simply watch you go in... and out. Mumbling something among themselves as you walk by.   As far as the quality of the sandwiches, they are orgasmically delicious.  They are juicy, spicy and tasty and although the health benefits or its aorta blocking powers can at times be questionable or concerning, your taste buds will try their best to distract your brain away from such thoughts. Just  eat somewhat fast because there is a soggy half-life with these sandwiches.   Generally I get a chicken or veal sandwiches --no, I do not feel guilty about it, okay? It is now closer to God's loving embrace. :P And they have yet to disappoint.  Even though the sandwiches are quite large, by the end of a meal, you come out feeling good and full, unlike McDonald's or other fast food joints where you come out feeling gross and dirty.   So if you haven't had a California Sandwich, then it is not too late. Have one. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"A client recommended this place last year for lunch and it was great! So the other day we went back! Such big sandwiches & great prices! Delicious!!! Nice staff & nice clean space!"}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches. There is something slightly different about their sandwiches compared to the original location on Claremont.   That being said; since I work close by I have been able to try the other sandwiches. The steak comes with sautéed onions so I added the provolone cheese and it was just like a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich!   I've had the veal and the meatball. Good size sandwiches for a fair price. The space is clean and the staff is usually friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious italian sandwiches -- breaded veal on a soft bun with tomato sauce.   They look big, but they're very airy, so they're not as big as all that.  They've been doing this a long time and they have a reputation.  The prices are a little high, particularly on the add-ons and the service feels a little arrogant at times, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Have been buying a veal sandwich ever year I go to Toronto. Like a tradition for 25 years. I remember it when it was hole in the wall near Dundas St in downtown Toronto. I just had my fix yesterday  and It was as good as the first one was 25 years ago."}
{"text":"Not as good as the location on Claremont, but still a solid place to get a good chicken sandwich.   The place is huge and really modern, pretty much the opposite of the original location.  The food comes quickly, the guy at the counter is really friendly, and they sell gelato! You order from the counter and they call out your number when it's ready.  The chicken sandwiches are huge and delicious. They use the same hot peppers as the Claremont location, which is one of my favourite things about California Sandwiches.   There's a little patio outside, but it's right on a gross street with lots of cars, so it's not really ideal.  If I'm in the area, I'll check them out again."}
{"text":"My wife and I regularly eat their sandwiches and we were happy they opened this location as it's closer to our home but the sauce is slightly different from all other locations. The sauce here has a slightly heavier taste and the spice in the sauce is different. The other locations all taste the same with each other."}
{"text":"I have not eaten this in a while and then today I had a craving to go have a veal sandwich here.  This place never disappoints.  The prices are a bit high  but portions more than make up for it.  There is 2 large pieces of veal in the sandwich and it was so hard going back to work and not taking a nap, if you eat the whole thing you will be very full.     Would definitely be going back.  If you are looking for a hardy sandwich to tide you over all day this is the place to go."}
{"text":"There a many California Sandwiches in the GTA and I've been to about four other places, but this place has been top notch from the rest.  I'm all about the medium chicken sandwich with cheese. Medium, meaning the spice level. I don't want to overload the sandwich with any other ingredients unless I'm starved and would end up adding onions and mushrooms.  Here are some tips: 1. If you want to take it home or take away, ask to have the sauce separate so it won't get all soggy when you bring it home or to work. 2. Remember your number!! They will call out your number when your order is ready. 3. It's cash only. They do have ATM machines in the store. 4. If you eat it there, make sure you have enough napkins and enjoy.  Oh and yeah, from reading the other reviews here. The meatball and steak sandwich isn't the greatest. I've tried both of them and ended up never ordering those again."}
{"text":"Massive, soggy, hot sandwiches dripping with juice. MMmmmmmmmm  With American sized (read: extra large) portions, California Sandwiches makes sandwiches fun again, (almost) making me forget about those day-in-day-out sandwiches I'd pack in elementary school.   Sandwiches run about $10, and an extra $1 for additional toppings, and will cost you a lot of calories, but once in a while you just feel like you want a big hearty sandwich dripping with juiciness.  And when those cravings hit when I'm at work, this is where I go.  Veal, Beef and chicken are all good from what I've tried."}
{"text":"Ordered the veal with veggies, and chicken with rapini. Both were tasty, but my friend and I preferred the chicken. Very large sandwiches and super filling.   It was a lot of bread."}
{"text":"FUCK YEAHHHHHH CALIFORNIA SANDWICHES!!!!!  Chicken is definitely better than the veal, because it's a thicker cut of chicken and even more tender. Also ALWAYS spring for the sauteed mushrooms and cheese, can't go without the cheese. Cheese separates a real sandwich from a sad one"}
{"text":"[Snoop Dogg] Greetings loved ones Let's take a journey  [Katy Perry ] I know a place Where the veal is really leaner Warm, wet and wild There must be somethin' in the sauce Sippin' pepsi or juice Food's layin' underneath the heating lamps (Undone) The boys Break their necks Try'na creep a little sneak peek (At us)  You could travel the world But nothing comes close To the Golden Coast Once you party with us You'll be falling in love Oooooh oh oooooh  California Sandwiches They're a little forgettable Veal or Chicken Onions on top Sun-roasted peppers So hot They'll melt your Popsicle Oooooh oh oooooh   -----  Solid, messy, saucy sandwiches.. A little pricey for a Sausage Sandwich and pop for $11 no?  Good, but I'd rather pick up something from woodbridge/little italy or the Bistro Basillico in Scaborough."}
{"text":"Its close to me and I love me a good italian sandwich. I have been visiting the Chesswood location for over 15 years and I love that stuff- however this location let me down and I tell you why:  The place has everything going for it- amazing building - lots of parking- lots of seating- tv screens and a bar. This is California sandwich showing off that they made it. They even have an amazing gelato bar.  What let me down was the actual sandwich- i was going to give my benefit of the doubt because I ordered take out and I thought the bun was effected by that. The bun was not good- not toasted well and soggy. Bun aside -My chicken cutlet was not done properly as the breaded portion was falling off the chicken making my sandwich incredibly hard to eat.  It was still good- but not as good the chesswood location."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great sandwiches, look no further! California sandwiches has the best veal sandwich that i have ever had. Great service, but limited parking."}
{"text":"I had the veal with cheese and peppers along with some juice, it ended up costing a little over $12, and like has already been mentioned, no interac service, not sure why. The bread was terrible, for spending $12, you'd think that the bread would be fresh, I can get a veal for $7 with nice bread, the quantity was large, but have had better."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5/5  My co-worker and I were deciding what to get on our breaks as we were browsing we came across this location. We both ordered Mini Chicken Parmesan sandwich with an order of fries.   I had ordered it before I left work and by the time I got there the food was ready. The sandwich tasted good but the only thing is the chicken wasn't the best! It seemed a little rubbery which kind of sucked. But the fries tasted amazing!   Overall the staff was really friendly and the store was spotless. I will give it one more try to see if it was just that day. But by reading all the reviews looks like I wasn't the only one that had a rubbery chicken."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered a Sausage Sandwich. First off, let me tell you that the portions are HUGE. I wasn't able to finish my sandwich and actually ended up having the rest later as a snack.   I liked that they didn't skimp out on the tomato sauce as I felt it made it more flavourful. However, eating the sandwich got very messy very fast as the sausages kept sliding out and the buns got soggy from the sauce. While I liked the Sausage Sandwich, my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Sandwich which I liked a lot better as it was breaded nicely and easier to eat. The one complaint I have is that the bread took away from the flavours of the sandwich as it was very plain and not soft enough for my liking.   Overall, California Sandwiches is definitely a good place to visit after you've worked up an appetite."}
{"text":"Yum yum! This is original location, even my parents went here back when they were in elementary school and they used to buy \"sauce buns\" for lunch for a dollar. I love that it's a family business and it's nice to see that they have been successful and have expanded to new locations. However I still love this location the best. I always get the sweet veal, you can't go wrong! The sandwiches are massive!!!!!! And they give you soo much meat, also the sauce is delicious!! You can't buy sandwiches like this at any other restaurant because they would charge you an arm and a leg for all the meat.   I have also tried the meatball and the eggplant Parmesan sandwich, both equally delicious... but I always go back to the sweet veal!  Cash only but they have an ATM inside."}
{"text":"California Sandwiches is on the south west corner of Treford and Claremont which is in a residential area.  This area is between Ossington and Bathurst (east/west) and between College and Dundas (north/south).    Yes, the original California Sandwiches is in the middle of a residential neighborhood being that it's Little Italy and hidden from the main strip of Little Italy on College, this place is one of those best kept secrets type of places.  The thing is it's no secret that this place has been around for decades.  When I was working in the area as a courier decades ago I used to pop into this place and even though the inside has changed over the years with an updated interior, the outside building pretty much looks the same.  I was meeting a friend here around 1pm on a weekday and while this would be my second sandwich in about 3 hours that was okay.  The first sandwich coincidentally was also 9.50 and it was a breakfast sandwich in Kensington Market.  This go around we're talking a large, really large old school veal sandwich but I did however add provolone.  Toronto and the surrounding area have quite a few California Sandwiches now.  I go to the one in Burlington once in a while.  I know there's one on Winston Churchill in Oakville and the closest one to where I live is on the Queensway in Etobicoke.  They've expanded out from their original location in Little Italy and it's one of those local success stories.  I can say that across the other locations I've been to that their product is consistent.  The quality, portion and offerings in general are pretty much the same at each location but there's something special about coming to the original.  I ordered my usual which was a medium (heat as in peppers) veal with provolone.  I mean for a sandwich that just breaks 10 bucks one may think hmmm that's kind of expensive.  You would probably think that if you didn't know what you'd be getting after the order was ready for pickup.  Yes it's a sandwich but it's not just any sandwich.  This isn't some sort of cute little portion of a sandwich, NOPE.  To put it into perspective the when it's wrapped and they give you anywhere from a half inch to an inch of napkins (you'll need them, trust me) this thing is probably 8 inches in diameter and weighs easily around a pound and a half to two pounds.  If you don't believe it, go there and order one.  The sandwich is cut in half but each half is what could be considered its own sandwich and now you're just eating 2 regular sized sandwiches.  These things are big, get it?  They're not small.  Generosity is a thing at this place.  You won't get cheated, buy 3 and compare the 3 and see if one is smaller than another and good luck with that.  This place has been doing the same thing so long that they're just the masters of what they do.  Layers of veal, melted cheese, lots of sauce all on a huge Kaiser type roll.  Huge.  Unlike the other locations that I believe take other forms of payment, I'm pretty sure this location hasn't changed and they only take cash."}
{"text":"I ordered the sausage with onion sandwich. Didn't enjoy the bun as it was really tough and took some strength to bite into it. Also didn't enjoy the sauce that goes in all the sandwiches, bland and makes the sandwich really soggy. The sausage was also no good, dry and boring. However the fries were decent."}
{"text":"Tried the steak sandwich - can't say much about service because I ordered using the kiosk- but I definitely won't be visiting again. The meat was ridiculously tough and chewy, bread was soggy, and the sauce seemed very out of place in the sandwich. Considering the relatively small size of the sandwich, the $10 price was quite ridiculous, especially for such an underwhelming meal. I usually don't put up a fuss about how long it takes to be made, but the store was almost completely empty and the food was also cold by the time it got to me."}
{"text":"As far as sandwiches go this place sure knows how to make them.  Veal, meatball, chicken, steak, even eggplant and veggies on a bun for those that don't eat meat.  My favorite is a medium (hot) veal with cheese.  You can add on peppers, mushrooms etc for other toppings as well.  The sandwich are larger than your average sandwiches.  At times I have had a lot of meat on mine and sometimes less.  There is really no consistency for veal I have to say that is about the only knock I can think of because the food itself is really good.  The buns are always crusty, fresh buns and they absorb the sauce but you will still need a stack of napkins because they are almost always messy.    All the California sandwich locations I have been to are all the same, you line up, order, pay and get your receipt with your number.  They'll call you up when yours is ready.    They've been around for decades and now have many locations all around the GTA."}
{"text":"Veal sandwich was tender and delicious! The girl working behind the counter was very nice! Will definitely be returning and highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Tremendous sandwiches. Not solely based on size mind you, but these sammies are hefty, packed with nicely breaded slices of fried veal, a simple tomato sauce and whatever toppings you please. Mind you, I'm not a fan of the fact that you have to pay $1.00 extra for most toppings, $1.00 for canned mushrooms anyone? Ughhh but they do enhance one's baby cow sandwich eating experience. This place is mad popular on lunches, can be a bit crazy with the queue of blue collar types, kids and working professionals all waiting for their bit of hoagie heaven.   Have a half for lunch and save the rest for later."}
{"text":"Most horrible sandwich place ever.  Had the roast beef it was simply tough hospital food like boiled beef on a bun.  What a rip off $9.   Actually hospital food would be better than this place.   Zero stars!!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious.  I love the veal with cheese and the steak sandwiches.  I noticed that they put a lot more sauce here compared to the location on Dufferin and that's why I think the Scarborough location is the best! I haven't been to the other ones though."}
{"text":"I had people convince me to go to this place, and I left less than pleased.  I found the sandwiches quite dry and I'm sorry $1 for toppings is just bizarre to me.  The place was small and the servers weren't really in the mood to serve us. Oh well now I'm not in the mood to return there."}
{"text":"Not only are Cali sandwiches the best around, at this specific location the staff is amazing! I try to come once a week with my coworkers for lunch and the staff is amazing towards us! Always taking care of us and making sure we are in and out to get right back to work!   The sandwiches are huge when it comes to the veal, steak and chicken, all these make you want a nap after eating one! The sauce is amazing and the mess you create is the best part. I love to get a large container of olives as well because they are amazing!"}
{"text":"Used to go to the one on the queensway when I worked by it, as amazing as I remembered when I lived in Toronto before, best veal sandwich on the planet I think !"}
{"text":"Disappointing not the same as the Toronto or Queensway actually  far from it, this Mississauga outlet off of mavis is cheap on the meat actually it was probably a good thing because it was so veiny and chewy one bite and the whole sandwich came read out of the bun the meat wouldn't separate. Girls at the front counter like zombies no one knows what to say or do. I actually frequent California sandwiches it's like a treat to go there on the Queensway, I don't know if this is a franchise or not, But this is not the same California that I have come to know."}
{"text":"This place is consistent always meaty fresh staff of people are great/ family run business this is what a veal Italian sandwich should taste like fantastic bravo to you"}
{"text":"Don't need to post a photo; the ones already here are the same.  Ordered through Skip The Dishes. Meal arrived warm; courier was friendly, clean and handled the food carefully.  Packaged well so no spillage in the bag.  The buns were fresh and squishy so ask to have the sauce on the side for delivery; they are happy to accomodate.  The meat is tender with no gristle and had a light crisp breading.  The tomato sauce is home-made; it's not tomato paste, but flavourful stewed tomatoes and it's wonderful. There are no seeds or peels in it but there are small chunks of tomato.  Portions are generous and satisfying.  The food isn't salty or greasy; it's just right.  The milk is a large carton, not in a plastic bottle.  Very happy that we've found another place with good food prepared well."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to California Sandwiches about 14 years ago in Little Italy of TO and had no idea they expanded this much.  When I saw this place I had to pop in get something.  I can't remember if the Little Italy place had sides way back when but when I saw all they had to offer, I was blown away.  It was quite a selection but I'm here for the sandwich. I ended up getting a hot veal just like I did when I was a wee lad.  Back then my mommy ordered for me :) so I don't know if there were all these toppings to add way back but like a rookie I screwed up my order.   Uhmm.... I suppose I will get cheese with it and ermm....... Mushrooms and hot peppers?  Yeah, that sound like enough.  Oh and an OJ.   The sandwich looked exactly how I remembered.... Big and sloppy.  Now I'm excited.   Half way through the first have of the sandwich, I realize the thing isn't hot like I remember.  In fact it's much hotter.... That or I've become a bit of a wuss.  I started getting the sweats which was brutal but I powered through that and demolished the whole thing because it was delicious.  I didn't really notice the cheese or what it did for the sandwich as it was over powered by the raging heat and other than the given sloppiness, the sandwich more or less held up the entire time despite the odd  patch of some sogginess.  I think I've also had the sausage and chicken when I was younger and they too were delicious..   Next time I come here I'm going to attempt to get a side dish but who knows.  The sandwiches eat like a meal themselves.  Definitely worth checking out at least one of the  CS.X"}
{"text":"Seriously loved the chicken cutlet sandwich with sweet peppers here! And detail that is rather important for me, they have expresso coffees!!"}
{"text":"I remember watching my parents eat these things when I was a kid, wondering why the hell they would have such cravings for horrifyingly large sandwiches that made the whole house smell funny. My dad would bring them home and it was suuuuch a big deal. But now I get it. I GET IT, OKAY?  I think my favourite part is how the cheese gets all melty and stretchy...   Ugh. Now I want one.   DINNER. YES."}
{"text":"Headline: Not a \"light\" sandwich/lunch.  I went here hoping for a light lunch as I figured, \"it's just a sandwich\". Yeah, that didn't pan out as the sandwiches are huge.  The basic premise is:  1. Order your type of sandwich 2. Add toppings (of which they cost anywhere between $0.99 and $1.50 each), with the exception of onions and jalapeno peppers 3. Eat it  I got the veal sandwich which was 7.74 and added eggplant and onions.  Total came to around $10.50 including taxes.    The sandwich is made to order, so it takes around 5 to 7 minutes to prepare, which is fine.  As for the meat itself, the veal was very nicely breaded, crispy, but not hard and the sauce on it tasted so good.  It's a light tomato sauce and I don't even like tomatoes that much, but it seemed to go very well with eggplant, veal and onions.  The sandwich itself is large and will definitely fill up those with the biggest appetite.    My only pet peeve is that the girl at the counter seemed like she was in a daze. I asked her \"is the sausage spicy?\" and she answered in a muttered tone \"I don't think so??\".    Verdict: Great hot sandwich place to take a breather while you are in Heartland."}
{"text":"Huge veal sandwich fresh bun added mushrooms and I got a mild.  This is still the king in Etobicoke.  I could only eat 1/2 and took the rest home. Surprised that service was so fast just after one p.m. Not as busy as I remember  I always will go back. Private parking lot BUT BURGERS PRIEST OPENING NEXT DOOR!!"}
{"text":"Good italian food. Definitely not fast food quality or prices. Just a little bit higher but well worth it. Try the \"3 choices\" with gnocci, eggplant parm and chicken"}
{"text":"Went there last week for dinner after work and ordered the chicken sandwich with Xtra sauce. The sauce tasted great and the order was correct but the chicken was over fried and the oil must have been old....disappointing to see."}
{"text":"My buddy took me to this location my first time a few years ago.  Family owned and run it's simply my favourite place for a chicken Parma sandwich with peppers and mushrooms.  You can get veal and more.  I even heard it was sooooo good.  Some guy was crazy enough to have it FEDEXED to Vancouver so he could have it for dinner.  Now that's something!!!!  Remember those old Batman TV shows where the words KAPOW!  WHAM! BAM! would pop up on the tv screen?  That's what this food does for me!  Oh, I give this 5 thumbs up. No problemo.  Everytime I'm in Tornto area, I have to make a visit here at least once!  mangi! mangi! mangi!"}
{"text":"The Food:  The eggplant sandwich is a great meat alternative. Although I'm not a vegetarian, I've fallen in love with this sandwich. Add some mushrooms and peppers and it's heaven. Maybe next time, I'll add some cheese on it. It's wonderful that they have the \"mini\" size version of the sandwich for under $5. I use quotes around mini because it is still such a generous size. My sister, who somehow had the idea that CS served deli sandwiches was pleasantly surprised. She couldn't stop gushing about how good it was and even thanked me for suggesting to come here. She ordered the regular sized chicken sandwich, added cheese and peppers and shared it with her boyfriend. We also got an order of the sweet potato fries for only$3.50. They were very good. Sweet and crispy.  The Place:  I really liked this location because it is quite spacious and is really clean. The bathroom is also very clean and that's a plus because you will definitely be using it to wash your hands after you eat the delicious, but messy sandwich.  The Service:  It's a fast food joint, so we didn't have a waitress, but the cashier was really friendly.  The Verdict: I wish they would open one closer to where I live. I'd go there all the time!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, hot, fresh, huge portions, can't complain about the food but you are right about customer service. The managers/owners are good after all it's their business to be nice, the kids who answer the phone....ahhh terrible customer service. So all in all food is good if you can tolerate the snotty kid who answers the phone"}
{"text":"My experience at this place was horrendous. I was very excited to try their sandwich because I heard good things about the place.   First off, the cashier had a very bad attitude. She took one order then made us wait in the line while she punched in all the take-out orders.   Secondly, don't be mistaken by the \"free\" jalapeño peppers. They are only free if they are in the sandwich and NOT if you ask for it on the side.   This place gets very busy during lunch hours, with a line out of the door. We tried the veal sandwich with added toppings (provolone, mushrooms, and onions) Overall, the sandwich was not bad, but would definitely not come during busy times. It is also pretty pricey for a sandwich - came to 15$ in the end."}
{"text":"I ordered through Grabb. So my order was made quickly and already ready when I got there. The place was completely empty when I got there (it was just a bit before 6).  The sandwiches were very big and I could only eat half. But I found that it wasn't all that great. I ordered the steak sandwich with \"sweet sauce\". The meat was a bit tough and the bread was kind of soggy. The sauce was more sour and tomato-y than sweet.  All in all, disappointed with my meal. Won't go back since it is quite expensive as they charge for each additional ingredient"}
{"text":"We didn't care for it. I've never been to a California Sandwiches before, so perhaps this is my fault. I was expecting lots of fresh veggies, (think avocados) colorful, healthy.... instead everything was fried, brown and unhealthy. Nothing looked appetizing and I wanted to go, but I did try the chicken. Meat with lots of sauce on a big carb ridden bun. Haha. It was good but expensive I thought. The veal seems popular but I don't eat veal and I believe it's fried. Any other toppings were extra. I prefer Subway Sandwiches to be honest. At least you can get veggies there & it's cheaper."}
{"text":"Sometimes their chicken sandwich is a hit or miss depending on the amount of tomatoe sauce they use. I understand that some people don't like it all saucy and messy, but your wrong! It's all about the saaaaaucee. My most recent experience earlier this evening was not good at all. The sandwich was dry and I had to guzzle down some soda to get it down my throat. Even with that being said, I'm not gonna give up on them, and i'll be asking for extra sugo next time!"}
{"text":"In the 70's in Toronto there was an amazing small chain of Italian Sandwiches and they were delish......but OMG - here this is the Biggest sandwich EVER here and it was amazing (even though I could only eat half).     Ordered the Veal with mushrooms and onion. Served on on a huge Kaiser bun with tomato sauce.   You order at the counter and less than 2 min my sandwich was ready - popping hot and so yummy !   They also have salads and a variety of other sandwiches like; steak wonton, chicken, chicken deluxe, sausage wonton, meatball, eggplant, grilled veggie and a mini. And you can choose for a large number of toppings.   Get lots of napkins cause it's messy !!!"}
{"text":"There isn't much in the way of Italian food in Scarborough, however if you are having a craving for some Italian eats you will be hard pressed to find something better than California Sandwiches.   This place is a good hybrid between fast food/takeout place and sit down restaurant. You walk in and order at the counter, wait for your number to be called and prepare to dig in. What makes it different from a regular fast food joint is that they cook everything fresh to order, and they also have a liquor license so you can enjoy a cold beer or an Italian liqueur with your meal.   On my latest visit I came for some takeout, I walked into a packed restaurant but the line moved quickly. After placing my order I had to wait about 10 minutes for my food to be cooked. I got a veal sandwich topped with provolone, onions, mushrooms and hot peppers. The sandwich is massive, the veal is lightly breaded, very tender and drenched in an amazing sweet tomato sauce, add melted cheese to the equation and you have heaven in a bun. Adding hot peppers (which are the only free topping) to the equation is a must as it adds a nice kick to your sandwich. Another must is ordering a side of olives; these guys make some of the best olives I've had. Their olives are huge and full of red chilli flakes and big chunks of hot jalapeno peppers making them spicy and AMAZING!  My only complaint is that their bread is a little too soft; having taken my sandwich to go by the time I got home the bread had become soggy.   Price-wise this place is not cheap by Scarborough standards. A plain veal sandwich will run you about $7, add cheese for $1 other toppings will be 50-75 cents, if you like yours with toppings you are looking at around a $10 dollar sandwich. This location is fairly new and quite modern looking inside, definitely an upscale look for a fast food type establishment. I love that they have a small bar near the cash where you can sit, enjoy your sandwich and have a beer; there is plenty of table seating also. Overall a great option for some Italian eats in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Big line up for a weekday lunch outing. Had to wait 30min to get my sandwich and boy it was good!  I got the veal parm, added the cheese and onions. It was massive and you could almost share it with someone. I would recommend getting a drink as it is a lot of breaded veal going through your food pipe. The tomato sauce.. wow!  Would go again for sure!"}
{"text":"This review isn't targeted at any specific location but California Sandwiches in general. This was my second time here eating the sausage w/ onions and provolone. I asked for extra sauce because I'd read some reviews that said the sandwiches were dry and wished to avoid that. However, when I saw the lady dump sauce onto it, I instantly realized that it was a mistake. I knew the buns were gonna be drenched in sauce and as a result get soggy.   I unwrapped the sandwich with excitement and to my disappointment the first bite tasted like a hot sandwich. You're probably wondering what the big deal is since the place is known to serve hot sandwiches. The fact is that it tasted like hot cardboard drenched in a tasteless tomato sauce. The tomato sauce had no seasoning at all and in my opinion, it even lacked salt. The sausage tasted like nothing as well. I went in with a lot of expectations and I think my rich palette is somewhat to be blamed for it but I have eaten better food, I know good food. I left almost half of my sandwich after gulping down the rest with pop. If you're reading this and you are considering giving it a try and have somewhat of a rich palette, don't try this. You will be disappointed. I give it 2 stars for the service and courteous staff."}
{"text":"Best veal sandwich around. Only item I've ever had there and it's amazing.   If you're looking for a steak sandwich I recommend nearby San Francesco's, but the veal is unbelievable!  Have a variety of ingredients available to add to the sandwich. I go with hot peppers and onions. Delicious."}
{"text":"It is an awesome sandwich, but it is a little pricey...if your Italian or just a meat lover you'll positively like the food, fresh, made to order sandwiches with multiple toppings, i use to go to the sheppard location but very similar...."}
{"text":"This is kind of the opposite of what I think of when I think of a \"California Sandwich\"... maybe turkey & avocado on organic whole wheat?  Not here!  This place is fried goodness on a fresh bun!  YUM  I have eaten the veal & chicken sandwiches.  Both are fried cutlets drenched in yummy sauce.  Make sure to get cheese on them.  Also beware, the spicy is very hot.  They are so big, you don't need any sides."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why this place is such a \"thing\". Are veal sandwiches thought to be a quintessential California dish in Canada? (They're not, FYI.) I found the sandwich to be a hot mess, tasty enough, I suppose, but nothing I'd go back for. Lots of calories that I immediately regretted."}
{"text":"Don't think I'm crazy....but I would have to recommend the Chicken sandwich over the veal one!! I personally find that the chicken is more tender, making it a hell of a lot easier to take a bite out of this ginormous thing! I'd also say that putting onions on it for an additional charge is well worth it."}
{"text":"Cool, casual decor. Great Italian veal and eggplant parm sandwiches. During lunch also serve a full line of freshly made pastas. Personally, I enjoy the pasta better than the sandwiches and wish they offered it during dinner time.  For dessert try their gelato, really yummy.   Some tips: - Cash only - no service (fast food style, but better quality than typical fast food) - more expensive than similar style restaurants - always busy, expect to stand in line to order"}
{"text":"LOVE California Sandwiches...esp. the Veal....hello...however not as good as my nonnas..lols  Love the olives as well.  I must say the Veal Sandwhiches are consistantly good.  Parking is a nitemare....and its a overpriced...but it still doesnt stop me from having lunch here at least once a week.. :P"}
{"text":"I don't get the hate for this place.  Meatball sandwich was delicious! It was huge, messy and tasty on a soft kaiser bun.  Perfect remedy for a long day.However, 1 star off for charging for toppings.  Don't like that, but I loved the juicy meatball sandwich here.  Would visit again."}
{"text":"Food rant ...  I used UberEATS to order from California Sandwiches being a mini chicken sandwich and onion rings. Keep in mind the mini sandwich isn't too far off in size from the large one and comes on a round bun. Anyways, I receive my order and realize they gave me veal instead of chicken. I like veal but not on sandwiches. On top of it, they give me half a sandwich from the large size. What the heck is that? I call California Sandwiches because it was obviously a mistake on their end. I re-checked my order several times to ensure I in fact did order chicken, which I did. I call and was speaking to someone who sounded half dead and just wasn't having any of it. She asks for my order number/phone number and insists she can't find my order in their system. What do you mean you can't find my order? I just placed it from that specific location, received my order with my name on it .. but yet I apparently never placed an order? ok. She tells me to contact UberEATS, mind you UberEATS stops taking orders at 10 and at this point it was 9:40. I email UberEATS and figure I'd call California back because I wanted it resolved asap. I was speaking with a much nicer, alive sounding person who was very helpful this time. She quickly found my order, put me on hold to contact UberEATS herself (thank you, because how the frik is an email going to resolve anything in such a short time span?) comes back and says I should be expecting a call from them very shortly. I got the call 20 seconds later and explained my story to the UberEATS representative and for whatever reason, she was giving me attitude as if she couldn't understand what my concern was. My order was in turn refunded and she asked me if I wanted my meal remade correctly. I said no, why would I want half a sandwich again, I don't even care if it's chicken, I don't want half of another sandwich. She was still confused and said listen, what if you went to McDonalds, order a Big Mac and have it come on Wonder bread toast? No point in me re-ordering something that's not what it was supposed to be. Man, what a day and all I wanted to do was enjoy a yummy sandwich and these people pissed me off to the point of I'm not even hungry anymore. They should be updating the menu items specifying they're sold out of certain things. To me it's false advertising to be given a makeup for what I ordered without being aware of it to begin with."}
{"text":"Holy Moly look at the size of this thing! I yelled to my hubby. Portions here are very large, we split a veal sandwich with an order of sweet potato fries. I couldn't hold the sandwich in one hand, good thing they cut it in half. They were generous with the sauce but I'm not a fan of sour tomato sauce, either cook it longer or add a little bit of sugar to cut the acidity. The hot peppers aren't sliced they're mashed and looked like guacamole. I spread some pepper paste over the sandwich and it tasted a little better. I'm sure I could have doctored it up by adding more toppings but then I would have to shell out more money. A good veal sandwich doesn't need more toppings to make it taste better. The sweet potato fries were decent. Comparing it to Primo Veal I couldn't give it any higher rating."}
{"text":"Got lunch at work from the Warden/Eglinton location. It's big, it's messy and it's spectacular.  Nuff' said ;-)."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Get ready for a special treat but make sure you either have a big bib or a lot of napkins!! If you like veal on a bun this is the place to try. You can make your sandwich to order from just veal to veal with sauce and all the toppings you like. The portions are huge so you can either split it into two meals or share with someone or opt to order the smaller size.  I personally think price is high compared to a good burger but it is definitely a good change and treat.  Wait wasn't long as they have a lot of people getting things together to get you going!  I would definitely go back as a good lunch option."}
{"text":"I went in not expecting a CHIC & SIMPLE decor from a Sandwich place.  It had an open kitchen and like Shari M. said, the women do look miserable except for a younger lady but they might be grooming her towards misery eventually. :-(  I stood behind a gentlemen in line and went up to order a Veal Sandwich of course.  I believe I saw that there was a piece of paper labeled CASH ONLY stuck to the debit/credit machine, because I only had $10.00 in my wallet just enough for my $7.75 sandwich.  I kind of heard the lady say my number was 24...  I figured that the gentlemen in front of me will get his order, then for sure I know my sandwich would show up next.  NOPE, 24 came first and in record time right after I sat down and watched the Masters on an HD LCD tv for 1 minute.  I was suspicious how it came out so fast and if my order was actually 24 or not.  It was and although it came out fast, the sandwich was fresh, BIG(see photo) and delicious.  The Breaded Veal was CRISPY, the Medium Spicy Sauce had ZING to it, and the Bread was fluffy (White Wonderbread).  I'm actually not use to such a SOFT bun for a Veal sandwich.  The gentlemen got his CHICKEN Sandwich around 5 minutes after mine while I enjoy the Sandwich watching some golf and looking at a couple Father&Son have Father/Son chats.  Not to leave out a Family of three(Father/Mother/Daughter) and some older couples."}
{"text":"I love breaded veal sandwiches so I was excited to bump into a location on the way home from an outing in Scarbs.  Meh - I've experienced better.  The veal wasn't breaded properly ... the breading slipped right off the meat. Also, service was extremely slow.  Warden/Eg isn't my usual hangout nor do I live anywhere close to this intersection so I won't go out of my way to eat here.  The location on Dufferin is my 'go to' from now on."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of hearing someone I know harp about this place. I was intrigued, but never went... until today.  There's a parking lot on site, which is convenient. With two entrances, I can see the potential 'traffic' that could take place here. Just review what your Driving Instructor taught you so many years ago and you should be good.  From the outside it looks meh. The gross looking homes in this area can be quite misleading. On the inside, it's super clean. The building looks quite new.  On my first trip to the register, I ordered the sweet mini chicken sandwich w cheese and grilled vegetables. Breaded chicken in an Italian bun is effin' delicious. The tomato sauce adds juicy deliciousness to the sandwich. Cheese was provolone and was melted. I'm on a Lifestyle Change Journey so I tried to control myself, but ... I needed more! On my second trip, I got the exact same order, but spicy. It was way too hot for me. I was sweating profusely and the Dining Companions said that my face was getting pretty red. In short, if spicy isn't your thing, stick w the sweet.  It's cafeteria style so once your order is ready, you take your tray and find a place to sit.  Cash only. There's an ATM on site, but it's one of those machines that charges your month's salary and your first child in fees.   I'm not (can't anyway w my Lifestyle Change Journey) going to eat here everyday, but once in a while, California Sandwiches on Dufferin can expect to see my beautiful face. :p  A solid 4 star ~"}
{"text":"First time experience and not disappointed at all.   Food was phenomenal and service was great! Definitely coming back next time I'm in the area. 10/10"}
{"text":"First time being here and only wanted to try it after I heard about it in a class, haha. I went with my boyfriend on the weekend and it was a little busy, but thats kind of expected. We ordered a chicken sandwich with onions, mushrooms and hot peppers and he got the steak and onions with the same toppings, we also got an order of fries, but we sure didn't need it. It came to around $25 for everything, which we thought was a little steep for a sandwich, but when we saw the sheer size of them we were both wide eyed. It's massive !  The amount of meat and toppings is incredibly filling and its delicious. Only downside is if you're driving home, the bread gets soggy and its really messy to eat. I really appreciated the amount of napkins given to us in our bag haha. We will probably be back again to try the other sandwiches :)"}
{"text":"We came in around 6:15 PM before the place gets busy for the dinner crowd. My BF has advised me of how big the sandwiches are, so we have decided to share one sandwich. We tried the Meatball sandwich. We only really have to wait less than 5 mins for our food, and I was very impressed at how BIG the sandwich was! The price is fair for how much you get.   The meatball sandwich was very sloppy, the cheese did not overpower the taste of the meat. The bun is ok size as well, just right. I'm glad I order an extra little pack of tomato sauce, as pouring that over the sandwich just made the sandwich taste better.  I recommend this place, fast service, fair prices, and I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This California Sandwiches is the BEST. Everything is extremely fresh and you know that you are getting the best quality. The restaurant is kept extremely clean and you are sure to get amazing service. My favourite is the eggplant parm with lots of hot peppers or the veal with cheese and hot peppers (less sauce). Be sure to try the eggplant parm....it is to die for, you may never go back to veal."}
{"text":"This place makes me a happy pappy limit yourself to 4 times a year or people will ask if it's boy or girl? The best plan is to order the veal and the meatball sangaweedge with cheese and mush . Take them home eat a 1/2 because that's all you can due to its size and girth ....then let your girlfriend,wife, partner,eat the other half and save the other Sammy for tomorrow and then repeat mmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I grew up on these sandwiches. Absolutely delicious every time. You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches, they are all equally delicious. The eggplant and the chicken are my favorite. A brio and a California sandwich from this location, there isn't much better than that."}
{"text":"I am a hardcore California Sandwiches lover and I found this place horrific. The food is absolutely disgusting. The Claremont location is the best... don't waste a single dollar at this location! You will receive poor service and disgusting food. I've tried this location THREE times and each time my food was cold and my chicken was hard."}
{"text":"Service is quick and dismissive but the sandwiches are fresh as any.    Ordered the veal cutlet and wasn't disappointed as I have ordered it from another location beforehand.    It is what it is you can compare to others but this like variety still in ingredients and toppings."}
{"text":"My parents order from here every so often, and the sandwiches are amazing!  In the past I've tried a veal cutlet and/or a meatball sandwich and both were delicious.  Truly worth the money (under 10$)"}
{"text":"Came for lunch today. This was Plan B. Plan A was Granite Bistro, but parking there costs money. Was quite surprised to see how many people were lining up. That's a good sign though, I think. A lot of people order for takeout, so there is table space at lunch on weekdays. The difference between takeout and eat in is that if you order takeout, you get your food in a paper bag. If not, you get a wrapped sandwich directly into your hands. It's hot. Be careful. Service was not bad, although it's awkward standing in front of the drink fridges waiting for your food.   Each sandwich is under $10 before tax, but once you start adding things on, you're over $10 for sure. I had the eggplant sandwich with mushrooms and sauteed onions. The sandwich, sans mushrooms and eggplants, was $7.30. The mushrooms were $0.99 and the onions were $0.44. These sandwiches are  quite messy. Occupational hazard of having tomato sauce in sandwiches. Thankfully, they do give you a wad of serviettes. Actually, perhaps this mess was just my sandwich. My friend Alex got the chicken sandwich and he said his was on the dry side. Maybe mine was messier cuz of the mushrooms. The mushrooms were a good addition. For $1.00, there were a lot of mushrooms. They cut my sandwich in half and I could see a good layer of them in there. I'd order that addition again. I wouldn't get the onions again though. I was thinking caramelized onions. These were just cooked. They had raw onion crunch, but didn't taste like raw onions. I dislike that texture. There were at least two layers of breaded eggplant in my sandwich. I wish I could taste more eggplant and less breading though. There was a lot of breading. The sandwich also got progressively soggier and messier to eat as time passed. Forks are your friend.  These sandwiches are quite large. I play the piano and can stretch over an octave. Loosely stretching my hand, the sandwich is about the diameter of my hand. I ended up finishing half of my sandwich and taking the other half home. Alex did finish all of his, so it isn't impossible. LOL.  It's not a bad sandwich. I wouldn't mind trying another sandwich some time. Next time though, I'm not going to wear white."}
{"text":"Okay where do I start here... size matters? Right off the bat, I'm not a big \"bread person\" but I do enjoy a well constructed sandwich. I also hate when filling just spills out of a bun. When food gets too messy to enjoy it makes me actually enraged. That being said, California Sandwiches really held its own here. The concept is simple: choose your meat, decide on your toppings and then if you want a \"snack\" or \"regular\" size. I opted for the crispy chicken with cheese and hot peppers snack size.  Pro tip: ask for the sauce on the side. You'll thank me later. I definitely did when advised by my friends. Sauce on the side will allow you to determine the sandwich to marinara sauce ratio. I got my sandwich (10 minutes made fresh to order) and this thing was steaming hot and big in my opinion. Remember I got the snack size. My dining friends got the regular and it could easily have feed 2 people. The chicken was very thin and breaded well with at least 3 large pieces in the sandwich. The kaiser but wasn't too hard but it was sturdy enough to house the fillings. Finally the marinara wasn't mind blowing but it was great for dipping.   I left full and satisfied but not stuffed. Cost wise, it's decent. You pay per topping so it's up to you about how crazy you want to go. For your first time I suggest letting the sandwich speak for itself."}
{"text":"I really enjoy a veal sandwich that's been cooked properly.  Properly cooked means the veal is tender, not tough.   One must pan fry it rather than bake it, which means the breaded cutlet crisps up well.  Veal is a mild meat, but you can taste quality.  Gamey veal is old veal.  My ideal veal sandwich has hot peppers and maybe some sauce.  California Sandwiches chain does a great job of doing veal sandwiches how I like them.  The menu is limited, but they know what they are doing.  I have yet to have a tough sandwich.  The veal is not too old and tastes mild, not too beefy.  It comes hot or not and you can add extras like cheese, mushrooms or onions.  My biggest problem with the Claremont location is that it can get brutally busy during peak times.  You can usually park within a block, but the the lines when you arrive during lunchtime can be long.  If you are going to do takeout during busy times like lunch, it's much quicker experience to call a head.  You will be assigned a number and that allows you to skip part of the line when you arrive for your pickup.."}
{"text":"Amazing! A sandwich as big as your head, delicious and fun to eat. Get extra napkins and a friend to help finish if you run out of room! Warning to the inexperienced- the hot is HOT! Thanks CS. See you again soon!"}
{"text":"My favourite Italian Sandwiches! The breaded eggplant is incredible, and huge portions too! Make sure you get the marinated olives as well. And the people who work here are very nice and friendly also. If you want a tasty and hefty sandwich to grab for takeout, this is your place!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me this long to finally try a California Sandwiches veal sandwich. Admittedly I used to just get my veal sandwich fix at the one place in the St Lawrence Market, but since I don't work in that anymore I've been going through withdrawal and noticed this place when visiting the neighbouring Five Guys Burgers.  In anticipation of this meal, I scoured the California Sandwiches website to create my plan of attack for lunch. Upon actually executing on that plan and arriving to the restaurant itself, I happily realized that the prices for food were all lower than the website advertised price by around a dollar, which is \"A-OK\" right off the bat. And when you get the massive veal sandwich back in your hands, you become completely at ease with the fact you just dropped over $10 on a sandwich without any sides or a drink, and I knew that \"Yay! I'm a fan\".  One thing to also mention was that it was a Friday lunch when I went, and all the tables were full for dine in, and a line-up at least 12 people deep were waiting to place their order. That said, they are a pretty smooth moving operation and I was able to wait in line, order, and receive my food within around 15 minutes which left ample time to commute back to the office since take-out was the only option due to the lack of available tables in the restaurant. So take that into account if you're planning on going for lunch. However if you do get a table, there is the option of having a drink with it as they are licensed and do carry a small selection of beers, wine, and Sambucca. Aside from that, the location is pretty new so everything is clean and there is plenty of parking (which seems relevant since I'd imagine few people spend much time in this area without a car).  Now, lets get down the sandwich... I had the Veal sandwich, although also tried a piece of the Chicken sandwich. Both were fantastic but the veal was perfection, with thinly cut tender pieces of baby cow with just enough breading and big enough pieces to eclipse the edges of the bun. Oh man I'm getting a craving now just thinking about it. The perk to the chicken sandwich was it did have thicker cuts of meat within the breading, but to me didn't stand out with the same level of impressiveness that the veal did.  All in all, I now understand why the California Sandwiches name has such reputability in the veal world, and I'm sure I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"90's hip hop act the Alkaholiks once said, \"You are now rocking with the best\". And when it comes to veal sandwiches, California could rep that chorus all day long.  I could complain about they fact they nickle and dime (errr, loonie and toonie) with add-on prices for toppings, but even after the add ons, we're talking about one fantastic and filling sandwich. No side dish required, as one of these sandwiches is a meal in itself.  California Sandwiches sets the bar for veal in Toronto, and this trip reminded me why I used to eat these things way too often, while also redeeming the mediocre experience I had at their Yonge St location."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it, like I did every other California Sandwiches location Ive visited. One first impressions, this new location is big and spacious and clean. Unfortunately the cleanliness of this location could not make up for my overall sandwich disappointment.  One giant mistep was when I ordered my veal sandwich with medium spice, adding cheese, sweet peppers, and jalapeno. I noticed the baseball hat wearing guy didnt punch in the jalapenos on the til so asked and he said something along the lines of \"they come on it standard\". I thought that was weird, but let it go until my to go bag was handed to me which he read off the ingredients, no mention of jalapenos. I asked again, if there were jalapenos on it and he confirmed there would be. Transition to 7 minutes later when I walked my sandwich home to open it up and find sure enough, no jalapenos. I mean this was frustrating (paying just under $11 for a single sandwich and they screw it up), but then even with the jalapenos the sandwich would have been lacking the normal WOW factor that their veal sandwiches normally have. I'm not sure if it was the amount of veal or the breading seemed different, something just felt lacking.  I'll probably give them another shot (I mean this is the first time in probably a good 10 collective California Sandwich experiences that I've left un-wowed), but hopefully they fix up as this locations experience issues."}
{"text":"YES. Being from out of town, this place is a must for when we head up to Toronto. We usually bring back more sandwiches for family back home (sauce on the side!)"}
{"text":"I returned another time and it was still decent but not as fresh as my last visit. Bun was a bit stale and the veal was cooked earlier in the day so not as hot and crisp as it should be. I did get a eggplant slice this time which they cooked fresh and was a nice addition.   With any veal sandwich place the key is to go when they are turning over a lot customers and are cooking everything fresh to order."}
{"text":"Very tough veal, impossible to break off. Bad service, seems like they need more help and less old ladies."}
{"text":"One of the best veal sandwiches around. I ran into rap artist DRAKE in line in front of me at this location."}
{"text":"My usual is veal hot with onions. Been coming here since I was born. My family has been coming here since they opened. The original location is the best location out of all the California Sandwiches."}
{"text":"California sandwiches are awesome! Delicious breaded veal smothered in tomatoe sauce with provolone cheese and jalapenos is where it's at! It's in a great location to grab a quick bite while shopping in heartland. They even have a quick pay kiosk so you don't have to wait in line to order.  You definitley get your money's worth here with a big sandwich to make you full."}
{"text":"California Sandwiches is my favorite Italian sandwich place ever! I was pleasantly surprised that thehe authenticity is exactly as the original location on Clairmont. Onky one disappointment, we ordered a medium but it could have been hotter. Otherwise EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"I visited this place when it first opened up a few years ago and wasn't entirely impressed. Here is the but you were waiting for.  The past two times I went there the veal on a bun was magical.  Better than the mothership in many ways."}
{"text":"Simply the best Veal in Toronto. Have not ate at the other locations but this one is  unreal."}
{"text":"WOW! This is 100% a MUST-TRY in the city of Toronto.  Truly is an authentic veal sandwich at its finest. Staff was super friendly, and the price was well worth every penny for the size of the sandwich. You really cannot find quality like this anywhere else these days.  Mouth watering veal....fresh Italian kaiser.....homestyle tomato sauce....sautéed mushrooms.....oozing with provolone cheese.   It was like a little piece of heaven....wrapped up nicely in a bun!"}
{"text":"GREAT SANDWICH!! This really is as authentic an Italian veal sandwich as it gets.  Super fresh, great value and staff was friendly and helpful.  If you haven't tried one yet, you really are missing out. Definitely a Toronto favourite!"}
{"text":"Basic. Soup sandwich. No flavour. I'm still trying to figure out what all the hoopla is about"}
{"text":"I kept hearing about California Sandwiches for a long time. I never had the chance to try them out because i've always had my go to places for veal, chicken & meatball sandwiches. All i ever heard wass \"best sandwich you'll ever have\". I tried not to have any expectations, but gotta admit, i sort of did based on all the hype. We were in the area shopping and wanted to grab some lunch with the kidlets, so we stopped in to check out the menu etc.  Ordering was easy, but would've been better if the cashier had explained that there were 2 different sandwich sizes. Especially since my hubby ordered 2 for himself, not knowing how huge they actually were (we took 1 home). I later noticed in small letters at the bottom of the menu that mini sandwiches were an option. Still would've been nice if they explained that after we mentioned it was our first visit and we asked what they would recommend.  I ordered my veal sandwich with: sauteed onions, cheese & mushrooms - onions were not cooked to carmelization and had a bit of snap to them. Normally i don't mind that, but they didn't even taste sauteed. Barely noticed the cheese, way too many mushrooms. It was drenched in so much sauce that after 2 bites, the top of my sandwich bun disappeared. Oh yeah that and the fact that someone there has no clue as to how to slice a bun in half. They left the top thin and the bottom so thick! I only ended up eating half of my sandwich there because it was just going all over the place and way too messy. Lost my appetite after trying to fight with one half of my lunch.  My hubby ordered a steak sandwich. He asked what it came with. One thing they failed to tell him was that it came with tomato sauce - correction - drenched in sauce! He enjoyed it, but would've preferred the sauce on the side or no sauce at all. Or that if they His 2nd sandwich was a chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomato & mayo - that one was the winner for him. He enjoyed it at dinner.  The portion of meat in each sandwich was great. The experience would've been much better if:  1 - the sauce had some flavour to it 2 - the bun was evenly sliced  3 - the breading of the veal or the veal was seasoned better 4 - the onions were cooked through a bit more  Thankfully our kids ate somewhere else before we went in. The only thing we ordered for them was fries & onion rings to share. Not a fan of crispy fries, so i stopped at just 1. Good for kids only if they are a fan of veal & chicken parmasean, sausage & meatball sandwiches.  I noticed that a few people commented on the mushrooms being canned etc. I believe they are hydrated mushrooms as fresh would leave a risk of containing bacteria if not stored properly etc. Nevertheless, they tasted good.   I will consider trying another location and giving them another chance. I was just disappointed at this location because they had a high number of staff in the kitchen that day and were not able to deliver on the flavour & experience for me and it wasn't even busy when we were there."}
{"text":"Ooooh, this brings back memories. Been eating California (veal) Sandwiches for yeaaaaaars. Love, love, loooove 'em! I'd like to use this review to affirm to y'all that these sandwiches are, indeed, for the win. Yes, that is all.   (Call to order take-out. That way you avoid the line-ups and get straight to the good stuff!)"}
{"text":"Always gunned for their veal sandwiches. BUT! Recently, thanks to Yelp, got their tiramisu. It's so lovely! Comes in a cute mason jar, as well. Delightfully sweet - great choice for those who don't like super sweet desserts."}
{"text":"We used to come quite often but stopped over a year ago.  Eggplant was underdone 3 visits in a row.  So hard it was difficult to bite through.  Terrible!  Chicken is always tough too.  Veal and meatball are the only two that are consistently ok.  Not worth the money for just \"ok\".  Joes is a better place in the plaza and the sushi place is alway awesome too."}
{"text":"Haven't gone in a while and I had a craving for a veal sandwich. With taxes, a veal sandwich with onions is now over $10. That to me is quite expensive for what you get. Probably explains why the place was next to empty on a Friday at 6 pm. Also the bun has changed, smaller and probably sourced from different bakery."}
{"text":"This place is great. Quick, clean and delicious. It even has good vegetarian options for my mum."}
{"text":"Great food for the price even bettter taste   But I'm rating this 3/5 because this location has a whole lotta bruta no bella"}
{"text":"I was treated like such shit at this place that I will never return. The sandwiches are not good enough to be treated poorly by an underfed idiot for no reason. My co-worker friend and I decided to go pick up sandwiches there last Fall and called ahead with our order. I had been to the store many times before and witnessed them taking phone orders, and people picking up called-in orders, so thought it was a standard process. We were given a number and told it would take approximately 30 minutes.  We arrived at the packed location and expected to wait a bit but then... overheard the counter-woman give the person ordering a number lower than the one she had given us on the phone. That is to say, at 12:10 when I called, she gave me number 66 and at 12:25 when we arrived, told the person ordering at the counter they had number 52.  This didn't make sense so my friend tried to ask the person behind the counter to explain why people 15 minutes later were getting lower numbers than us and they were still serving number 30. She asked very politely, wondering if maybe we had written down the number wrong? The response was so full of anger and nonsense: the woman said something along the lines of \"the number is what you get\" and then offered to cancel our order. My friend said not to cancel  it, that she didn't understand the policy and wanted to understand it. The employee behind the counter continued to speak angrily at us and was unable to explain the policy, I came to the conclusion that either she had just made up the policy at the drop of the hat or was a complete moron. Either way she was a disgusting rude human being and we quickly decided to leave. As we were leaving, I said in a very calm voice. \"You can cancel #66\"  which was received with much yelling from the counterperson (and, consistently  for her, none of it made any sense). I laughed and left the place and plan to never return. We went down the street to San Francisco's where we were treated respectfully and served very tasty sandwiches very quickly. I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Had the veal sandwich. Great price for such a huge sandwich. Didn't realize how big it was until they handed it to me and I could feel the weight. Had to eat in two servings. There were a few people ordering but still didn't have to wait long.  As for taste I'm not a big veal fan but could tell this was great quality. Next time I'll try the chicken.  One tip is this place is cash only."}
{"text":"Absolutely love California sandwiches. Was excited to try a different location.   Ordered  the veal w/ cheese and mild sauce... Was not as saucy as the other location. The sauce is the best part in my opinion. As well as French fries  Overall sandwich could have been better. Fries were amazing.   Everyone else is raving about the staff being so nice there really wasn't anything spectacular. The lady at the counter was very short and blunt with us.  However both my significant other and I got sick after eating at this location. So because of that reason I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Glad they have a location near work.  Just like the other locations they make sure the sandwich is nice and messy.  Ask for HOT because medium isn't as hot as it was."}
{"text":"A very good sandwich. Veal with all the works, is messy but oh so good. Old school charm but it's about the food. Going to go back again."}
{"text":"Really good for when you're in the mood for something hearty. Veal and chicken sandwhiches are my fav, with cheese and hot peppers. They're usually very busy but fast and consistent. I've been to other Cali sandwhiches and they weren't as good as this location. There's lots of seating and a hot table with lots of goodies like lasagna, pasta, stuffed peppers and salads."}
{"text":"I feel like no veal sandwich will be able to beat a California sandwich(except for the original location). There's no going wrong with this joint. The cons of this location are: extremely busy during lunch hours and the parking is just a mess during peak hours. The pros: the underrated hot table, the veal of course, beer available, spacious and the olives"}
{"text":"Honestly, it was a very mediocre chicken sandwich. Not enough sauce, not enough jalapenos - weak. Used to get really good ones from cali sandwich outside of the city but this was disappointing. Cash only too."}
{"text":"It's Cali Sandwiches so you know it's fantastic.   This location is huge, clean, very nice with a big area for sitting, cold beer ready to down with your delicious breaded veal sandwich.... just good times all around.  I like mine spicy with sweet peppers and mushrooms but I can't imagine a combo that doesn't kick ass here.   Service is fast and efficient. I don't believe they have interac though, I didn't see a machine and ended up paying with cash, but I didn't ask either so beware.  Also getting in and out of the place via car can be a pain in the ass.   Will be back here. Often."}
{"text":"First the Good -  NONE The Bad - Typical Crap Toronto Service.  Typical Toronto Quality Items ,Typical Toronto Class!!! No greeting or pleasantries, after all we are only the customers.....The Girl called out our order, while gossiping and swearing to co workers , she had her back too us and shoved our tray at us with out even tirning to face us, as she would have to stop swearing!!!! I hope this is not the owners daughter. Any how Toronto-ians seem to love this  pseudo Italian fair... it sloppy gooey  and not at all authentic.  This is an  EXCEPTIONALLY UNPLEASANT ATMOSPHERE  and customer experience.  Unfortunaly too many place in the GTA operate on this particular model. Toronto despite trumpeting itself as the Cultural Center of the Universe , and a New York  want to be , another GTA business again falls flat on customer service. Boycott crap service."}
{"text":"One of the more sketchy locations I've been to at this end of Mississauga but hey with big portions how could someone complain. I glad they don't have one in Oakville otherwise I'd be an extra 30 lbs heavier! The Veal is a classic every needs to try that drenched in tomato sauce or if you're feeling extra hungry go for the meal ball with cheese and hot peppers! So tasty but you'll need a nap after.  Be warned, this location only takes cash."}
{"text":"This is the original and it's the best! A little expensive for what you get and they've sure figured out how to make the veal go a long way by hammering so thin you can see through it. But the amazing sauce makes this sandwich as wonderful mess that you just have to have."}
{"text":"Another good location in the California Sandwiches chain. But boy things have gotten expensive over the years. Two veal sandwiches, each with a few toppings, and a couple of drinks is over $30.  It seems there are some new toppings and now even a new sandwich, pork schnitzel. Might be worth a try if I can ever bring myself to NOT order a veal! :)"}
{"text":"Alas how the mighty have fallen. $27 for two sandwiches and a pizza slice. Sandwiches over cooked, rubbery, and bland. Pizza slice had a hair cooked into it. From a legendary place to this in 50 years"}
{"text":"I went there about 3pm for an late lunch! Get the chicken with cheese & mushrooms, Tastes like heaven with lots of homemade tomato sauce."}
{"text":"This location is absolutely fantastic. Out of my way, but well worth the drive.  Ordered a regular veal sandwich and was pleasantly surprised at how much veal was put on the sandwich. There was THREE large pieces of veal!!!!! Absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Decided to give this location another try.  I just wanted to convey my disappointment with your Richmond Hill location.  I have been to at least four other locations in the greater Toronto area and each one has been spectacular.  The Richmond Hill location is quite disappointing. It provides half of the amount of product than the other locations.  I just purchased a veal sandwich this afternoon from the Richmond Hill location and was given a medium size piece of Veal and another half that was cut from a medium size piece. if I compare the amount of veal given at the Richmond Hill store to your other locations it would've been atleast double the amount.  The veal was also extremely salty.  Very disappointed.   I should have trusted my initial judgement when I walked into the store to find very few customers at the height of lunchtime. In the other locations at noon or just after noon, there would be a lineup of at least five customers purchasing, and another five waiting for their sandwiches to be made.  I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Will definitely be back to this location.  Veal was plentiful on the MINI veal sandwich."}
{"text":"I went to the Warden and eglinton location, I didn't like the sandwich at all, for me it looks like food on top of food, it doesn't have any special flavor that make me wish to come back. Even though the portions are huge, the price is too high, and you need to pay extra to add cheese, onions, etc."}
{"text":"Had the veal sandwich with cheese and mushrooms. Ordered the spicy version. It was all right. I was expecting more zing to it but it was somewhat bland. Huge portion though! Couldn't finish it in one go. Brought it home and it tasted better the next day. Really want to try their meatball sandwich."}
{"text":"Foodies out there if you have not tried a veal sandwich from California sandwiches your missing out , this review is a bit on the biased side because hot veal with cheese sandwich has to be one of my favorite meals.  This place has great service and only reason I am giving it a 4 star is because I have eaten here many times and depends on who is cooking the veal it can be either super tender and not over cooked or over cooked and very rubbery...but overall highly recommended best sandwich in mississauga , try there olives also really nice, I am a regular at least once every two weeks that's how much I love my Italian veal sandwich."}
{"text":"** 3.5 Stars **  I don't know if I had overly high expectations for this place from what people - and Yelpers - have been telling me but I didn't find anything to die-for at California Sandwiches.  Yes their sandwiches are large (mostly the HUGE buns) but it gets really expensive ($7 for veal sandwich and you HAVE to add mushroom and cheese which is $1-something each) comes out to $10.50 - $11 JUST for the sandwich. I'm a rather small guy and I ended up nearly eating the whole thing (okay fine I left TWO bites but only because I knew I'd be too lazy to make lunch the next day). And yeah it was a good sandwich but I can't justify paying that much for a sandwich similar to ones I've made for myself many times over.  I was kind of surprised to find this place hidden within a residential neighborhood but it really is a homey place and the staff are friendly and seem to know all the regulars and their orders!  Side note: I'd really like to know why the U.S. Secret Service gave them a certificate of appreciation.... hmmm"}
{"text":"This place rocks.    People are reviewing it like they paid 50$ for a prime rim triple A Alberta veal sandwich.  For 8$ you get a pound of tender veal meat in a marinara sauce on an italian loaf.  How can you go wrong.   Get drunk, get muchies, go to California Sandwhiches."}
{"text":"Been almost 20 years since last visit, I miss the dingy old interior. A veal, chicken favourite. Tried the steak, it's very greasy, also excellent taste. Great staple to the area."}
{"text":"The chicken is pretty decent, large sandwich.  Not the best veal. The original location is the best. Not cheap."}
{"text":"I love their Eggplant sandwiches!  Yum, and their Veal Sandwiches are amazing too.  The great thing is that the sandwiches are massive, so I have half, and save the rest for later...it's like having 2 for 1!  My bf likes the chicken sandwiches.  They take cash only.  and I think they've done a good job of having great consistently at every location."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a weekend stopover before or after shopping.  The regular sauce they used is freshly made and tastes like grandma's recipe. Despite of being a meat lover I am,  trying a couple of their vegetarian options on the menu satisfied my palate.  Oh and their portions are HUGE !!!  Go try it next time."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong.  All the haters do not know what they are talking about.   They are just Idiots that need to be slapped in the neck with my kosher kielbasa.  The veal is the best your ever going to get.  Chicken is great too.  The rice balls are amazing.  Meatballs are great.   All you haters, go choke on a veal sandwich from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Agreed This is the worst California's I have ever been to The staff is rude and does not have any idea what customer service is.  It's almost like you are inconveniencing them by ordering food Actually pulled up to the door one time at 10 minutes to 9.  Suppose to be open until 9.  Before I could get out of the car the staff ran to the door and locked it After many months I decided to give them another chance since no one can beat California's veal  Disappointed again Veal was salty and pretty well had no sauce on either of our sandwiches.  This store is doing no favours for the chain  On the other hands, Joe's in the same plaza   Goes above and beyond when it comes to customer service and great food.  Definitely good bang for your buck.  I will never return to this California's again.  They may have turned me off California's completely"}
{"text":"Uhhhhh yes please. I finally made it to this amazing place - can't believe I've been passing it by this whole time!?!?!?!!?!?!? They have veal. Hello....VEAL, thin, juicy, hot, crispy (drooool....) veal. And other stuff but who cares.  I had a veal sammich with cheese and mushrooms. You can add other stuff like hot peppers, roasted peppers, onions, etc. I got mine a liiiiiittle bit spicy - BE WARNED this stuff is ruthless!!!!! Burn your mouth and then some.  The bun was perfection...sheer perfection. It was the softest, fluffiest bun I have ever had the pleasure of attaching my mouth to. The veal was so thin and done just right, not dry and not too....wet?  I WILL COME BACK EVERY DAY ALL DAY!!!! as long as i'm in RH....   xoxo  PS thank U, Kris U, for the ahmaaazing recommendation. Bro sure knows his veal!"}
{"text":"amazing food good chefs but terrible cashier service. I ordered and I wasn't even given a receipt , I had to remember a number for 5 minutes and I told the staff and she pretty much said I was stupid. Go to the one on warden much better service!!! Not to mention it's so packed everyday everyone has to squish together to get their order."}
{"text":"on a dreary day in the depths of dorkdale mall, someone whose legs ached like yours, who had cuts on their fingers and germs galore from opening up the back of stinky watches that needed battery changes, who knew a good SANGWICH when they tasted one, would utter the words that would instantly form gobs of spittle at the corners of your stupid grin, and say,  \"let's get CALIFORNIA SANDWICHES\".  which meant only one thing for everyone.  a nice piping sloshed (sometimes a little too thickly) with tomato sauce veal sandwich on a nice fluffy italian bun.  with some cheese if you liked.  and smothered with onions if you were smart.  and peppers if you were adventurous.  and if you really knew what was good for the development and education of your palate, you would spend the extra bucks and try to hog a little tub of their AWESOME and spicy green olives.  you could have cut off your fingers, paralyzed your legs, and be dipped in a vat of cooties and nothing could have ruined your day after you wolfed that down."}
{"text":"I too am disappointed by the quantity and quality of  the food at this location. I've tried twice and won't go back. I have no problems with the many other locations."}
{"text":"California on Dufferin is still one of the best Italian sandwiches in the city. Cutlets are crispy, but not too chewy. Saucy, but not soaking. Spicy, but not overwhelming. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The newest addition to the Cali Sandwich family in Toronto is not to be missed. Serving up absolutely massive sandwiches, piled high with toppings of your choosing. The veal and chicken cutlet are both classics, although you can't go wrong with any choice. The meat is always cooked to perfection, bun soft, and toppings hot. Veteran Tip: Get the sauce on the side, otherwise she can get a bit soggy. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What a kind of warm food!!! The place is a little hard to find which located at a small road across Dundas street. But absolutely deserved.  It's like a family run restaurant which provides various kind of Italian sandwich. The price is really cheap for such a great portion of sandwich. Veal is their popular one, looks like Schnitzel, fried sliced pork. The crispy texture is best and not greasy. I ordered one mini sized sandwich, but it was not mini at all!! It was normal sized bread with one layer meat. For me, it's enough! Their sauce is made of real tomato. Simple but delicious. TIPS: Order Sauce on side!!!! Thus, you will have one sandwich and one tomato soup :P  I enjoyed my eating style, dipping sandwich into the sauce~ Amazing!! All the staff are very friendly and offer children candy for free to welcome chrismas~"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I only heard about California Sandwiches when one of my favourite bands raved about this place at their concert. \"Why can't there be a California Sandwiches in, oh... California?\" asked the band from California. I had to try a sandwich from this place to see if it was that good.  I ordered the Veal Sandwich with hot peppers, mushrooms and cheese - I was definitely not disappointed! The sandwich was huge and I could not finish the thing in one sitting. You get a lot of sandwich in one order, so don't be put off by the prices.   The location of this restaurant is a bit odd, it's located in the middle of a residential neighbourhood. I'm not sure how Jack's Mannequin found this joint lol. Other than that, I have no complaints.   When I'm in the neighbourhood again, I will definitely try another sandwich from California Sandwiches. :)"}
{"text":"Fresh new place which seems to still be getting organized (but service was prompt and pleasant). Advertising gelato and have the case for it but it's \"coming soon.\"   My friend had the Veal sandwich with sauce on the side. Experienced California Sandwiches customer she is, she said it helps keep the bun from getting too soggy, especially when taking out.  I had the Meatball sandwich.  Oh, yummy!  One GIGANTIC meatball on a round bun with tomato sauce.  Was really good.  Squishy wet bun was OK by me in this case.    Sandwiches are around $7.  Note that a slice of Provolone is $1 extra.  You can also order toppings like mushrooms, also extra.  Olives were available for purchase in deli-style containers and looked delicious.  Tasted an onion ring there for sampling. They were good and I'll consider them in future.  Was surprised that they had beer and wine.  Sadly, can't have it on the lunch hour.  Loved that they offer San Pelligrino Limoncello and Brio Chinotto in addition to the usual pops.  We sat at one of the serviceable table and chair sets.  There's also bar-style seating.  My friend seemed surprised by the seating, so this must be different from other locations.  I didn't count but there seemed to be a reasonable number of them."}
{"text":"Incredible Veal Sandwich!  California Sandwiches is now some big chain but I love the way the place is all set up. Simple menu consisting of Italian style sandwiches, salads, and coffees. Basically, it's set up as a cafe but with much more messier food options.   The veal sandwich was two thin slices of breaded veal drenched in sauce and served on a kaiser roll. It starts out at $7 but only gets higher when you start adding (necessary) toppings like cheese and hot peppers. I got the medium peppers and cheese added to it, which came out to like $10.  The sandwich is HUGE. The veal overlaps across each other and extend outward from the sandwich. You'll get some flaps of breaded veal hanging from the end of the bun. It's fantastic. The veal itself was nice but a little tough and didn't have too much flavor to it. The real flavor comes from &nbsp;the sauce as it was great. The hot peppers and cheese worked very well and complements the sandwich perfectly. The combination of them all are a must have. If you can't do the peppers, do NOT order it without cheese. When that cheese melts, you have the perfect sandwich.  The ladies making the sandwich looked tired and overworked, so they seemed a bit grumpy to me. No issue on my part as I've been in their shoes before. This place is bustling with the lunch crowd and they are churning sandwiches in the perfect assembly line. Great food. A bit high in price, but if I'm ever in the area, I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite sandwich places ever. There are a bunch of locations each a tiny bit different (at least the sauce is). They serve italian paninis and small pasta dishes as well. If you haven't had an italian panini from california sandwiches, prepare to be amazed.   It's funny because my girlfriend always teased me about how much meat and filling I put in sandwiches when she would only put something like 2 slices of meat. California sandwiches is not that place. Expect a giant panini filled with a fried cutlet of either veal or chicken (there may be other options but those two are the only ones I ever order). The cutlets dwarf the panini (perfect), are smothered with homemade tomato sauce and topped with you choice of mushrooms, provolone, an onions if you so choose.  A word of caution, depending on the location you go to the severity of the sauce's hotness will varie. I remember getting the sauce \"hot\" at the little Italy location and it was not messing around.   Out of both the veal and the chicken cutlets I actually prefer the chicken. I usually have it topped with cheese and mushrooms ontop and find it perfect. I've had it with sauce on the side but actually prefer how the sauce seeps into the breading making it softer (and messier).  You must visit this place. MUST!  However be warned not to bring your business suit or fancy shirt, your sandwich may end up on it. And dates? Forget about it, unless you want to look like a person mauling their food with sauce up to your wrists.  Or is it just me?  Nah I'm awesome.  Maybe I'll use a knife and fork next time, or is that frowned upon like the chocolate bar?"}
{"text":"Had the meatball and my son had the chicken. Both were tasty and fresh. Ordered the tomato and cheese salad, but it tasted old and the cheese was very soggy. We didnt finish it.  Cash only - very annoying. They do have THEIR OWN ATM machine, but the fees are crazy expensive. They charge you 1.50/transaction and then your bank will charge you another 2.00. I mean c'mon - who doesn't take debit in 2011? Very inconvenient to say the least.  Why is the food Halal??? I am DO NOT eat halal, so I would never assume that you would be serving it since you are not an Islamic restaurant. YOU SHOULD POST A BIG SIGN STATING YOUR MEAT IS HALAL before non muslims eat it! UGH!!!"}
{"text":"Food at this location is well below average as far as other California Sandwiches go. And the icing on the cake is the rude female cashier with ugly spotted tattoos all over her neck. Left me standing at the register over 5 minutes while she's just giggling and gossiping with her coworkers instead of taking my order.   Will definitely not return and don't recommend at all."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, you csn't but love thier sandwiches. It might be a little pricey, but its well worth the money, just one regular sized sandwich will do you just fine. I always leave Cali Sandwiches super-full, and try the chicken cutlet, its delicious, and a must have when you're here!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge a fan of California Sandwiches.  Medium Chicken with Cheese, please.  Cut in half with extra sauce on the side.  I've had this sandwich at almost every location and it has never failed me.  Toronto Roller Derby recently held a training camp at Downsview Park and a number of the skaters stayed at the Montecassino Hotel... Which is located right beside this California Sandwiches location.  We directed a lot of the gals here for food and ALL of them came back with raving reviews!  Some of them even said \"after I leave Toronto, I know I'm going to have cravings for these sandwiches\".  Now that's an awesome sandwich!"}
{"text":"Love their chicken and veal sandwiches.  Every location makes amazing sandwiches... I chose to write my review under the Queensway location because it is the one I frequent the most.  A friend was visiting from Kalamazoo, MI a couple of years ago and I suggested this place for lunch.  She loved it so much; she stopped by on her way out of town to take a couple for the drive home.  She still mentions the sandwiches to this day.  Definitely worth a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hot dang that's a fine sang-wich! I got the veal with mushrooms, sweet peppers and cheese, and everything came together beautifully...I inhaled it in a trance-like state, washing it down with the perfect counterpart...Brio Italian soda. Oh yeah baby, so good.  This was my first sang-wich at California Sang-wiches and it didn't disappoint. But I notice they also have a drool-inducing selection of other deliciousnesses, including gorgeous-looking pastas, risotto, eggplant parmigiana, tiramisu. Can't wait to come back and gorge on those in the very near future.  Gotta say, they have an interesting parking setup. At 2pm on a Friday the restaurant was busy, not rammed...but the little parking lot was still a bit of a cluster. With limited space for cars trying to move in both directions, and cars sitting and waiting for spots to open up, it gets a little hairy in there. And there was an ornery fellow shouting at cars as he tried to direct traffic, getting more frustrated by the minute and even swearing at times. I found the spectacle slightly amusing.  Anyhoo, this cafe has an authentic Italian vibe to it...they have imported Italian treats at the counter and I noticed Italian-looking folks sitting around sipping espresso. All in all, molto bene."}
{"text":"Got the veal with mild peppers and cheese. No frills place with delicious and huge sandwiches."}
{"text":"Its a decent place to have a sandwich. The amount of chicken in it is insane, I love the super spicy ones"}
{"text":"Pretty much the gold standard for veal sandwiches. Delicious."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch since it's close to my work, and easily accessible on a major street... I really like to go here when I'm either hungover or it's super cold outside and I feel like a hot sandwich. It really hits the spot!   Really big sandwiches. I usually get the veal or the chicken, both are really good. I like to add an eggplant slice along with mushrooms, cheese, and jalapeños. It starts off as an $8 sandwich, but after all the add-ons, it comes to ~$12.  Note: Go light or easy on the sauce, otherwise it becomes a mess..   No cups of water available for free, so you have buy a drink and now you are looking at a $15 lunch, which is on the high side, especially for a day-time meal.   I would have given this place 4 stars, but they shitty paper napkins where you have to use a bunch of them, and it never seems like enough. That's my biggest pet peeve when it comes to casual dining."}
{"text":"I have been to a few locations, and I have always ordered the veal parmigiana. It's okay, served hot and fresh, but I prefer going to the Old Bread Mill, Via Panini, if I want a tastier version. I find it to be overpriced here, and they are not very generous when it comes to toppings, that you pay for on top of it. I have only had the veal so I can't speak for anything else they have on the menu, but IMO I think they could improve."}
{"text":"$10 Veal Sandwich with sweet sauce and mushrooms should be renamed 'Stairway to Heaven'. Ethereal"}
{"text":"Get the eggplant sandwich. And the olives. The eggplant sandwich has everything you like about the veal sandwich without the gamey taste and moral guilt. And the olives are the f*cking best. Two sandwiches and a large olives comes to $20.50 and the two of you will be stuffed all day."}
{"text":"Big, tasteless, overpriced veal sandwiches. Maybe because I'm a regular at the sandwich shop at the St Lawrence that sells the same thing. Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Not great and not bad. Food is good lots of options and they have beer so it isn't that bad but to pay that much I rather take the trip down Dufferin to tonys and nick and get the same sandwich for c heapier and they stuff it down there."}
{"text":"Everytime i come here the veal is so tender. The extra topping are always fresh. The sandwich are filled with some much its a work out just to eat it. Im not complaining, it is very tasty."}
{"text":"Solid workday lunch place! Great portions and affordable prices. Their veal sandwich is humongous so I always opt for the mini version. Eat it right away though, or they'll get super gross and soggy. They also sell pretty good tiramisu and are generous with their slices.   Top tip: they're on uber eats! Skip the lines and order from the office :)"}
{"text":"This location just as good as the others but they make the best steak sandwich in the city by far give it a try much bigger portions then some of the other locations as well except Clairmont gives the biggest portions"}
{"text":"Best sandwich on the city hands down always good always big this location gives the biggest portions by far worth the price though it's not cheap if you haven't tried this place you're crazy and missing out"}
{"text":"Sandwich is huge and tasty, but they put too much sauce in it, and becomes hard to hold. Ingredient and sauce dripping everywhere as well... At the end, I decided to put the sandwich on the table, and use fork and knife to eat it~"}
{"text":"After hearing some raves about these sandwiches, I had to check it out.  I had a chicken sandwich (other options include veal, eggplant, steak,etc.)  The sandwich is large, yet heavy on bread and Italian sauce, which can become soggy rather quickly.  They offer soft drinks (Pepsi products) and waters in bottles/cans only.  The restaurant...  * is cash only, yet has an ATM. * has ample seating for families and mid-sized groups"}
{"text":"First time trying this place, after hearing good reviews from coworkers. Gets a little busy during the lunch rush, but the food is prepared pretty quickly. Ordered the Veal Sandwich, with Sauteed Onions, Provolone Cheese and Jalapenos (the toppings other than jalapenos are extra$).  First impression, these sandwiches are HUGE! Got some real weight to them, each sandwich with a couple of veal cutlets. It's covered in sauce and can get a little messy to eat. Recommend to ask for a fork to clean up the scraps afterwards. Taste was good. The cutlet is still a little crispy, and hot off the fryer. Sauce was sweet, tart, but not too overwhelming.  Order a side, and it's definitely enough for two people. Will probably come back some time, and try some of the other toppings."}
{"text":"My boyfriend just ordered me a steak and cheese sandwich- with mushrooms and extra cheese.  The steak was bland and soggy.  Not sure where the extra cheese is. The mushrooms are slimy. So are the onions.  More bread than fillings.  They had no sauce except the hot tomato sauce that came in a container on the side. Disgusting.  What a waste of $12!  A crappy chain like Subway has better sandwiches than this place. Grossss !"}
{"text":"You will think about the sandwich days later. Upping the sand which game to the next level, this particular location is by far the best one I've been to. A good tip is to always ask for the sauce on the side, this way the breading stays crunchy and you won't make a giant mess."}
{"text":"My first time here and I saw the sign from the road and through it I'd give sandwiches a go, after all a California Sandwhich sounds like they would have lots of varieties.  They don't. What if really is is a simple hot lunch Italian sandwiches.  So spending $9.50 for a chicken Sandwhich which I will say the portions were large it's just a bun and breaded chicken. I'm told later that you have to ask for toppings and had no idea as nothing was mentioned to me.  The sauce it bland the chicken thin and the breading heavy.  Would never return."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches that I've found in Toronto so far! The variety is great, the people working here are kind and welcoming. A most try are the spicy olives"}
{"text":"Food is amazing !!! Highly recommend this . And huge portions for the size. The mini is only 5.49 and it is a filler! I used to drive by here and never went buy have been a fan after going there once."}
{"text":"Slow service at 2pm. Long lines. Sloppy to the point where I threw most of it away.   There are better options in the area. Seek them out."}
{"text":"I've heard about this chain for awhile. I finally went and was disappointed when I saw the menu. \"California Sandwiches\" would bring to mind things like veggie toppings, turkey, avocado, lots of greens and multi-grain breads. Not so. There are only breaded meats on the menu (veal, chicken) or meatballs and one option for a sauteed veggie sandwich. So I asked the (unhappy) girl at the counter what's the most popular sandwich - she said \"chicken or veal\" and so I ordered the veal, read that people recommended cheese, so I added cheese (all extra toppings - onions, mushrooms, cheese - cost extra). It's an expensive sandwich, so hopefully it'll be good. It came on a huge white bun, with (albeit tasty) tomato sauce, and the thinnest slices I've ever seen (!) of breaded veal). It didn't look very appetizing but I was willing to try. Yeah, too much bread, not enough meat (the meat tasted cardboardy) - sauce tastes good - but I\"m not paying $10 for white bread and tomato sauce. I haven't been constipated since 2003, but after eating only half (I couldn't stomach the second half), I'm finding myself unable to poop the next day. Trust me, I'm a really good pooper and I eat pretty much everything, so for half a sandwich to bung me up like this, doesn't add to the experience, certainly. The place was clean, the bathrooms were clean. That's the best I can say for this place. I'd rather get a sandwich like this from a little hole in the wall place that will give me more than bread with sauce. Disappointing."}
{"text":"2 weeks later. Different!! GREAT Prime Time ? (Lunch) Regular cook? Who knows?    Best of it's kind!!!!"}
{"text":"Dropped the rating down from 5 stars to 3. On my last two visits, the chicken (on my sandwich) was far too rubbery to enjoy the meal. Totally disappointing and something that seems unique to this location. Staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Best sandwich out there. Today I had the chicken with cheese and hot peppers. This location is very clean and staff are friendly. Only downside is that they don't provide the \"mini\" sandwiches that other locations have...but who am I kidding...a regular size is what I really wanted.... I did find the cheese to be different than elsewhere....which is odd as I thought this was a family run business.  Deeelish........"}
{"text":"I am on a mission for great cheap eats and California veal and eggplant sandwiches are well worth the journey from whereever you are in Toronto.  These monsters closely resemble a veal or eggplant parm sandwich served on a fresh thick roll- I had mine served medium hot and the spice was perfect and I also got cheese and mushrooms on board-  it is large enough for two and be careful they are loaded and ready to explode on first bite.  Hard to find location- next  to Little Portugal and on a network of one way streets. While I was there there was a mix of business people, students and garbagemen all joined through a good cheap eat found only in 'Toronto.  Beware the basement bathroom should be for emergency only.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Just perfect. Perfect soft fresh bun. Perfect succulent veal. The works. What more could I want."}
{"text":"Greatest. Sandwiches. In. Toronto!!! Everything is delicious and portions are huge"}
{"text":"Meh. I have to agree with other reviewers who found this place bland. Yes the portions are huge, but the quality:quantity ratio is extremely low. The bread was soggy and ordinary, the sauce was bland, the eggplant was greasy and over fried, and the \"cheese\" was almost certainly processed. Skip it."}
{"text":"The server was not very friendly, it felt like a inconvenience to serve me and she was very abrupt and no smile zone. To bad as the sandwiches are great:)"}
{"text":"So, so, so good!!! We tried the new York Mills California Sandwiches today and wondered how it would stack up against our favourite local hangout for veal sandwiches. We were amazed! The veal sandwiches were huge, stuffed with veal, mushrooms and hot peppers and they were absolutely, incredibly delicious. The kaiser buns were so fresh it seemed like they had just popped out of the oven. The toppings are reasonably priced and there is no extra charge for the hot peppers -- sweet! The ladies at the counter and in the kitchen are always friendly and the place is clean and modern. I'd post a photo -- except their sandwiches are gone the minute I get my paws on them. Delicious! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by a man who's been going here for nearly 50 years. Let me get this out of the way right off the bat. If you love Italian food you will love this place. It's got that hole in the wall old school vibe so if you're into trendy chic you'll be turned off here. Luckily for the rest of us who come to restaurants for the food 'cause in that category they're fantastic! Plus the staff is very very nice. If you want to find the greatest sandwich in TO trying here is a must. The hot sandwiches is actually spicy and the portions are great. There might be too much sauce for a handful of people but they provide ample tissue with each meal and the flavour makes it worth getting a little messy over period.  Believe the HYPE!"}
{"text":"YUM!  I love California Sandwiches!! I usually get the veal or chicken sandwich with extra hot peppers.  This makes my mouth water from the delicious taste and spiciness of the sandwich.  I've been to a few locations in the GTA and their sandwich is consistently delicious in all the locations."}
{"text":"The staff here must be a little slow.  My sandwich was only cut on the top bun and it looked like who ever made hit pounded it down with their fist on top of it when done making it.  This location is sloppy and a joke compared to any other."}
{"text":"Great place. Been coming for years with a great vegetarian option (eggplant sandwich) or veal parmesan. A hidden thrifty buy is their mini olive portion to accompany ur meal for $2! Always busy at lunch so plan ahead! Staff are always polite and do a great job of dealing with the rushes!"}
{"text":"Take a large crusty bun, a huge chunk of your favorite meat, a whack of sauce and a few minutes of your time and you have a taste of fast food heaven.  The portions are huge so come with an appetite and ask for it to go, even if you are eating in because you will need a bag for the \"other\" half."}
{"text":"Business should be named Soggy Sandwiches. I can't believe there is such a soggy sandwich shop stationed somewhere in California. The bread on my steak sandwich was really soggy and sad. Probably would have been better if I ate just the meat and onions. I ate it right away in the restaurant (not takeout), so it probably becomes soggy instantly after being put together."}
{"text":"Meaty, tasty and very filling no matter what you order!  Extra sauce for dipping in the side makes it truly decadent. Olives are great too."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location but decided to try it today.  I had a veal sandwich which was extremely salty and bland tasting.  My friend order a steak sandwich she said the same thing.. For $11.00 each sandwich, we expected better.....definitely won't go there again."}
{"text":"It's official. I'm a pig.  Can you really blame me? When the food is as good as this, it's almost a sin not to be.   Let me explain, I had a hot veal sandwich and it was really good. With that, I had a Brio to wash it down. The bread was tasty, the veal was cooked perfectly (as expected), and the heat from the hot peppers was alright. I would have preferred it to have been a little hotter, but I'm not complaining.  After I had the veal sandwich I had a grill chicken sandwich (ok, I only ate half of it) and it was good.   This begs the question, can they do no wrong? I'l have to go back, try something else and I'll let you know.  'Nuf said"}
{"text":"Seriously, this is the second California Sandwiches that I've been to (reviewed) this year and they have all been spot on!  The veal sandwich, and why even order anything else, is perfection. I always go for the spicy variation and most of the time ... BOOM! It's like a tasty knock in the mouth.   After coming out of this location, I've realized that I have a new mission in life ... to visit every one of these locations and eat there.  Let's see how far I can get before the year is up.  Wish me luck!"}
{"text":"Not my favourite sandwich place but I can see why people like it.  Their menu isn't very big.  They have a lot of sandwiches to choose from but if you are the one person in the group that wants a salad (like me),  you are stuck with a garden salad.  No other varieties.   So I opted for a meatball sandwich.  The bun was lightly toasted.  Extremely lightly toasted rather.  The meatballs were yummy, but could have been a little more dense as they fell apart really easily.   The tomato sauce made the sandwich tho.  The right amount of spices and flavour.  Would've been great on a pasta! For sandwich lovers, this would be a place i woild recommend.  If you are looking for variety on top of \"California Sandwiches\", this may not be the place for you."}
{"text":"After hearing a lot about how California Sandwiches is awesome, I decided to spend a Friday trying this place as I was coming home to Markham to Waterloo.  I ordered a veal sandwich with mushrooms and cheese. Surprisingly, it costed less than what was advertised on the official website...only costed $10.25 with everything added. My sandwich was ready in about 5 minutes (mind you, it was quite busy when I arrived).  The first thing I noticed was that the sandwich was HUGE! I guess they don't call it California for nothing, since everything in America seems to come in large portions. It was so big I didn't even finish it at the end. I found the veal to be quite good, but there was just too much tomato sauce for my liking. The bread also felt a little soggy, but also huge at the same time...which might have contributed to why the sandwich looked so big.  Overall the sandwich was good, and the quantity received does make the price of $10.25 somewhat worthwhile."}
{"text":"People have been raving to me about this joint for a while now, so I finally decided to check it out today.  Disappointing. I got the basic vegetarian sandwich for $4.50. When I opened it up, it was a sloppy mess. I can't really comment on the bread since it was drenched in sauce, which was too salty for me to pick out any other flavour. I couldn't bring myself to finish more than half of it, and my hands were a red, sticky mess after this ordeal. Definitely didn't live up to its hype at all.  Two stars because the place is clean and has a welcoming diner feel inside, and they were playing some sweet oldies."}
{"text":"This was the bomb. I first tried one of these sandwiches 6 years ago while on holiday in Can. It not this store - I'd dreamed about a repeat visit since. Walked in and ordered the veal with mushrooms and cheese and medium sauce. The staff released that I was going to feed it to my three yr old and suggested the sauce was too hot. They invited me to order something but I knew he couldn't eat such a giant sandwich. Mins later they come over with a free roll dipped in sauce and cheese as well a meatball on a plate. What excellent service and a very nice gesture.   As for my lunch it was delicious and worth the cab fare and 6 yr wait. I also tried my son's meatball and it was light and fluffy - and soooo tasty. Pay these guys a visit today. Great service and great sandwiches."}
{"text":"I have been to several California Sandwich locations and I have found that this location is the best.  The quality of the sandwiches at this location are consistently better and larger than the other locations.  Also, this location is much busier than the others, so there is more turnover in their sandwiches, so they are fresher as they are continuously being made.  Service is always friendly and efficient allowing the lines to move quickly."}
{"text":"Great place for a veal or chicken sandwich! The sandwich portions are huge and I normally eat only half because it's so filling. The standard sandwich comes with thin pieces of breaded chicken or veal (or eggplant if you prefer vegetarian) and tomato sauce. There is also a list of other toppings that you can add at various prices. Hot peppers are free though.  I called the place first just to make sure that it wasn't too busy as I was driving a few km from work to grab lunch with a couple of coworkers. I was told that it wasn't very busy. We got there at around 12:45pm on a Monday and most of the tables were empty and no lineup. We sat down for a few minutes before our orders were called (it takes a few minutes). Eventually more people started to trickle in and it got fairly busy by the time we left.  The sandwich is tasty, flavourful, and as I said, portions are huge. We got the onion rings (meh). They also now serve sweet potato fries.  The price for a standard sandwich is about $9 which is pretty good considering the portion size. If you end up ordering all the toppings, you may be paying about $14-15 for a sandwich, but it would include toppings like eggplant, cheese, peppers, onions, mushrooms, etc.).  I would definitely come back here again for a chicken or veal sandwich if I'm in the area! :)  Note: Beware, get lots of napkins as it can be quite messy with the tomato sauce!"}
{"text":"It is, absolutely 3 dollars more expensive than I want it to be.  I find it tacky when you need to pay for each add on item.  Onions are onions, not extra.  That said, these are incredibly delicious, and this is a great location.  I never walk away hungry.  But be warned, they're bizarrely closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"I've tried the veal and the chicken, both yummy! I usually order myself a whole sandwich and save half for later (even though it gets soggy it's sooo good still, doesn't make sense!) I prefer the chicken, I always add cheese and usually add heat w the jalapeños. This time I tried it with the sweet pepper, it was good but I prefer it with a kick.  The mushrooms were really good on the veal!!  Can't go wrong. I've heard great things about the eggplant parmigiana, probably opt for that next time :)"}
{"text":"5 star might seem a bit generous but, I feel like in terms of a chicken sandwich, made fresh to order, for under $10 (that I wouldn't even be able to finish) this is definitely as good as it gets. It's a massive, full of flavour, and leaves you satisfied. I added cheese which just added to this 'fat kid special'. YUM!"}
{"text":"A solid sandwich joint. I especially like the italian sausage and meatball sandwiches.  It gets messy, so make sure you've grabbed napkins. Also, a defibrillator."}
{"text":"Best veal sandwiches in Toronto! Taste like home made Italian sauce with amazing veal! It's defiantly worth the $10. Don't forget to ask for salami on the side!"}
{"text":"Once in a while I'll get a craving for a messy sandwich.  For this fix one of the few places I go to is California Sandwiches.  Whether it's a hot veal, steak, or chicken cutlet sandwich this place has the right stuff.  At this particular location they're always busy so it's good to time when to go here and when to wait it out.  The place itself is well layed out.  Plenty of seating for big groups if you decide to dine there.  It runs very efficiently, you place your order and pay for it (unfortunately they only accept cash or debit...credit card is a no no).  Right away your sandwich is in the ready stages.  Not too long after that the lady calls out your number and you're all set to enjoy your meal.  I always go for their veal sandwich with mushrooms and onions.  If you're really feeling the munchies for double the price they give you double the meat, but the regular serving is more than enough.  They have a vegetarian option which is an eggplant in place of a meat.  Oh and a side of large olives is a must!"}
{"text":"My favourite is their steak sandwich. You can also get jalapeños in it, which I find aren't that spicy. My friends seem to love their veal sandwiches, I'm not a fan of it as I love the taste of the steak one more. It is all filled with tomato sauce, and their buns are really soft. Only downside is U have to eat it right away or the sauce will infuse with bread and make it really soggy."}
{"text":"Been a long time fan of the California Sandwiches Claremont and Queensway locations. Their recipe is the same and the same big huge portions! I always eat half for dinner and save the second half for lunch the next day!  Try the veal or the chicken!"}
{"text":"I knew I was being led astray when my non-foodie colleague suggested California Sandwiches.  So we drove for 10 minutes away from the office to have mediocre sandwiches that are on par with what is available at the cafeteria. TBH, I'v never been impressed with this type of food, it's just shitty meat topped with tomato sauce, processed cheese, canned vegetables on a kaiser bun.  Sandwiches start around $8.50, and they charge for each topping.  If I wanted carbs loaded with shitty meat and cheese, my choice would always be pizza, because at least there is a chance of pizza being good, unlike these soggy sandwiches.  Their $5 salad is acceptable, romaine lettuce with bits of cucumber and halved cherry tomatoes, decent sized too.  Tip: Use the self-serve kiosk, because the prices on the kiosk has not been updated to reflect the latest price increases.  You will save around $0.50 per sandwich."}
{"text":"It's all about the Veal Sandwich....I ordered the veal sandwich with mushroooms and peppers.  This f'in sandwich is big n sloppy when eating-Don't try to be an American and eat one of these while driving your Escalade unless you'd like spicy tomato sauced leather seats.  This thing is also two big to handle with one hand.  The friend veal is at times soggy, but in a good way.  This sandwich can not be matched anywhere in the world.  These folks keep it simple an perfect the veal sandwich like no other.  At the current Canadian exchange rate, it's kind of rich for my wallet, but well worth the experience.  I've eaten here twice and have not regretted it since!"}
{"text":"Ok, be prepared to get messy.  That being said, their Chicken Sandwich is delicious.  Big enough for 2 people, so I suggest ordering 1 and splitting and then ordering some olives and chips to share.  It is a total dive, but that is the charm.  They only take cash but have an ABM in the shop.  If you are looking for inexpensive and delicious this is the place for you."}
{"text":"First off,  I'm not a hig sandwhich fan to begin with.  I got the steak and onion sandwhich, which was large and messy....as most California style sandwhiches are.  The tomato sauce was sweet, the white bun was fluffy and absorbed the excess sauce.  However, there was something about the beef that just didn't sit well with me.  A little dry, a little tough, can't quite pin point it, but it was a little odd... The onion rings however were amazingly cripsy."}
{"text":"This place is KING of sandwiches. One of these gigator sandwiches can take a person out. Seriously. The following events happen every time you visit:  You smell it; your nose is on fire with love for that fried meat smell. You see it; it is a humongous slab of meat between two fresh pieces of bun, dripping with sauce, cheese, and extras. You touch it; it feels soft and warm and drippy with sauce. You bite into it; the experience of the tongue is one with the experience of the nose. You keep eating, and eating, and eating, and there is still a lot more sandwich left. Unfortunately for you, by now, you are addicted to the whole experience and cannot stop. Your stomach starts sending messages to suggest that perhaps the rest of the sandwich should be saved for later, but gets quickly vetoed by the nose and tongue. In time, you finish the sandwich. The stomach is beyond full and possibly angry. You sit there hoping and waiting for the stomach to digest a bit, and get rid of some of the discomfort you are feeling in your mid-section. You even begin considering that perhaps you may have over done it; maybe your stomach cannot get you out of this one. You sit for another 15 minutes in slight panic, but begin to realize that a fraction of the discomfort has subsided; you will live another day, and you will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The veal sandwich wasn't as good as it used to be. The bun is different than what I remember. This one was more dense and seemed a bit stale. It was disappointing since I haven't had it in years."}
{"text":"Honestly who eats subway? If you want a real meatball sandwhich this place is the real deal! I don't think there is much to be said about this place it's just plain amazing! It's the first California sandwhiches open and it was opened in 1967! My dad's been going here since he was a tot and introduced me to this place and I love it! The atmosphere is great typical Italian place the family who owns it still runs it and they argue in front of you they really don't give a shit who's listening, I normally order the hot meatball sandwhich and it doesn't get better then that! The sandwhich is huge I can't even finish it and normally I'm a pretty big eater! Careful though when they say spicy they aren't kidding, no other chain of this location matches up, the second best one would be the one on the queensway but honest it isn't the same! Do not where your favourite white shirt the sandwiches can get a little messy! Do not pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Why. Why. Why! Just the outside screams hipsters! Why would i go here. This is not California sandwiches this is another iconic Toronto chain becoming hipster and toutistfied please walk the extra 20 minutes to the original location and avoid this place!    Hopefully this place closes soon, I dont want to have to deal with the emotional pain of having to see this place."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop seems to enjoy a cult-like status in the area but I'm convinced it's utterly overrated. The staff are consistently miserable and rude and they only accept cash. The menu isn't very big and consists largely of very sloppy sandwiches that have a surplus of salty tomato sauce on white bread.  The sandwich quickly turns soggy and has an unpleasant texture. I've only been here twice and that was one too many times.  The seating area is small, crowded, and extremely loud at lunch time. I have no idea why they are so popular because in a city this big there are far better options."}
{"text":"You wont' be left hungry - hands down the best veal / chicken sandwich in the city. Attention to freshness and detail is evident in a super fresh soft bun, a light breaded veal - not over crunchy and not oily. Tomato sauce is authentic and just makes this Heaven on Earth!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad and soggy sandwich. Whatever you do do not take out or receive delivery from this chain. California Sandwiches is a US chain of sandwich shops expanding in Toronto. I would not support them. I can easily make a better sandwich, that is bigger, more delicious and better put together at home. Of course, it will cost less too. My small sandwich left me hungry (and I am not a big eater).Their 'veal' must have been wet because 5 minutes later when I was unwrapping my sandwich instead of sandwich I had a blobby soggy mess. The small bun was wet to the core. Yuck."}
{"text":"Eww. I had the beef, and it was smothered in hot pepper sauce which I did not want at all. The beef seemed either boiled or steamed; it was nothing like the roast beef that I was expecting. Also, the whole thing was soggy.  The cheese was so thin it was newly invisible. Also the staff seemed more interested in chatting among themselves than providing a good experience.  Oh, and the place was way too hot.  I was so hoping for a place where I could find a great roast beef sandwich. I guess the hunt is still on."}
{"text":"Went here today during my exam study break time to carb up, and carb up is what I did. I have the fried eggplant with vegetable toppings. The bread was perfectly delicious and so were the toppings. The only downside was that I asked for it to be spicy and it wasn't at all, and that it was super messy. I got sauce everywhere, and used a ridiculous amount of napkins.  Service was nice and friendly, I'll be back and I can't wait for my next messy and delicious visit."}
{"text":"quite possibly the best eggplant parm sandwich around. comes with cheese and the amount of eggplant is obscene.  always fresh, piping hot and bloody delicious.  the olives are just as amazing.  huge drink selection. reasonable prices and always consistent.  wish list:  1. clean/bus the dining room tables more often 2. empty the trash more frequently, often overflowing 3. increased friendliness in some of the employees.  sometimes i sense a bit of attitude.  that said, those three things haven't changed in the last few years and still, i come here at least twice a month."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this location because I walk by this restaurant to and from work every day. Unfortunately, this place is not like the original location. In all fairness the San Francesco sandwiches on Bay Street is also lacking in flavour and quality also.  I think the main issue is that the restaurant in the evenings are not family runned. They have hired young people that is not part of their original family. Therefore, it is only a job to them vs. the original location has family members who represent their food and service with family pride. It can make all the difference in the world.  I will probably go to the original location every so often. It is probably just as well because the sandwiches will be a real treat."}
{"text":"It is a rare occasion I don't cook. So you can imagine how happy I was to have a night off.  We decided to order Veal sandwiches, my husband had asked for hot peppers. We needed a magnifying glass to find them. Mine was medium peppers, again barely visible. Little to no sauce on the veal.  Can you imagine my disappointment? My one night off and what I craved was sub-power. I remember the California sandwiches down off of College  and Grace, Toronto. The veal sandwiches are so big you need to share it. And hot peppers are mind blowing hot. No comparison. Oh well, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. Guess where my next veal sandwich is coming from?"}
{"text":"Food is great but the service needs a lot of work. The cashier just seems pissed off with all the customers coming in. They only take cash which I struggle with considering the price of the sandwiches. The cashier had an annoyed tone when asking if they accept debit and told me to use the ATM. The restaurant also needs work as it appears worn out but spacious"}
{"text":"No credit or debit accepted so had to use the  on site ATM which cost an additional $2. Very limited menu - essentially five or so items to pick from. Mac Salad was disgusting who puts lettuce in mac salad? Sandwich wasn't anything all that special. They need a better ordering system too - it was chaos in here. Have these folks ever heard of pagers? Not sure why it so busy but I won't be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"What can I say about California Sandwiches? Soft bun tender meat awesome sauce and the hot peppers! Heaven on a plate. At this location everything is good but I feel that the chicken is the best here!  The spicy olives are also a hit! If you see the Californias sign pull over for a great lunch/dinner!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to California since I was a young girl in Toronto. This place is still awesome and they have the best sandwiches around. I had the veal with provolone and I was not dissapointed. Two sandwiches and two bottles of soda came to about 26 bucks. The sandwiches are really large and taste amazing. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite places to grab a quick bite. They have one of the best vegetarian sandwiches which is a must try (Eggplant Parm).  Full disclosure I actually hate eggplants but this is the only place I would eat it at. Also there location on Dufferin  has a Bun-less eggplant parmigiana which is like a lasagna loaded with cheese, eggplant & more cheese.   Great option if your trying to cut the carbs but still want a tasty meal to fill you up."}
{"text":"Probably the worst location. There was hardly anyone there at lunch and the service was painfully slow.  Not to mention this is the only location that cant get the breading to stay on the sandwich."}
{"text":"Place got some good service and food.  One knock is their prices for toppings you think for $9.25 you would get any toppings of your liking nope.  Even then the toppings are 1-2$ bucks a pop.  Gets expensive really fast.  Bring lots of money when you roll here.  Chicken veal and steak are good"}
{"text":"+ great veal sandwiches + good menu variety - service is a tad slow  Recommended: Veal Sandwich"}
{"text":"A great place for a quick bite in this area. High quality food and service. It's a little hidden away in the rather large plaza surrounding the sketchy flea market.   Inside is quite large and has plenty of seating, even for larger groups. There is a nice modern look and feel to the decor.   The menu is short and sweet but there's something on it for everyone. They are known for the sandwiches, so that's what I ordered.   I got the eggplant sandwich with hot peppers. That was the only free topping and they had a few other options, such as cheese or mushrooms. The sandwiches are made fresh as you order so they are nice and hot when you get them. They don't take much time either! I had mine ready in less than 10 mins, maybe closer to 5 mins. The sandwich was rather large and even without a side, it was quite a mission to finish it! For those who want a smaller meal, there are mini versions of the sandwiches as well. Something I may consider next time.   The service here was really great! Friendly and quick.   There wasn't anything bad I could really say. I highly recommend checking this place out. I know I'll be back to try more things!"}
{"text":"So happy this place opened up in my hood.  California Sandwiches, after all is said and done, is a $10 sandwich worth every penny. why?  It's authentic italian man-wich style It's bigger than your mouth can wrap around and will last the next day Tastes amazing, and when they say spicy, they mean it Service is excellent. It's a bunch of young ppl just doing a good job. If they make a mistake, they're reasonable about it and more than fix it. Service are all good looking which doesn't hurt the eyes Interior is clean and neat Good selection of extras - sausage, tiramisu, drinks, etc  I order from here so often now that i have them in my fone 905-237-4703  The two drawbacks: The only only annoying thing is they only accept cash. has often made me decide not to go because i can't be bothered to withdraw cash first.  Mushrooms are canned, not fresh."}
{"text":"No need to talk about the famous veal sandwich here.  If you haven't tried, you just need to.  Recommend hot veal with mushrooms and jalapeño, and some olives to trim.... fixes me every time.   The only drawback with this place is the wait.  On a busy Friday evening, you need to budget at least half an hour - 10 minutes to wait in line to order and 20 for your sandwich.  Not exactly a fast food speed.?Even when I order in advance by phone somehow I always seem to have to wait when I get there.    Despite this, people flock here for the sandwich, reinforcing the old adage that good things come to those who wait."}
{"text":"i would recommend no stars if I could. I see this place all the time and finally went in to try it. The food is WAY overpriced, no choices, bland sauce, and poor quality meat. I went in with my boyfriend and neither of us finished our food. I think your money is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"California sandwiches are usually great sandwiches. But going out to eat is an experience. It encompasses location, atmosphere, mood and of course the food.   I came for a sandwich and let me say first off the hop I wasn't feeling it this time. The girl who took our order was a total b*¥h. Total attitude. Then when I got my sandwich it looked great but it wasn't cut properly and when I tried to pull it apart the entire sandwich fell apart. I hate when a sandwiches fall completely apart. So I had to eat the sandwich is pieces. The taste was there but they're going to hire a bunch of dummies that don't care about the food or service then why even be there. Dare I say this is the last time I come to this location. FYI,  the new Rutherford location across from Wegz does it pretty well.  Cheers"}
{"text":"The Good Big sandwiches/burgers  The bad No fries, expensive for a sandwich place  The ugly  The pasta sauce they use in the sandwiches  With the Richmond hill serving halal meat we made our way here only to find messy pasta sauce buns. If only they did not overload the pasta sauce which stole the crispy meaty flavour from my veal schnitzel and eventually gave way to the lower bun dropping a soggy schlump!! On my lap Perhaps its just me but pasta sauce in a burger is just a bad idea  2 sandwiches 1 brio n olives on the side $30 plus. Neveragain...."}
{"text":"Love their sandwiches!! Find it a bit pricey but I usually eat only half at a time and save the other yummy goodness half for later. So hard to choose from all the toppings because they are all very good!!  salivating!"}
{"text":"I've been to another location near Yorkdale, which seemed better. I ordered the standard--veal sandwich, as did my friend, who ordered with extra jalapenos. The portions are huge. Also they pour tomato/marinara sauce over the veal and then wrap the sandwich up. In terms of the flavour--nothing special. The veal was a bit tough, the breading was alright and the marinara was just fine. The bread became soggy with every bite. My friend said with the jalapeno peppers made the sandwich a bit spicier but not that much better.   From what I remember, toppings are extra. So not that cheap! The sandwiches were $8.19 each, around $15 after tax and a drink. I don't think I'll try this location again. Too bad."}
{"text":"Plummeted since my last visit. This location seems to have let itself go. The fridge that usually displays available sides was completely empty, no sides, no drinks in the fridge and the sandwich was just way off. Needless to say my craving was left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"This place is so great. I would eat here forever if I could. My go to sandwich is chicken with cheese and medium spicy sauce. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"The original, and is always amazing. I stick to Veal but i've heard people rave about other things on the menu. Has an old school charm to it."}
{"text":"My coworker was raving about California Sandwiches and since I was looking to try something new, I headed up Yonge to find the location. I've actually walked by here before and never noticed it. It's tucked between a few stores and next to an abandoned burger joint.  I came in and was surprised at how limited the menu was although this seems to be the case with many places these days. Specialize in one thing and (hopefully) do it well. I figured I couldn't go wrong with a veal sandwich since it seemed to be the main sandwich people were ordering and it was at the top of the menu. I added provolone cheese, onions and mushrooms to my sandwich and added a bottle of pop. All together, over $15 for the sandwich and drink. A little steep considering there was no side. I did glance at their desserts, but they serve them in mason jars, so a small mason jar of tiramisu was about $6 before tax. Not worth it!  Walked back to the office, less than 5 minutes, and dug in. First thing (and not surprising), the whole thing was soggy. Either eat in or don't bother if you can't stand soggy sandwiches. The bottom was just as soggy as the top even though the cheese was placed to be a barrier against the bread. Secondly - SALT. HOLY MOTHER OF SALT. WOW. The more I ate, the more salty it got, and it wasn't the cheese because provolone isn't a super salty cheese. I think it was the breading on the veal but it was too much for me. The sandwich is HUGE. I get why it was priced so highly. Get one and split it with someone because one sandwich is too much for one person like me at lunchtime. I got medium sauce and it was fine, but I didn't ask for peppers or jalapenos and I think one or the other was put on my sandwich because after a few bites, there was a low-flame fire going on in my mouth. When I pulled the sandwich apart, there were what I think were jalapenos that I didn't ask for. Mushrooms and onions were present and in abundance.  I really wanted to like this place, but no. The sandwich was too salty, altogether too big (and I like value for money, when the food is good) and disappointing. Nothing was special about this sandwich, nothing made it stand out. It was mediocre at best and I could easily make something better at home or, I'm sure, find an italian joint that makes a better version. The fact that it got soggy within minutes means that even if you did eat in, by the time you got to the second half it would be soggy for sure.  Overall, underwhelming. There are much better food joints in the area that are reasonably priced AND tasty. Do yourself a favor and walk half a block south to Bahn Mi Boys and get yourself something tasty."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong at California Sandwiches! Best customer service, greatest most delicious Italian sandwiches and absolutely love the tomato sauce.    My favourite would have to be the chicken, extra sauce, and spicy! I have been getting it for years and its always as delicious as the first time.  No Surprises!!!  My friends have tried the eggplant and the veal and were licking their lips each time with each sandwich and voted them to have the best sandwiches! I totally recommend this place.  LOVE it here!  Great staff and food!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious.  Small eating area. Some great  alternatives to meat.  Sandwiches are very large and can easily be spilt between two people."}
{"text":"I can never get enough of their Eggplant Parmesan.  Portion size is huge Service is quick."}
{"text":"Sweet chicken and veal sandwiches were so delicious!!! Too delicious that I even forgot to take pictures before I started eating.. GO and check it out, you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"For a great sandwich at a great price you can't beat California Sandwiches!  We have tried pretty much every combination and every location and have not been disappointed.  My personal favourite is the veal with medium sauce (decent spice but not so much that it numbs your tongue), mushrooms, sweet peppers and cheese.  I have yet to finish a sandwich on the first try so can vouch for the fact that they taste pretty darn good the next day.  Nothing fancy just good messy sandwiches. Be warned though -once you've had a California Sandwich no other veal sandwich will measure up."}
{"text":"Tasty sandwiches when in a hurry for something to eat. Not a fancy place but clean. Sometimes you see nonna making the veal cutlets in the back. Love that. Delicious veal on a bun. And good Italian tomato sauce. Good quick meal."}
{"text":"best veal and chicken sandwiches in the city, and they are as big as your head!  Sauce is tasty, toppings can add up fast if you want your sammy loaded... my only complaint is minor, they could get a better bun, but really it is just a means to hold all that deep fried breaded and sauced meaty goodness!  If you like it spicy, order it hot, but be warned, some days those peppers are crazy spicy!  The tiny napkins they put in the bag are a joke, but they do put tons of them in because they know just how messy you can get when you dive in and take those first several bites.... yummy!  Be prepared for crazy long wait times, especially on Friday nights, they make it all fresh and it is a popular place!"}
{"text":"Not all California Sandwiches are alike...   I have been going to the original Claremont location for more than 25 years and the quality, size, and taste have remained the same, whether it was nice old Nonnas in the kitchen yelling in Italian, or their granddaughters who graduated to the kitchen from the front cash.  When this location on Yonge opened, I was excited because it is sooooo close to home.  But my first visit was disappointing so I thought I would wait and give them another try after they got over the growing pains of just opening.  Since then, I've had many sandwiches from the Claremont location - hubby loves the hot chicken with the works on it, and I'm more about sweet veal with a side order of peppers so I can control the heat - some days those peppers are atomically hot and I use a tiny bit, and other days not too bad and I use the entire dip size container.  You can order all sandwiches sweet = no peppers, medium = a bit of peppers, or hot = lots of peppers, or peppers on the side like me.  Every sandwich from Claremont was HUGE - as in, it didn't feel safe to carry the paper bag with 2 sandwiches in it, for fear the bottom would break.   Every sandwich was delicious, and filling, and perfectly fried and sauced.  I avoided the location on Yonge until today, the place was packed with the lunch crowd... a good sign, or so I thought.  The sandwiches from this location are easily half the size for the same price.  Normally I can hardly eat half a sandwich, but from Yonge, I almost ate the entire sandwich.  The bun here had cornmeal which I don't like, and the sauce is much less flavourful and I got a strong olive taste I did not like.  If I had never had a sandwich from the original location , I would have considered this one \"okay\" but not the deliciousness that I have loved over the years.  So, sadly I'm not giving this location another shot.  It truly is worth the drive (or streetcar) to Claremont.  If you have tried a sandwich here and didn't like it go to the original and best location.  If you liked it and want to try the real deal, Claremont is where to go... With the Queensway location (next to Burgers Priest) a not too close second."}
{"text":"Real Classic Italian taste! The chicken and veal are out of this World but for the vegetarian the eggplant is equally as great. If I had my choice of a last meal this would be it. One of those rare foods you find yourself craving to have again and again. Keep up the great tase. Bon Appetit"}
{"text":"Why I thought this place would be better the 2nd time around is beyond me - I should've known.  Canned mushrooms?! Seriously?!  The sandwich is huge sure but the quality is at best 1.5 stars - \"sautéed\" onions are barely sauteed and the mushrooms are canned! Who still uses those in Toronto?! The kaiser was meh as was the veal but really just barely pass that 2 star mark. Sandwiches from San Remo (eto), Francesca (scarb) and Porchetta (dt) have spoiled me - quality is evident at those places as is definitely not the case at California Sandwiches. Will never try again."}
{"text":"I love California sandwiches. I generally always order the eggplant parm. This time my sister told me try it w the chicken as well. So i did the chen parm add breades eggplant. It was super delicious. Crispy and flavourful, not too much sauce, right amoint of cheese and onions.  Of coirse the sandwich is huge so I ate half and my friend enjoyed the other half. Will definitely be back  * ordered through skip the dishes*  Came nice amd hot on arrival not one complaint."}
{"text":"I have had this eatery bookmarked for the longest time. I finally took the plunge and visited the place last night.  I was in the area to pick up a gently used paper shredder. I already have one that works well. However, the container is small and the frequent emptying of it got to me. My new one worked out nicely.  After having picked up my shredder, I was hungry and needed dinner. This eatery was five minutes away from the seller's home. Perfect!  California Sandwiches is located in a plaza, across from a Petro-Canada station that I recently frequented. This plaza has a Denny's and Tim Horton's.  I parked and walked in. The eatery is bright and clean. I walked up to the counter and immediately placed my order.  I have fond memories as a teenager of my dad buying me a veal sandwich from a food truck, so I could have it for lunch the following day at school. I loved this sandwich so much. The veal was tender. It also came with mushrooms and peppers, with a cheerful tomato sauce.  Naturally, I went with the veal sandwich. The last time I ordered a veal sandwich, I pilled on so many veggies that they all slid out of my sandwich. I learned my lesson this time. I went with mushrooms only.  I got a Diet Dr. Pepper. You don't see too many of those. When I do, I'm at a gas station! You basically help yourself by selecting the beverage that you want from the fridge.  I paid by debit. You can also pay by credit card and cash.  There was one other customer waiting for his order. I tried figuring out where I wanted to sit. I chose a table with leather seats on one side, and wooden chairs on the other. I was facing one of the two TVs in the restaurant, so I could watch and eat.  I was impressed at how quickly my sandwich was made. I had barely settled into my seat and was checking my e-mail when the friendly woman came over with my sandwich. Wow!  The sandwiches here are massive! Sure, you are paying nearly $10 for your base sandwich. However, it's worth it.   I was thankful that my sandwich was cut in half. I was also supplied with a generous supply of napkins. You will need them! My sandwich was a couple of inches high. Generous portions of tender, lightly breaded veal and sliced mushrooms were in my sandwich, with deliciously fresh, soft bread holding everything together.  Memories of eating veal sandwiches as a teenager came back. So good! So messy! So me!  The bathroom was clean. I noticed when I got back to my table that there was a paper plate underneath the leather bench. It's the only thing that I can think of that could be improved upon.  If you want a delicious, made-to-order sandwich that is ready for you quickly and are a veal fan, I'd recommend visiting this place. I will definitely be back.  (76)"}
{"text":"California Sandwiches as the name implies specializes in hot veal, chicken, and steak Italian sandwiches. They have several locations in the city which all serve the same menu. As previously noted, their sandwiches are quite large but then again you're paying around $8-9 just for the sandwich so they better be big! Several locations do mini-sandwiches for around $5. Put it this way, the $5 mini is a \"reasonable\" portion and the regular size is huge.   Taste-wise, probably one of the best veal sandwiches I've eaten. The veal is lightly breaded, just as it should be and the tomato sauce nicely compliments it. The bun is a fresh, Italian roll that's not too soft, but not crispy...just the way I like it! For those who like a little heat, California Sandwiches offers several levels of heat from Mild all the way up to Extra Hot. The heat comes in the form of what appears to be a roasted jalapeno pepper spread. In my opinion, it's far better than just the typical chili flakes most places offer when a person wants some heat.   A varied array of sandwiches including veal, chicken, steak, sausage, meatball, and veggie are available. All additional toppings (with the exception of the hot peppers) are an additional cost. This is probably my biggest negative when it comes to California Sandwiches. Considering the cost of their food, I feel that the sandwich should at least come with a choice of 1 topping. Pricing for the toppings varies between $0.50 and $2 depending on what you want. That is the primary reason they're only 4 stars in my view.  Despite the feeling of being ripped off for extra toppings, I keep returning to California Sandwiches because the product is great!   Cash only!"}
{"text":"Cash only.  That's not good when you have to take out for 8.  The sandwiches are massive, but the meatball/veal is pretty bland.  LOTS of filler, so it's like having a bread sandwich.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"I ordered the meatball sandwich today for lunch and was sorry that I didn't notice there was a smaller size available. It weighed a ton! I could only do half in one go; the other half is lunch tomorrow. It was hella messy, but pretty tasty. I'm not sure how I feel about paying for every single extra topping. Really, shouldn't it come with at least one for the price of the sandwich? But I guess that is nitpicking. I tried a couple of my friend's sweet potato fries and they were absolutely awesome! Totally worth the calories. Honestly, I don't think my waistline will allow me to visit more than once in a very long while, but it was a pretty enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"It's been about 15 years since I have been to California Sandwiches.  I was worried that like many restaurants it may have lost its edge over the years. I was happy to discover the great sandwich that I remember from years ago. The massive breaded chicken cutlet on a soft bun with the spicy tomato sauce was incredible.  For $7.95 you can't go wrong. Can't wait to go back. Great job Cali San!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy they finally opened one of these in Richmond Hill.  I love their veal sandwich with the works, the spicier the better.  It is so filling that I leave 1/2 for my lunch the next day.  A minute and a half in the microwave and it is ready to eat.    This location does not accept debit or credit cards - only cash."}
{"text":"I write this review during the Jewish holiday of Passover, when observant Members of the Tribe refrain from the consumption of leavened bread (otherwise known as 'bread'), and eat only Matzo; an unleavened bread made solely of flour and water. It is justifiably known as the \"bread of affliction\" although it seems to be pretty popular with non-Jews--I suspect because they only ever eat it by choice, rather than out of a sense of religious duty.   Off to top of my head, I can't think of anything that would be eligible for consumption over Passover at California Sandwiches. Other than spiced olives, which are delish (meaty, briny, spicy, salty), but hardly a balanced meal...mind you, most of the menu errs on the side of 'delicious' rather than 'balanced'.  And delicious it is. If you're coming to California Sandwiches, chances are you're coming for a Sandwich. A giant sandwich packed with pounded and breaded and fried meat, sloppy with homemade marinara sauce, on a giant puffy kaiser.   Veal and chicken versions arrive piping hot, the meat occupying multiple points along the chewy-tender spectrum, even within the same piece. No matter; it's all crispy golden and bathed in chunky sauce that deserves it's own review. Chunky and homemade and bright, unlike others that are drowned in sugar. Vegetarians and meatheads alike will enjoy the eggplant parm version. definitely tender and subject to the same crustification as the meat versions, it's a heck of a sandwich in it's own right. Be warned, any of these options are a race against time: fresh and airy kaiser buns don't hold out for long against the saucy assault.   Cheese (provolone) and most other veggies (e.g. mushrooms, onions, sweet peppers) are added on at a premium. I resent this policy, since it inflates my reasonable $8 sandwich to an ungodly $10 plus bacchanal if i add more than one. A tough row to hoe for a cheap local lunch. Damage can be mitigated by ordering the smaller version of the sandwich-about $4, and let's face it, already more than enough food from your dietician's perspective.   California sandwiches aren't about perspective. They're about abondanza, so let those toppings fly (still, 50 cents for a tablespoon of sauteed mushrooms? It is to laugh). Jalapenos are free, so there's that. I like Jalapenos, so I often order my sandwich \"hot\", over the objections of my digestive tract. I also go for the provolone and the broccoli rabe; the bitterness cuts nicely through the richness of the other ingredients, and I can make believe I'm eating healthy since it's a vegetable. Eating my greens, yo!   Side dishes are good...the aforementioned olives, and surprisingly crunchy onion rings of doubtful provenance are worth sharing (you'll never finish an order yourself). Standard sodas plus italian versions (San Pellegrino Limone or GTFO), and strong-brewed Illy coffee close out the meal. There are cute desserts in Mason jars, but I don't want to fall asleep when I get back to work.   Service is great! Warm and friendly and attentive...I'm duly impressed. Even more duly impressed by the washrooms, which are modern and clean and private (a rarity downtown these days).   Today is the second-last day of passover. Anyone wanna guess where I'm headed once it's finished?"}
{"text":"An Italian sandwich is a thing of beauty. Claremont California  Sandwiches will never disappoint ( unless you forget the only take cash, but there is an ATM and/or  you are trying to impress someone by not getting the most amazing tomato sauce all over your face)."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I always get the veal sandwich. It is massive and delicious. $10 will get you a huge sandwich that is good enough for two. Can't beat the price and taste. Veal, tomato sauce and mushrooms."}
{"text":"You gotta get the veal. So satisfying. So delicious. I got the mini and it was a good size sandwich; the regular is massive! Got the steak and added cheese for my boyfriend - I ate that too. The steak was a teeeensy bit chewy but nothing you can't chew on. I can't wait to go back for more. Gotta try the chicken next time. I'LL BE BACK SOON"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic veal and chicken sandwiches; the portions are huge and the tomato sauce they use is delicious! The olives are great too:)"}
{"text":"California's definitely lives up to the hype for me! We stopped by here before a big night out and my friend kept telling me the best part of the night would be coming back home to eat the rest of the sandwich! Fortunately/unfortunately he was definitely right! The veal sandwich with grilled peppers and tomatoes w/ sauce on the side is a foolproof choice (as long as you like peppers)! The chicken would be my second option at least until I try the famed eggplant parm!  Aside from the lineup which can get a little long sometimes, one slightly bothersome fact is that the place really smells liked frying oil and they have a bit of a ventilation issue. That being said, you can simply wait outside while your order is prepared! Great spot and for me better than SanFrancesco's"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ordered their chicken sandwich to share, and their portion is huge. So either go with the mini or order their normal size sandwiches if you have a big appetite or for sharing. We added provolone cheese, mushrooms and jalapeño peppers, and surprisingly the jalapeño peppers had some good heat!  I've been to California sandwiches in the Queensway location, and had their schnitzel and nothing to brag about. But this chicken sandwich was the bomb. It was packed with some sweetness and tang from the tomato sauce, and nice heat from the jalapeño and balanced flavours.  The only downside is the bottom half of the bun gets soggy if you order it to go. Otherwise it's amazing and I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"California love.......  Great veal sandwich with peppers. Ask for it to be cut in half when you order. Not after. Beware.   Go, now. Eat it. Yum."}
{"text":"im usually a veal+ cheese+mushrooms+onions kind of guy but today i went for the MINI chicken+cheese+mushrooms+onions, a bottle of iced tea, and also sweet fries.  the emphasis on the mini was because im comparison to my friends regular sized sandwich, i think the accidently gave me a regular sized sandwich too.  the sweet fries were passable but i'd rather have the sweet potato fries that mcdonalds was testing out a few months ago.   sandwiches are delicious as always but for what i got, your looking at $15 and change. maybe a good thing because if it was cheaper, i'd probably eat here too much."}
{"text":"I ordered the veal cutlet sandwich and thought it was very yummy.  The kaiser roll was great.  My vegetarian boyfriend made me feel a little guilty because I was eating the veal.  But, in my defense, it was my first time eating veal.  The portion is pretty large but I ate 3/4 of it because it was so good.  Next time, I would get it with the sweet peppers or an additional topping.  Since it's so big, I would want another flavor with it.  Although, if I'm with my bf, I would probably try the eggplant parm so I'll be guilt free!"}
{"text":"Used to be a great joint to grab an Italian sandwich.  Has gone downhill since its opening. The girls behind the counter NEVER smile...and while they aren't rude, they certainly aren't friendly. I've stopped going here altogether because of the service. It's a shame too bc I've been a regular of this location as well as the Etobicoke one. Smile girls! If you hate your job that much do something else."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM  delicious sandwiches.  The chicken and veggie are to die for."}
{"text":"Usually I go for the chicken parm but today I decided to try the sausage with onions, mushrooms and cheese.. I was not disappointed! The sausage was so tasty and juicy.. I'm still drooling.. My fiancé got the veal as always and he says it keeps getting better and better.. I think I'll try the eggplant next time! I highly recommend! Keep up the amazing food!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! I grew up eating at the downtown location which was just awesome but the bun was stale here the meat chewy and despite giving it so many chances it continued to disappoint !!! Too bad as I really used to love this place downtown !! Olives are still good though..."}
{"text":"My first time at California Sandwich. The experience has left me wanting to go back for more. The mini sandwich that I ordered was really more than I could have asked for a lunch meal. The sandwich was spicy and messy which in my book can only mean DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"All I can say is I WISH SOMEONE WROTE THE MUSHROOMS WERE CANNED IN A REVIEW. I see now from their website they have photos and good grief, why is it ok for this chain to use disgusting rubbery canned mushrooms and charge extra for them, but everything else is fresh? There is no excuse. I am beyond disappointed and grossed out my eggplant sandwich was ruined by canned mushrooms. #Lessonlearned"}
{"text":"Best parm sandwiches. The sandwiches are huge, tasty and good for your money. My fave sandwich place by far. Would recommend for a quick bite and definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"I had passed this place dozens of times and finally went there 2 weeks ago out of convenience (location) to meet someone.  I thought for sure it'd be lame compared to an independent Italian deli.  What a nice surprise! I've been back since and have tried the veal, chicken and meatball. All very GOOD!! There's always a line-up, which I don't mind! It means it's fresh and tastes like it. Veal or chicken are $8 (not including toppings) 1-2$ each. Excellent value and good taste for the price. Drinks, a bit $.  I saw some people get beer on tap. Great!  Hey, they DON'T have an extensive menu and I love that! Just do a few things really well. For vegetarians, they have eggplant and I love the choice of toppings; along with the usual, they have rapini! Yum! (makes me feel less guilty that I'm having veg...lol), and yes the sammies are huge! Anyone who thinks it's 'expensive' needs to pack a lunch. This good food for fair price. Seeing the prev. reviews - FYI, they take debit and CC."}
{"text":"Best Italian sandwiches in the city in my opinion. Lots of sauce, sandwiches are massive. Service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"If you like big balls dripping with sauce and stuffed between large buns then this is the place for you.    This is what you can expect if you get the meatball sandwich like I did.  Large balls of meat the size of your fist and a kaiser bun as big as a bowling ball, all drowning in tomato sauce.  Other selections include the veal or chicken cutlet, steak, veggi, and others all ranging in price from $6 to $8.  All you get on your sandwich is the meat and sauce so if you want cheese, sauteed mushrooms or oinions then fork over a buck or two for each one.    The place wasn't bad, nor really great either.  I'll probably go back sometime but its not going to be a regular occurrence."}
{"text":"Since most people will order the first thing on the menu when they go to unfamiliar places, for my first experience at California Sandwiches, this will be their Veal Sandwich ($6.86)   The girl at the cash that took my order is young, skinny, smiley and blond.. fit the California theme :P   The veal sandwich is ready in 5 minute when my number was called. I found it A-OK. The bun though is a little soggy for my preference but the veal is soft and moist. Loaded with hot pepper definitely give the sandwich a good kick!   Plenty of seatings....over looking the parking lot... or you can stuff your face with tomato sauce while watching CNN.   Cash only, but no worries there is an ATM in the restaurant if you need some.

{"text":"It's been a long time since I came to California sandwiches but I tried it after a 5+ year gap and it was not what I remembered it to be.   I got the veal sandwich and the meat was pounded to holy hell. It was also chewy and tough. The flavour of the cheese and mushroom (extra $) did not come through. The breading on the meat was pretty good though but what was not good was the bread. Since the place was pretty busy, all you see on people's plates were ripped up pieces of bread to be thrown away - and with good reason too. The bread was tough, like, stale bread that you microwaved just to eat. It soaked the sauce which also made for a soggy treat   Their hot plates looked good though, maybe if I return I'll try those."}
{"text":"As an Italian, I know my veal sandwiches. And as much as the interior of California Sandwiches reminds me of my nonna's basement (not exactly a compliment), it's just not my favourite place to go for veal.  Their sandwiches have a LOT of meat in them, and they're often not the greatest cuts. I found them quite chewy and fatty, and it did not make me feel great about eating them. Extra toppings like mushrooms and cheese cost money, and they don't taste great without them. The buns are sometimes stale and could use a little warming up at least before I devour them.  And I know mess isn't a way to judge a veal sandwich, but this was the messiest sandwich I have ever eaten. All the pieces of the sandwiches were so mismatched in size that they just fell out. Why wouldn't everything stay in the bun? I've never had such problems at Mustachio's.  If you're on College St and you want veal, California Sandwiches might hit the spot. But if you have the time, just go to Mustachio's. Way better, less messy, and fresher ingredients (and all the toppings come on your sandwich already!). Plus the service at Mustachio's is ridiculously fast. I waited about 25 minutes for my sandwich here, and it wasn't even during peak hours, the employees were just chit-chatting about someone's wedding while we waited. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Schnitzle - Italian style. California needs to be on any list that has the word Schnitzel.  Amazing fresh baked kaiser with breaded chicken n' stuff in the middle.  Can be a bit of a wait at Lunch time, say, 5-10 minutes, but sooo worth it.  Parking can be a challenge to, if, you weren't on a bike or Vespa."}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for the veal 'sagweech' for the last 10 years. Between all the California Sandwiches locations, there are only 2 that I will go to - this one on Claremont and the one on the Queensway near Kipiling. Of course, Claremont ranks #1 in my books! Eating in is the way to go of course with the tender veal and the crunchy breading coming together with a freakishly good sauce all held in place by the perfect bun!  Here's what I'm going to recommend when you take it to go - order the veal on the bun with NO sauce. Get a cup (yes a CUP) of sauce on the side, the green crushed jalapeños and a small order of olives. Then go where you need to go, sit down and eat the damn thing. The veal will stay crunchy and the bread won't soak up all the sauce and break down too quickly if you put it together.  Im always about the extra sauce here - eating in or taking out.  There's a reason why this review doesn't have pictures - this isn't a place for Instagram. This is a place where you order your massive veal sandwich, sit down, shut up and eat. (They also have minis if thats more your jam!)  Lastly, this washes down BEST with a Brio. No compromise. No diets.  OoOh they will also sell you their sauce if you are nice - bring a glass jar."}
{"text":"What can i say but yum yum yum yum and a little more yum.  My go to place for veal on a bun with repeat orders of the same thing every time. Veal with peppers and cheese with jalapeño, extra sauce and olives on the side.  You should really spend the extra dollar or two on the extra sauce as it makes all the difference. I really like my Italian sandwiches drenched in sauce.  They have really long line ups during lunch so if you have a sizable order, it would be best to call in the order earlier in the day."}
{"text":"I've been to other locations of this franchise and the quality doesn't seem to vary too much. Be sure to eat the sandwich while it's piping hot otherwise it can get soggy as it sits. I like these sandwiches cause they're huge - usually good enough for lunch and bit some. I can never seem to finish it in one sitting. In terms of choices I suggest either the veal or chicken. They come smothered in sauce, but when is that a bad thing?! It can quickly rack up in price if you add toppings so I choose the simple sandwich or add provolone or mushrooms. It's still delicious with sauce alone.  The customer service at this location was meh. The cashier answered my questions but had a dismissive attitude. I went during a slow time before the lunch rush but I can imagine it getting packed. There was quite a few seats around but you never know when it gets busy."}
{"text":"Wow!  Just moved in to the neighborhood and what do I find but my favorite Italian sandwich shop opened a location 30s from my apartment.  I walk in and order my standard Medium Chicken with Cheese and Onions.   It was perfect .   The sauce  amazing and the girl working the counter was cute too.  For desert they have these tiramisus in these little jars that are fantastic."}
{"text":"If you love veal sandwiched then this is the place to go.  Go in and order the spicy veal sandwich and make sure you ask for cheese and mushrooms (both extra, but well worth it) and I guarantee that you will be satisfied.  The sandwiches are nice and big so don't worry about one sandwich not being enough guys.  I have been to a few other places that serve some good veal sandwiches, but this one is the best value and tastes awesome.  If you're hungry and in the mood for a good sandwich, skip the Big Mac and give this place a shot."}
{"text":"I'm willing to give it another shot but I went here last night and the sandwich, while hefty and meaty lacked taste.  I had it plain and sweet so maybe more sauce or hot peppers or other toppings would have helped.  San Francesco (couple min walk away, where I go much more frequently) is $1.75 cheaper and a more reasonable (eg. smaller) portion for one.  Also a longer wait at California.  Their website states a veal sandwich 500 calories, 25 Grams of Fat & 20 Grams of Carbohydrates.  \"I think I'll type that up on my invisible typewriter\" Chief Wiggum.   ETA - OK, OK... I guess I can't update my review after only a few days but went here as part of a Yelp event and had part of someone's chicken, cheese, mushroom sandwich.  Much better.  Next time I will order a sandwich with cheese and extra sauce (medium heat) and would go to a 4 if all goes well."}
{"text":"The \"veal\" sandwich is actually red meat I believe.  It was a big, sloppy, oozing mess but I enjoyed it.  Bottled drinks to choose from with the 'wich."}
{"text":"This is California Sandwiches...all you other Sandwich places bow down to it's supremacy.  Fortunately, my neighbourhood (Vaughan) has a smaller version of this massive place....but the quality of the food remains consistent. Once, while in the restaurant in Vaughan, I heard a customer ask one of the owners if they franchise, as he lived in Barrie and thought it would be great to have one up there...the owner responded that it is family run and operated so franchises are not available. This is how things remain consistent. This location is huge, but finding seating can still be difficult as it's popular. Everyone I come here with goes for the veal...I go for the chicken. It is delicious with just the right amount of sauce. Get the cheese and hot peppers and you'll be in heaven. I've also had the meatball (a bit too much garlic for me...but I loved it going in), the steak and onions (wow) and have never been disappointed. About a year and a half they started offering smaller versions of their signature beasts....but let's be real...go for the real thing. Oh ya, they have like a hot table....but good luck if you're having a sandwhich."}
{"text":"Typical California Sandwich...you know what you're going to get. Person working the counter was phenomenal.  Only complaint is that the sauce was more watery than tomatoey.....it was really watered down. Disappointing as the sauce is a big component of the sandwich.  Place was spotless"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken sandwich. Asked for onion and hot peppers. I got triple onion and no hot pepper.  Called to let them know the teenager who was the acting manager was rude and argumentative. Accused me on not ordering hot peppers. I told her I double checked the receipt.  She then said I probably can't see the hot peppers because it's a spread.  Umm this isn't the first time I have had this.  No help. The owners are loosing business because they hire completely incompetent staff.  The Winston Churchill and queens ways locations are amazing.   Skip heartland"}
{"text":"I have no idea how \"as the name implies\" relates to California.  I was expecting a healthy sandwich shop, and instead I stepped into a 80's Italian joint, complete with gut bomb sandwiches.  The sandwiches here are huge, bready, sloppy and lacking flavor.  Severely missing salt, at least with whatever I had.  Sorry my Canadian friends, I know this is a Toronto institution and all, but I just don't get it...mediocre sandwiches at best.  It's clearly popular though, as I showed up at lunch time and the line was a good 20 people deep...but don't let that scare you; if you made it this far, stick around, as the line moves quickly."}
{"text":"Food is great, prices are great and you always have enough left-over for the next day :) One of my favourite sandwich places."}
{"text":"This location is great. I prefer California Sandwiches over Five guys any day. And I'm a burger guy. But I blame it on the Italian in me.  Line up's can be long and seating can be limited, so perhaps order in advance for take out. Sweet veal with cheese and mushroom's is heaven sent. Thank you to the Nonna's who made that sauce. Mmm!"}
{"text":"The Philly steak was hearty, rich and hit the spot. Meat drowning in tomato sauce with onions; you can't go wrong. Probably the best crunchy-yet-perfectly-cheesy mozzarella sticks. 4/$4 tax in. Veal Sammi was everything you need."}
{"text":"I've been going to California sandwiches for years usually at the Burlington location. I go for the breaded eggplant almost every single time. I stopped by the one in downtown Toronto because I know I'm getting and I was on a time crunch. I'm not sure if it's a new concept but she asked me I wanted hot/spicy/ mild. I went ahead and got the hottest option. She then asked me if I wanted cheese on it? I've been going here for years and not once have I been asked if I wanted to pay extra for cheese. In the literal picture they use to advertise on their menu and everywhere else it's a picture with cheese ouzing out of the exact sandwich I always get.   It's not the fact I have to pay extra it's the fact it's false advertising especially when I've boughten so much out of there franchises. Can someone let me know if that's a thing or of it's new or if the employee wanted to pocket it herself?"}
{"text":"Best veal sandwiches in town! Ask for extra sauce on the side for dipping - it's that good! They've also got jalapeño sauce - spicy but tasty. The olives are also delicious... They're serving up some seriously good sandwiches that are easily big enough to share. This is THE ONLY place we'd ever go for veal sandwiches. Lineups can get long, but it's worth the wait. I have no pictures of the food because we ate it too quickly! Check it out for yourself! Awesome."}
{"text":"If you want a delicious, hearty sandwich look no further. California Sandwiches is the go to for a meaty, comforting meal. I had the sausage and onions with cheese added and it was just what I needed on a Sunday after a long Saturday night. The thing that stood out was the sausage. Well seasoned and very high quality. Will definitely need to return for some other choices like the veal, chicken and steak."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better chicken and veal cutlet sandwiches I have ever had. However, for me to rate 5 stars, I need be absolutely blown away. So the reason I am not rating this restaurant 4 stars is because of the ridiculous amount of time it takes to actually get the sandwich. I understand how busy it gets as I usually visit during the lunch hour. That being said, I am not particularly impressed with the employees lack of urgency. Too many times I have visited where I see the people preping the sandwiches taking their sweet time when there's a lineup to the door. On several occasions I have even seen the sandwich preps in the dining area chatting away with other people or employees. It should not take 20 minutes to assemble one sandwich, especially when all the contents of said sandwich are already cooked and prepared, waiting to be placed between a bun. Overall, I love the food but the wait time is insane. I suggest the food to anyone as long as you visit earlier in the day."}
{"text":"Best chicken and veal sandwiches around.. Come hungry because the portions are huge.. I live for the eggplant parm with cheese sans bun.. so hearty and meaty you don't even miss not having meat.. all the sandwiches are delish.. staff always super friendly, haven't had one bad experience yet"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today (01/07/15) and I found the sandwiches to be WAY more soggy then usual. Also, the cashier, a kinda young heavy lady with long black hair was extremely snobby and rude. I personally don't think I will be coming back to this location because of that rude service and way too much sauce causing the bun to be soggy. Such a shame because I use to love this place and always recommend it to friends and family."}
{"text":"Decent place with tasty sandwiches, but the pricey toppings and obnoxious crowd always make you question a return trip. On top of that, it's debit and cash only so the hassle can definitely be real.   If you're looking for something new to try then definitely check it out, but don't expect a 'wow' or something special that would bring you back.   Also, I don't think these are what traditional California sandwiches are, but then again, I've never been to the west coast."}
{"text":"OMG...great food...Big food....The size of sandwich is Huge...... It is bigger then my head...love veal tomato sauce sandwich with their olives...You got a eat here with olives...."}
{"text":"Delicious, sizable and tasty.   Have I had a better chicken sandwich? Yes, but, this one is pretty damn close.   Price is great too."}
{"text":"The only veal sandwich in the city that uses real veal .and they pan fry it in olive oil on top of the stove like it should be there sauce is unbelievable everything is fresh the best video sandwich in the city of Toronto"}
{"text":"Second favourite location in the city. This location gets extremely busy around lunch time (which is expected).   The veal here is really good. Nice and tender. Cooked just right. The sauce to me is perfect. Little sweet, nice and light.. I could eat the sauce alone with some bread. Delicious.   The chicken breaded cutlet here also delicious. Pair it with some provolone and some peppers. Amazing.   Also try the spicy olives. Great addition to any sandwich."}
{"text":"My favourite panini place in the city. Every time I come here the veal is super tender, it literally melts in my mouth. The bread is always fresh and so are the toppings. Easily your best bang for buck here. Cannot go wrong.   Chicken/Veal panini are both equally as good as one another."}
{"text":"best sausage sandwich, huge portion and lots of flavor  my only compliant is that if you show up later in the shift, they tend to run out"}
{"text":"This is the worst location of this chain. High turn over of staff who usually have no idea what they're doing or selling."}
{"text":"Sandwiches here are out of control.  From looking at the photos, I thought they would be too heavy for me, but they are pure perfection.  I see why this place is so popular... I'm also glad that I followed the advice of other Yelpers and added cheese and mushrooms to my chicken sandwich... really mind-blowing."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch. After 12:30. The restaurant was half occupied and there weren't any line ups.  The menu selection they have to offer is limited and to my standards; quite basic. They offer chicken, veal, ham and veggie options. To be honest, it was only a hand full of different meats with different variations of toppings (not really impressing). I opted for the grilled chicken sandwich on kaiser bun. Which included free toppings of lettuce, tomatoes and BBQ sauce. I added sautéed mushrooms for $1.  The sandwich itself was quite large and filling. But it wasn't quite satisfying. It just felt like a sloppy sandwich with BBQ sauce spilling over. I was hoping that the sandwich would be hot and steaming; but wrong again. Only the grilled chicken was warm and everything else was room temperature. Maybe my high expectations weren't meet that day because how cold it was outside.  The only thing that stood out at this place was the price. Ridiculously over-priced. I paid $12 for a grilled chicken sandwich with sautéed mushrooms and BBQ sauce. I would have expected fries or salad at any other place. I have to admit, it was filling but not satisfying.  And one more thing, it was cold inside. It felt like they didn't care for the heat to be on. The tables weren't clean either, for those that didn't clean up themselves; the tables were littered with crumbs and should have been wiped immediately.  Nothing will bring me back here."}
