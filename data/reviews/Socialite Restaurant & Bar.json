{"text":"My frd and I stumbled upon this place after work, the place just opened and the atmosphere's very warm and cozy. We tried the chicken wings, siders and the sea bass, and they all tasted amazing! I highly recommend the chicken wings! They are moist and fried to perfection! Would definitely come again!!"}

{"text":"Love it here ! I usually won't share anything or hidden gem. But I like their beer choices and food :D"}
{"text":"The interior is so nice and the staffs are friendly. The most important things are the food is fantastic and the pint is cheap! I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome hipster bar!! The food was really good and I love the vibes here... cozy, fun, good music, and it's good they have a small collection of games there in case ur group gets bored and feel like playing a game! Would come back for sure, would like to see the live dj nights. Oh and the co-owner was super cool and friendly!! And gave us free shots. Always awesome PR."}
{"text":"Best place to have a drink and hang out with friends if your not looking for a crazy night out. Foods great, compliments to the brotherhood brothers. There's always good music playing on the weekends with live djs. Staff and service were super friendly and kind. My friends forgot to get a cake for a birthday and the manager went out of his way and got us one last minute. Highly recommend this gem. Will be coming here more once the patios open up."}
{"text":"I came here on Sunday night for the comedy show. It was awesome!! The lineup was really good (it's called the very illegal comedy show). The jerk chicken mac and cheese is also DELICIOUS. Highly recommend this place, it's quite underrated."}
{"text":"My new go to place for snacks in the market. Easy on the eyes wood and metal furnishings bathed in a purple glow. Melt in your mouth delicious and beautiful food and classic cocktails served by friendly people who I wish every success. We had the calamari, bahn mi and sushi burger and all were scrumptious even though I do like a little char on my calamari. We just had beer, next time will try a cocktail. Much lower price point than the former Torito and kitchen open to midnight, though the owner hopes to stay open later if there is an appetite. Both owners and chef came over to welcome us and get our feedback which was over the top service I dont expect but which is savvy for a new spot in a crowded market. Looking forward to popping by and trying more food after we visit Grossmans Tavern or Cloak and Dagger on our next Tuesday night on the town."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good offering a sort of Asian fusion (ie. Beef sushi burrito etc.) blend however what stood out was the service. The owners are both incredibly friendly and I would highly recommend this place to anyone.  Prices are very reasonable and food quality was on par."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere, amazing food, super friendly staff, and cheap drinks. Highly recommended! The fried cheese appetizer is a must!"}
{"text":"Been there once with friends for drinks. It's a very cozy place for fun. So many different groups of ppl dancing. The music is decent. Very good vibe for drinks and dance."}
{"text":"Staff weren't exactly welcoming, 3 girls stood around an empty bar not greeting staff. Also to make a whisky sour actually sour the ingredient to use is lemon not lime."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I came here a few weeks ago after work for some drinks and food. Atmosphere was nice and comfortable. We ordered the nachos with seaweed salad as we thought it was a neat concept. Our food came and looked pretty appetizing. The nachos themselves tasted great, but as I was eating, I kept on biting into these dark brown, hard, dry and rubber-y nuggets. I couldn't pinpoint what it was until it kicked in that it was ground beef. 

That same night, I began to feel terribly sick. The next day, my co-worker and I had to call in sick for food poisoning."}
{"text":"I was in the area when I stumbled upon this dime of an eatery and I must say it was a fantastic experience. 

I found out it's also new in the area, so it stood out pretty nicely. I had a light lunch with a beer. The tuna tartare was made very nicely, and they offered something I've never seen with the dish before, thinly sliced deep fried taro. Soooo good. I followed that up with the only pasta they had and that was So juicy... Great ingredients made it a dynamic experience and I must say the decor inside makes it pretty cool.

I highly recommend this place, definitely going to come back with my friends."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite spots to grab a bite in the city. The brotherhood kitchen consistently churns out the best bites, and the menu is always changing. Such good value too. Recently had the lobster Mac & Cheese which was unreal 

Go, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday, otherwise we never would have heard of this place. It's a small bar which serves Asian-fusion food. We ordered a few appetizers that night - chicken wings, nachos, pork belly bao, and calamari. 

First, the calamari was not what we expected. It was pretty much three of those scoops tortilla chips filled with some greens and a piece of calamari on top. Not what we expected at all, although to be honest we didn't read the description in the menu. Would not recommend. The nachos were our favourite. Large, shareable and had seaweed salad in it which gave it a unique taste but wonderfully delicious. The pork belly bao was also really good. It took the longest to come out but was worth the wait. We ordered the chicken wings due to previous reviews on here but honestly, I was not a fan of them. Something just tasted off. It's really dark in this bar as well so we didn't bother to photograph the food. Reading the menu was also a challenge.

There was a live DJ that night we went so music was loud in this small place. Vibe was great though, and the servers were very friendly and approachable. There's another venue going on downstairs. Washrooms are located on the lower level and it was not well stocked (no TP!) 

Busy place in Kensington. We don't head out to this area too often but would come back if in the area and meeting friends. The friendly service and nachos make it worthwhile. (3.5)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend we're in the area for dinner and stumbled upon this gem! Super kool chill atmosphere, great decor, super friendly and fast service I was was super impressed! My girl had some wine and I had a pint of Wellington SPA very tasty!!

We ordered a few apps I had the wings which we're delicious came with a couple of tasty dipping sauces on the side. But my girlfriend ordered this calamari app that was off the off the chain so tender and the lil flake they put it on was a perfect combination!

On to the entrees, I ordered the steak cooked medium it was so juicy and tender really cooked to my liken it also came with this amazing salad I had to order it on the side but well worth it! My girl had the lamb chops with rice she loved it and I even nibbled some lamb and was like yum! She ended up mixing the rice with the stew like saucethat had bits of lamb in it and went to town lol.

All in all such a positive vibe and pleasant experience! Friendly staff, great service and even better food and drinks made me fall in love with this spot! We will definitely be returning here sooner than later!!!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night and as soon as we walked in the place smelled like a public restroom. The place was also not busy at all (there were 2 other tables) No one greeted us, and we sat our selves at a table. There were 3 servers/ bartenders and not one of them came to our table to greet us. After sitting for 5 minutes I got up and walked over to the bar to ask for a drink menu. After that a server came by and dropped off some water. about 5 minutes later we were ready to order and for 15 minutes no one came by our table to take an order. It would be understandable if the place was busy but it wasn't! When someone finally came to our table they took our drink orders (1 sex on the beach, 1 royal fizz, and 1 somersby cider) within 5 minutes the drinks came out expect for mine which was the cider. After about another 10 minutes still nothing. Again, if it was busy it would be understandable, if I had ordered an elaborate drink it would be understandable however, 15 minutes to bring a can of cider to a table in an almost empty bar is UNACCEPTABLE. The only reason I'm giving this place any stars at all is because the decor and atmosphere was interesting and prices weren't too bad."}
