{"text":"First time we ate at a B Spot restaurant.  I Ordered a thin lizzy and my wife got a plain jane. Both burgers were very salty and overcooked.  The fries were ok, but we're a bit weak on flavor.  Overall, I wouldn't seek out this restaurant on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Don't let this burger experience tarnish your view of B Spot, especially if you've never had B Spot before. Their Crocker Park location is where it's at for price and quality. At the Q all burgers are medium well. This is fine given how busy they are, but I wouldn't mind waiting for a quality B Spot burger and not the sub par fast food experience at the Q. If you can't deliver a consistent product then don't bother. I will say that getting a B Spot burger before a game is better than a hot dog or nachos but is still a poor representation of a Michael Symon restaurant."}
{"text":"Every time I go to see the Cavs play I take the time to enjoy one of the B Spot burgers. Usually there is a line during the game or at half time, so try to arrive early so you can get one of these delicious burgers before the game starts. Priced at $9.75, these burgers weigh in at an estimated one-third pound. Don't try to be fancy and come up with your own creation, there's no time. Just order from the posted limited menu and trust in Michael Symon. He knows what he is doing. Dollar for dollar it is the best value at the Q.

It comes, thick and juicy and perfectly cooked, served in wax paper on a cardboard tray so you can take it back to your seat. A separate condiment dispenser lets you load up on anything else you might want to take. But be careful. You don't want to overwhelm that delicious burger. It's as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Counter service only does not a restaurant make. While I expect to pay more at such a venue, $17 for two milkshakes was outrageous as my $10 chocolate with kalua added was half the size of the $7 strawberry shake we got. It wasn't mixed in but rather say at the bottom - do yourself a favor and skip this location."}
{"text":"We have eaten at the B Spot at the Q 3 times previous to this review. I don't remember it being bad any of those times but last night was horrible. I realize that this is a cattle feed place and service is paramount and the service was very quick last night but almost certainly at the expense of serving decent food. I paid $19 for two gristle filled cheeseburgers that tasted like salt and were far worse than eating a Whopper Jr or a Wendy's Jr Cheeseburger Deluxe. I lost my receipt and had to get to my seat or I would have approached the manager. My fault. We have always enjoyed the other B Spots around Cleveland but I question if we will return when they feel entitled to print money while serving garbage at the Q. I wonder what Michael Symon would say if I charged him $9.50 and served him what he served me. Knowing his personality he would have a fit. Avoid and spread the word."}
{"text":"All these reviews on food quality make me \"lulz\" inside because... come on. It's a sports center, not Restaurant Row! Hopefully you're here to enjoy whatever event you actually have a ticket for, with overpriced grub an optional add-on to the experience. 

But seriously, B Spot at the Q, I 'preciate you. Why? Because when the lines for all the normal stands were 10 people deep and I was regretting not ordering one more margarita on E. 4th for the same price that a plastic cup of beer was here, you were there corralling empty space between the retractable belts. And. AND. Selling $10 alcohol-spiked milkshakes. YOU DA REAL MVP. Just make sure you listen for your order number.

I admit that I have not tried an actual burger here, but I imagine they're more than passable. I do feel qualified to comment comment that their onion rings are just the greasy, sodium-packed goodness you want to balance out some ice cream. Make sure you grab some napkins before you leave the food court - or a friend's t-shirt."}
{"text":"For a stadium arena Burger, the more bites I took the more I began to accept the cost and if I had a Burger such as this in some of the other stadiums I've been in, I would be quite satisfied.  Not a must eat stop in the city, but if you happen to have an extra $10 hanging out of your socks, it'll be a tasty treat.  

Btw, it's quite difficult to locate Iron Chef {Michael Symon} owned restaurants in Sports Stadiums around the world, so sometimes you just have to appreciate what you have you lucky Cavs fans.  The low point was the $4.75 Lola Fries, I wish they had normal fries for a quarter of the price.  Taste wise I didn't pick up any exotic addictive flavours compared to other fries I've tasted, it must have been the salt overload.

There were a lot, a lot of employees behind the counters and I noticed that some of them were a bit confused which lead to potential extended wait time especially if you order anything non-standard items or required specific toppings added/removed, so if you're in a bit of a rush then it's best not to read too far into the menu."}
{"text":"Yuk! Definitely low quality, greasy with lots of salt added. Not worth all the hype."}
{"text":"As far as burgers at The Q go, this is your spot for the tastiest ones. However, having never actually been to a B Spot before and this being my first experience--it was just A-OK. 

I ordered the bacon cheddar burger with nothing else on it, added pickles and salted the bun. And you better believe I got a side of Lola fries. It was served up quickly and I had a nice tequila buzz going, so I appreciated the swiftness. The pickles were thick-sliced and crunchy, the burger bun was buttered and the burger was a mid-well patty. I thought the salt on the bun was necessary, since the patty seemed a tad under-seasoned for my taste. But overall, it was a good burger. The best you'll find at The Q, but hardly the best outside of that arena. The fries were delicious and crunchy with just a hint of rosemary and garlic. Pretty darn close to the fries I've had at Lolita. I wish they had been hotter when we got them, but remember--you're at a sports arena. We also got up to grab food near the end of the 2nd quarter of the Cavs game to avoid the halftime rush. I bet you if we would have waited those fries would have been pipping hot."}
{"text":"When you are at the Q, this is a great option for burgers and sandwiches before the game.  There is always a line, unless you arrive when the doors to the Q open.  Basic menus of burgers, chicken and brats.  All of them are prepared beautifully.  There are fried onion rings, but you should not miss Lola fries.  Once you start eating them, you simply cannot stop!  Small selection of soft drinks, water and beer as well.  Seating is a premium as well."}
{"text":"I have low expectation of fast food at Sport Event as most of them are overpriced for mediocre food. But B Spot really exceeded my expectation.

4 Star for their burgers at around $10, probably the best deal at The Q. Freshly made and so tasty. And you can top it up with as much or as little condiments at the station was a plus.

Lola Fries ($4.75) was a little disappointing over seasoned non crispy matchstick fries. I would suggest just order another burger :).

Drinks pricing same as every single vendor inside the Stadium. $4.25 for a bottle of water?! Soda for $4.75... Beer for $8.25 and up. Just painfully expensive! 

Just eat another burger.."}
