{"text":"I wanted this to be good. Greasy spoons are good and hole in the walls are good, so there was and is potential.  You order at the counter and they bring it to you.  Pancakes super saturated in grease and butter, bad if you don't butter your pancakes, worse if you are like normal folks and do use butter, because the cakes are saturated in grease and burnt on edges.  French toast pieces are three halves not four, plus bread so thin it was saturated with egg, grease and not good.  Meats tasted like same grease.  Scary,  uou will smell differently when you leave.  Cheap is not always good but when it is you have hit a gold mine. This place messes up breakfast and that should never happen!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place while in Gastonia for an indoor soccer game.   Loved it!  Get the street tacos and chips and queso. Kids had chicken tenders with fries and philly steak sandwich and enjoyed it.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This spot has been several different restaurants under several different owners for the past few years, but I think they've got the formula right this time. The daily specials look interesting ranging from meatloaf to taco Tuesday. I got a chicken burrito it that comes with a side of chips and salsa. The burrito was excellent with lots of meat and beans and just spicy enough. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is amazing and very reasonably priced.  The staff was very atentative and polite.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Stop in last Friday.  Got the streets Tacos. Very tasty. This place has just changed owner and new menu.  Very good and clean."}
{"text":"I had heard great things so we went Saturday for lunch. OMG! This place is awesome! The burgers were outstanding. Fries were too. 
If I had one complaint it would be the hours. Closing at 3:00 pm means I can only eat here on weekends. Bummer. But give it a try for lunch. You'll thank me!"}
