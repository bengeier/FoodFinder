{"text":"Family run business run by really nice people serving great gryos.  Marlene recommended a fantastic dinner for the two of us. We are dedicatedly going back.  Try the Greek fries.  Not something I would normally consider, but the fries were crispy and covered with feta."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Best gyro I have had to date! The lamb/beef was cooked perfectly - well done while still being tender with that delightful savory melt-in-your-mouth sensation. The tzatziki was incredible. It tasted fresh and flavorful, and it didn't seem like it was put together as an afterthought.  The pita bread was fresh and soft, and held everything together nicely. Also, even though I am not normally a fan of chunky fries, I found the wedge fries served with the dish to be phenomenal. The staff was also very friendly and accommodating. Overall, it was a wonderful experience, and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Looking for a gyro? Don't go anywhere else. You get great customer service and great food. Get the greek fries. You won't regret anything you order, unless you didnt order the greek fries...."}
{"text":"Great people,  great food. Stop in and you won't be disappointed. Had the gyro and spinach pie and almost died from the flavor explosion! You can smoke a hookuh and byob,  and belly dancers on most Saturdays."}
{"text":"Beautiful clean restaurant.  Welcoming staff, plenty of variety on the menu, excellent food and very reasonable prices.  I will definitely go there again"}
{"text":"Oh have mercy. Every time I am in Phoenix I NEED to go to the Gyro House. No menu required... I just order the lamb gyro. It comes with a basket of thick, hot fries that I continue to burn my tongue on. I never learn. The gyro is flavorful with just the right amount of yogurt sauce and red onions. The lamb is cooked until it's a little crunchy and the pita is always soft and chewy. Mmm. The place itself isn't that charming, but the family who runs the place is very nice. I am glad to give them my business!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic food,super friendly staff and fast service! Was craving Greek food for takeout and found this charming spot. Gotta love a place where they make you feel welcome and get your order right all at the same time. Have been back a few times for lunch and look forward to bringing the family for dinner, cute outdoor patio in addition to main dining room. I'm a sucker for feta, fresh gyros and outdoor dining."}
{"text":"Always friendly here at Gyro House! Nice to have an option for Greek food in my area. Never had a bad mean here. Try the Greek fries!"}
{"text":"The gyro was okay.  The hummus tasted store-bought and the baklava which was supposedly made by Grandma was disgusting."}
{"text":"After reading all of the amazing reviews, I was excited to go have a Gyro. Well, to my surprise lamb is not an option. What?Mozzarella sticks appetizer... Really?  To me this restaurant is another sad example of the lack of competition, and the overall acceptance of mediocrity in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Greek salad with the Gyro meat was Delish! The beef was a little dry and the hummus wasn't great though"}
{"text":"I loooove their gyro! I usually order for take out a gyro combo which comes with fries but I substitute it with greek salad for a small fee which is also sooo delicious! The ladies were nice and they have been in this location for over 10 years. I can't wait to come here on a Friday where they have belly dancing and hopefully try something else too. I'm sure it will be delish!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. Owned by locals, and everything tasted wonderful. Affordable too. $7 gyros that come with fries or another side which definitely filled me up. I ordered a chicken gyro and my father ordered a regular beef/lamb gyro. We both loved them- best gyros we've had yet, especially for the price. We ordered baklava as well, which not only was presented beautifully with drizzled chocolate but also tasted great. And for the price, we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Good food and great service, but couldn't give it a 5 stars because they don't serve lamb. Not sure what they put in the rice, didn't know rice could taste that good."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Really nice customer service, and the food tastes really fresh. Would eat here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"The best gyro my mom and I have ever had! The meat is moist and flavorful.  Owners friendly.  This is a must try! Will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place after walking by it many times (after leaving YouFit next door). I'm sorry I didn't try it sooner! Had the chicken shawarma with side greek salad. Excellent and super inexpensive. Nothing fancy about this place. Just good food and good prices. Friendly staff. Try it out. I'm going to go back and try the rest of their menu out!"}
{"text":"Love the family owned business especially in our unique area. I would by no means call this area ghetto or seedy as some previous reviewers had. The area has survived the test of time, may need a little update but still has the same upper class, down to earth people like the owners of this restaurant. They keep it real and appreciate their clients and not try to keep up with the Jones to the east of us. The food is excellent but make sure your not heading out on a date later because the garlic has the gift that keeps on giving. My favorite is the falafel, fresh and not greasy."}
{"text":"Had some high hopes going into this place given the ratings on Yelp. There isn't much for ambiance which I can get past as I came for the food. The service was good and friendly as I never waited for a refill or anything. The food, it was just okay.   I had the gyro with greek fries and my wife had the hummus plate with chicken. They both were just kind of average. The hummus didn't have a lot of flavor, but the portion and amount of chicken was pretty good. The gyro was good, but the taiko was kind of bland."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I had a gyro and baba ganoush. It was the tenderest and perfectly flavored meat i have had in a gyro. The sauce was perfect with a hint of dill and the salad with feta and olives was a great compliment to the meal.   The owner is very personable and was chatting with us for several minutes and seemed to have a unique relationship with every costumer that came in.   I would eat here everyday if I could.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Just drove to the Gyro place and it is closed and looks like it is up for sale, so bummed.  Anyone know why it closed?"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best gyro in town!! I've never had one so delicious and genuine! The salads are good too!  It's a hidden gem and I'm so glad we found this place to make it regular spot we can visit! If you're a fan of the gyro, make a trip to this place.  You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Nice little place, very friendly staff. Had the beef/lamb gyro and it was excellent! Would absolutely eat there again!"}
{"text":"The Gyro House was a fantastic night out. Upon entering we were greeted by a belly dancer and live Middle Eastern music. It was very clear this was a local favorite - run by family. If you have a hankering for hummus, grape leaves or of course, gyros - this is your stop! Top it off with cream tea and freshly made cinnamon dessert - heaven! This house is full of a welcoming staff ready to fill your belly! Don't forget to byob!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in the last week for lunch since I'm working nearby. Had the regular gyro and chicken schwarma (spelling?) and both were really great. This is how a gyro should taste in my opinion.   Don't be fooled by the meager exterior, this is a charming place with great food that is priced just right."}
{"text":"The family is so awesome. The food is amazing. The service is top notch.  Very family friendly. We have three little ones that wok eat anything on the menu"}
{"text":"Once again, I found myself in an area that I was unfamiliar of what there is to eat.  I pulled out my yelp and looked up \"greek restaurants\" nearby.  Gyro House popped up and had good marks.  I ordered the greek salad with gyro meat and it cost me about $9.00. My order came out in good time and it was PACKED with gyro meat. Good flavor and filling. I could have used more pepperconi and tomato but no biggie it was still done well. I probably won't find myself this far north Phoenix again, BUT if I do- I would certainly visit Gyro House."}
{"text":"Can't believe the high ratings for this s**thole.  Food is passable.  Restaurant is beyond filthy.  Arms stick to the tables because they're never cleaned.  Witnessed a drug deal go down, with the staff while waiting for my order."}
{"text":"We found these folks by accident and have been going back on a very regular basis.  We love that it is run by a family and they have phenomenal service.  I have tried all of the specials and never been disappointed.  On friday nights now, they have belly dancers and other entertainment.    If you live in that area, you owe it to yourself and your tummy to give them a try!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Gyros Much better and less expensive than the gyro restaurant on Shea & Scottsdale"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place and luckily it's really close to home.  They have the best gyros and the fries are amazing.  This is typically our lunch on Saturday.  Yummy"}
{"text":"Yum! Good Mediterranean food and family run. Always friendly and fast and it's nice to support small neighborhood business."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. There was a change of ownership and if I had to review in one word, it would be:  GREASE  all the food was too greasy. The string beans side was swimming in oil. The beef in the shwarma was tough and chewy. The gyro was much better but it was still too greasy. The baba ganoush was so bad we threw it out, having hardly eaten any of it. Disappointing, won't go back.  2ND VISIT  I lied. We went back. A sequel so lame you could call it Grease 2. GREASE. SWIMMING IN GREASE. Gross.  Also the baba ganoush is stringy. I've never had it stringy anywhere else. Maybe somewhere in the world they make it that way, who knows. Don't like it that way. We had baba ganoush last night at Pita Jungle and it is sooooo good and it's not stringy."}
{"text":"The food here was actually pretty good. Went to check it out for another time today and it appears they are closed. It does look like a new Burger place (Aioli Burger) is going to open up shop. Would be great to get a quality restaurant in this location as it is what this area has been missing for a while. Excited to see what happens with Aioli.."}
{"text":"The best middle eastern food in AZ . I loved there gyro and falafel . I will love to come over here every time I come to AZ. The owner is amazing cool guy ."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago, so growing up in a big city where restaurants have to be above average and stay very competitive in order to stay open, I am used to expecting above average food and service when I eat out. Plus, I'm also an excellent cook myself. So, if I know I can make it better myself, I'm not impressed.  That being said, I was pleasantly surprised with this place.   Location: conveniently located in the NW corner of Shea & 32nd St (in the strip mall). Within a couple miles from where I live.   Atmosphere: family-owned medium sized hole in the wall, but comfortable. No bright, harsh halogen lights, like in most other fast food gyro joints.   Staff: the lady at the counter was very friendly and helpful. She was also our server.   Service: was fast.   Food: fresh and delicious gyros.  The fries my boyfriend ordered with his chicken gyro, were hot & fresh. Not greasy or soggy (like some places).  My beef/lamb gyro was very good. While I've had some of the best gyros back in Chicago, this one was very good too. Meat was hot and fresh. The pita bread was warm, soft and fluffy- two thumbs up.  I was also happy and relieved to learn they had options, to choose something else other than just fries. I choose the Greek salad with my Gyro. Thank God! I'm glad I didn't leave there thinking I had overloaded on carbs and calories.   Will definitely recommend this place. And will return again.   Makes me wonder what the heck was wrong with some of the people who gave negative reviews..? Maybe THEY were the problem. Especially, that inconsiderate broad with the bratty kid. The nerve of some people to not know how to handle their own kids in public, but expect everyone else to tolerate that behavior, while they try to enjoy their meal. The restaurant staff shouldn't have to watch YOUR kid for you either. Get a grip! Stay at home, until you learn to control your brat. And, maybe learn some manners yourself. You rude ass, condescending idiot!"}
{"text":"Had the Gyro, was thrown for a loop when she asked me if I wanted sour cream or cucumber sauce but the finished product was great"}
{"text":"Come for the gyro and don't forget the handmade pierogies!! I was in love with the thought of a great not frozen piece of tasteless meat gyro and I fell even more in love with the pierogie dinner!"}
{"text":"Awesome little place been there a few times never a bad meal food is great and fair priced made to order"}
{"text":"disgusting! The cook dropped gyros meat on the floor while pepairing my plate. he quickly glanced over in my direction and it appeared as if I was looking down at my phone. He picked up the meat, placed it on the counter and took another look in my direction, he then quickly placed it on my plate and served it up. I looked down at my phone again and searched for the health department hotline..."}
{"text":"Best Gyro I have ever had. So good on many levels. Been here twice in a week. Meat is tasty and the bread is so soft. The fries and onion rings are good too. I have ate at the restaurant and ordered to go. Both are good options. They have a bunch of high chairs but I have not seen any kids using them. I got my Gyro and fries for $7.50 which is good. This place is not fancy but has really good food."}
{"text":"My husband and I just ate at this restaurant tonight and it was delicious.  We got hummus for an appetizer and each had the gyro sandwich. He got his with steak fries and I got a side salad. Everything was great. The side salad was exceptional.   The restaurant is located in a shopping center. The decor is dated, however, it's not quite a dive. The location and decor are the only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars. But the food and owners are great. I will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Nor much to look at on the outside, and minimalist on the inside as well. The menu was extensive and what I saw all looked appetizing. I ordered the signature item, the gyro, which was very good. Don't judge this place bio the outside, the food is good."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. I used to work in a \"Greek\" restaurant down the road (Tatum & Shea) and this place is actually REAL authentic Greek food cooked by GREEK people. The taste is HANDS DOWN by far amazing in comparison. You can tell the difference. I will never be able to eat knock off Greek food again."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not great. Would go again because it's so close to home.   Outdoor patio area very basic no frills."}
{"text":"The food is tastey and affordable. The atmosphere is friendly. I promise you will be satisfied. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"Awesome gyros! A hidden gym in the back corner of a strip mall but definitely worth the trip! Always fast, friendly, and tasty! A staple when I need a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The Greek fries are not to be missed.  The staff is always friendly and attentive.  Try it and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is my kind of place; a really great dive. First off, the owners are extremely friendly. I wanted to try a falafel and I didn't want to purchase the entire platter. I got hooked up.  The babaganoush is the real deal. The Gyro's have a ton of flavor. The prices are dirt cheap. I dig the Gyro House!"}
{"text":"I have never been a huge fan of Mediterranean food, but I am officially converted!!   Let me start by saying the Gyro house has the best chicken gyro I've ever had!I would definitely agree with the other reviewers that aesthetically, this place is not something to look at. It's located in a small strip mall and the restaurant itself is not the fanciest. However, it definitely has character. It looks like your run-of-the-mill small, local business. The owner was in the store when I went in, and he was super friendly and I received great customer service.  Now for the good part... the food! I ordered a chicken gyro with french fries. Both were delish! The chicken was very tender and was served on the fluffiest pita bread I've ever tasted. It was topped with lettuce, tomato, red onion (which I picked off), and tzaziki sauce. I paid about $7.50 for my meal, and it was definitely worth every penny. If you're a fan of a great gyro, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Best Gyros in town! I used to work right in the area and always wanted to try this place and man am I glad I did! They're Gyros are perfect! The price is great too! for $5 you get a Gyro and french fries. Not bad in my opinion. You can opt for a larger size Gyro and pay a little extra for those of you who need a bigger one, but for me the regular size was just right. It had the right amount of meat and the sauce was perfect! I had a Gyro salad one time too and I took out the pita cause I was trying to avoid met and it was an AMAZING salad!"}
{"text":"Think Middle East meets CHEERS...  Every time I walk into the Gyro House I hear my name from the owner.  These people go out of their way to make you feel welcome and that is one of the reasons I go back.  The other is the food - listen to me now and believe me later... this is GREAT Mediterranean chow.  The location is right off the 51 and Shea and easy to get to from anywhere in north Phoenix.  Sits in an older center but that gives it charm.  If you've ever lived in the Middle East (I have) you know that American restaurant decor is not the norm.  I like the atmosphere, it makes it different than Olive Garden!  The rice, the salad and the MEAT is top notch.  Always well prepared and plentiful portions.  I share a plate or walk out with my next meal in a box.  Try the kabob - excellent.  If you are ever jonesing for french fries come here first.  Ever since Wendy's changed their fries these are the BEST.  My favorite restaurant in the Middle East was in back of a BP Petrol Station.  Gyro House is nicer and closer.  Try it.  You'll like it."}
{"text":"Fresh, home made and delicious. One of the best Mediterranean restaurants I have ever visited. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Like the others reviews - not much in the way of decor.  The food is great!  Staff is always pleasant.  The chicken Gyro is very tasty!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant after reading the Yelp reviews to see if it was as good as everybody said. I ordered the Gyro and Hummous with cucumbers. The Gyro meat was the best I have ever had anywhere in the valley, not the stringy little strips of meat that you get elsewhere, but big hunks of flavorful tender meat in a fresh, fragrant Pita.  The hummous was homemade and had a very unique flavor with a drizzle of olive oil over the top. I dipped the crisp cucumbers in the hummous and that alone was worth the trip!!  Everything is  fresh and homemade.  The owner is at the counter taking orders and it seemed like she knew everybody by name when they came in. What a rarity in this city!!  I will be back soon, probably tomorrow!!!  Highly recommend!!  Also the homemade Baklava looked delicious and it will be in my ToGo bag soon!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving some gyro the other night and wanted to order some takeout and just hangout at home. I ordered the gyro plate and he ordered the gyro pita with fries. We will definitely be coming back for more takeout! I also ordered a baklava roll because it striked my curiosity... I've never seen baklava in a roll before. My boyfriend is half Greek and he gave this place a thumbs up! He also likes the steak fries and how the gyro meat is sliced.   The location is tucked away in a corner on the NW corner or Shea and 32nd St. It seems to be a mom and pop shop and I asked how long they have been in business - 9 years! ...and I'm just now trying this place out. It's a very quiet place and there weren't many customers when we got there but definitely a decent place."}
{"text":"Ate here on Saturday for lunch.  My wife and I loved it.  Great food.  Great service.  Good prices. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love mom and pop business but this one really takes the cake .. I nearly always get a gyro and Greek fries , it's inexpensive , fresh and the service and personable family who run it can't be matched in the valley .. Everything is made to order and some of the entrees I have had are just phenomenal .. I give this place 5 stars for the food and service alone .. Also they have BYOB and there is a little liquor store a few doors down that has a deal to give a discount to patrons ... Friday nights they have belly dancing and they also have hookah .."}
{"text":"So, I live near to the Gyro House. That being said, I love this place, the staff is friendly, everyone remembers the regulars, and it should get more exposure. The food is very good and really the owners add the little touch of care that I appreciate a lot. Every time I come I am stepping into a place where I am recognized and appreciated. It is a pleasant departure. It is small, the food is good, it is what you need."}
{"text":"A must do if you're in town. Gyros are fantastic. Love the baklava. Super cheap prices. The ambience could use a little work but that's not what I come here for ;)"}
{"text":"Great quality, great taste and fair prices. The gyro fries are fantastic. Family friendly and the ladies who work at the counter are super nice. They do have highchairs but no changing station in the bathroom. Otherwise I'd give them five stars."}
{"text":"Small business own and run by a respectful family. Healthy, fresh, homemade style and inexpensive cuisine! Their gyros are our favorite in town!"}
{"text":"It's a lot to say but I this place had the best gyro I've ever had.  I guess that makes the name appropriate.  I had the traditional gyro with the side salad substitution and not only was the pita soft, warm, with just a slight crunch, but the meat inside was perfectly cooked, seasoned, and with nice big chunks (though still tender).  Even the side salad was good, with lots of feta and taste, instead of the typical side greek salad you get at most places that looks like it was thrown together in 30 seconds and maybe came out of a bag.  Definitely recommend this place and will be hitting it again.  P.S. The baklava they have is HUGE!  It's bigger than a rolled taco, instead of the tiny slices you get elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have to say, growing up in Europe I am always hopefully to find a good Gyros here in the Valley. This location is next to my job and I decided to give it a shot even though it's in one of the standardized strip malls we have here in Phoenix. The place doesn't draw crowds I have to say, but when I went the restaurant owners and their family were sitting down for lunch and it was a scene straight out of a movie. That alone did it for me. I think they could do with a better location, but my reviews are always a combination of the atmosphere of a place and its food. The food I've had here is great but I just wish I wasn't always eating there alone. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area and in the mood for some Greek food."}
{"text":"This is a humble Mediterranean restaurant. The owner is friendly and service is great. It's like home made Mediterranean food serviced in someone's living room. The decor needs some help, gyro is a bit on the salty side but overall fresh food. This is a regular spot for my family when we are craving for gyros. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Awesome people and amazing food! Always fresh and delicious! I am from California and always make sure to stop out here when I come to visit! Definitely recommend! Hookah is great as well!"}
{"text":"Closed. The plaza landlord keeps raising the rent and forcing the independent businesses out."}
{"text":"I can only agree with the other reviewers. It is a family owned/run neighborhood restaurant on the NW corner of 32nd and Shea. The restaurant is very clean, very friendly, with outdoor seating when the weather is nice.  I've only ever ordered 3 items. The gyro, humus, and, my favorite, beef shawarma. It comes with a great geek salad and yellow rice. Looking at the other reviews I think I'm going to try the Greek fries. I had never eaten in a middle eastern restaurant before and now it's a neighborhood favorite."}
{"text":"I had lunch here after a hike and was really pleased with how tasty the gyro sandwich was.  The pita bread was fluffy and seemed like it had just come out of the oven - warm and fresh.  The gyro meat was also fresh and delicious.  I was just struck at how good it was for a strip center gyro place.    Give this place a try and I think you will like it, too!"}
{"text":"Lets get the positives out of the way first. Okay now that we have covered that, lets move on to what is wrong with this place.   Oh Yelpers you did me wrong on this one. Of course they might have been having an off day but I will never know.   I want to be very clear that in no way did the black hair in my tzatziki sauce effect my rating of this restaurant, as a matter of fact it was the attitude of the employees about the hair that didn't do them any favors. I realize that humans (most) have hair and from time to time one wanders into food, and that is a part of life. Not worth getting hot and bothered about in my mind. But when I show it to you and you show it to the cook, then proceed to dish up another dish of it (all the while talking in your native tongue so I have no idea what you are saying) and simply hand it to me with a \"there you go.\" ??? Really? No \"sorry about that\" even? No good kids.   Okay there were some good things, the prepubescent version of the tzatziki sauce was one of the best I have ever had, and the rice was cooked to perfection. However comma what I was served was not what I had envisioned from past experience, what I was served was chicken soy sauce stir-fry with onions, A Greek salad that was reasonably fresh but soaked in vinegar dressing.   And the final nail in the coffin were the mini wedges of dried out stale pita bread. What I am I supposed to do with this? How about a freshly warmed whole pita or flat bread so I can put the ingredients inside like a wrap? It was like trying to pile meat, rice, sauce and lettuce onto a really thick corn  chip.   I recommend taking a pass on this place, or if you feel if you do, don't get the \"shawarma\" plate.   BTW, this is how Shawarma meat should be cooked. http://www.sanobar.com.sg/images/shawarma-org.jpg   Notice no goopy reduced soy sauce mess? Blechk!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here on the way home from soccer practice for dinner take out last night after reading Yelp reviews. The prices were reasonable and the menu offered your traditional Mediterranean dishes. The owner greeted me, took my order, and was very friendly to my family.   Everyone really enjoyed each meal and my daughter raved about the gyro. I had the Greek salad, which was excellent-- especially the tzatziki sauce on the side. I will recommend getting the dressing on the side though as it seems to come with a lot.   My husband has the chicken shawarma plate, which wasn't like what we get in other Greek establishments, but he really enjoyed it. It had a little Middle Eastern flare to it.   We also ordered baba ganoush with warm pita, which was wonderful. This is definitely going on our list of places to revisit."}
{"text":"Awful... not even mediocre. I am giving them one star out of sheer awe that they have managed to stay open this long.  I am shocked at the positive reviews and can only surmise that the owners have lots of family and friends or there are a lot of folks in this area who just don't know any better."}
{"text":"I do like this place, however, it can get expensive if you don't pay attention to what you're getting. But I love their rice and vegetables. The gyro meat is usually good, but this time was sooooo salty we couldn't finish it! They were out of the beef shwarma, but the chicken shwarma was good instead.  Overall, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"We would give this place 6 stars if we could! This place is nothing to look at from the outside; in fact, we probably never would have stopped there if I hadn't read some reviews. This place is phenomenal, it's family owned and run, the owner is always working and friendly. They have the best gyros in Phoenix (and we have tried a lot!) and their hummus is made fresh daily and amazing! We always get top notch service when we go in there and they have fun little trivia booklets to keep you occupied while you wait. The gyro house is definitely a favorite!!"}
{"text":"The owner is super nice and goes  the extra mile to serve. Food is seasoned to perfection and taste great. Kabobs, Gyros, Lamb, Fish he has it all. Oh, all dishes come with rice, salad and pita bread.Very casual. Drop by and spend a few extra bucks for really good food. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.   The Greek Cheese friends - to die for.  The cinnamon apple tea - to double die for.  The Shawarma - the most amazing thing out of everything.  This place will become a new regular stop for us!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant is a diamond hidden in the Arizona desert. You might never know of it unless a friend recommended it because it is set far back in a plaza on Shea. I have been eating there for about 5 years (probably 2-3 times a year) and they have hands-down the BEST gyros in town. Also, I would die for their french fries and tzatziki sauce. I always do take out because I am a bit of a germophobe. It's dark and a little outdated, and the cleanliness level is meh, but I am willing to overlook that because it's delicious. Don't judge the food by the front of the building, just try it and you'll want to eat there for the next few days!"}
{"text":"Have you ever wanted to visit a Greek family for a traditional home cooked Greek dinner... go to Gyro House. It's not fine dining or fresh seafood flown in from the Greek Isles but it is nice people who cook with flavor.  Homemade deserts, wonderful humus plates and salads (ask them to go easy on the dressing if don't like a lot) and Gryos as good as I have had anywhere... including Greek neighborhoods in NYC and West LA..  Oh and ask for the soft fluffy Gyro bread instead of the pita bread with your humus."}
{"text":"The menu from the Gyro House is a staple around our house. If we lack the energy to make dinner at the end of a long day, chances are we're calling in an order. I've been telling myself that I would get on here and promote this place for ages.  These small mom/pop restaurants where pride is still taken in the food are exactly what most neighborhoods lack. The owner is friendly and energetic and is quick to get your order in with the kitchen. I typically order the large salad topped with gyro meat which comes with pita bread...I wish I stopped there. This place serves some mean steak fries for cheap and I struggle to say no when they offer them up.   If you're in the area and you're not picky about decor for your dining experience...try this place out!  Great food, family run, and pretty darn speedy!"}
{"text":"They closed! Well, the joint is packed up and the lights are out! Not sure what happened but don't come here lookin for delicious gyros!"}
{"text":"Been to the Gyro House many times, and have not been disappointed.  Gyro's are great and blows My Fat Greek out of the water."}
{"text":"Passing through Ohio and decided to stop here for dinner. Gyro platter was sooooo good. My 4 year old even said it was the best chicken noodle soup ever. My husband who doesn't like coleslaw actually ate theirs and loved it! Staff was very friendly. Will definitely stop in again if ever in the area."}
{"text":"Great place to have near home when a gyros craving hits. The food is always good, if not great, and prices are very reasonable, We've had just about everything on the menu and havnt found a thing we didnt like. I wish they still did the cabbage roll specials, best I ever had."}
{"text":"Has to be one of the best Greek salads I've ever had! The chicken was perfect--juicy and tender, not overcooked like many other Mediterranean places.   The employees were very pleasant and accommodating to all customers."}
{"text":"Hummus is super creamy and tasty!  Enjoyed falafel and grape leaves. Greek salad, rice and gyro plate were well made and full of flavor.   Appreciated the 10% off available at check in today!"}
{"text":"Great family run Mediterranean place. New complex owners won't let them do hookah anymore but the fries alone are worth coming for :)"}
{"text":"Avoid this place. The cook constantly smokes outside which is disgusting, then when she sees a customer she walks inside and begins cooking. DISGUSTING. They also lets friend and family park outside in the RED ZONE. AVOID. Just a grimy place."}
{"text":"I was working in the area and was craving gyros. So I stopped by Gyro House and they greet you right away with nothing but respect. Brett good people. Food portion is a pretty large size. Food was good, customer service is amazing. They keep the restaurant clean at all times. I would highly recommend this place if you're in the area. Keep up the work Gyro House. I will be back soon"}
{"text":"Nice clean place, they are very welcoming. I had the Gyro pladder which was very good not too much not too little comes with a really good Greek salad."}
{"text":"Delicious Mediterranean food. One of our favorite spots when visiting Phoenix. Very affordable."}
{"text":"The people running this place are nice, but the food is anything but Greek. My chicken kebab had never seen a skewer and I knew I was in trouble when I heard my food being fried in a pan in the kitchen.  The side salad was yummy, but I was taken aback when I saw canned green beans and tomatoes on my kebab plate.  It reminded me of something I'd see at a hospital cafeteria. The chicken was ok but greasy, served with heavily grilled oily onions. The pita bread was stale. For $14, it was hardly worth the money.  I sense the restaurant is doing poorly and cutting major corners at the expense of their customers."}
{"text":"Very food falafal and the pitas were fresh. The Baba Ghannouj was particularly delicious! The roasted eggplant flavor really carried through."}
{"text":"Like many hidden gems, the Gyro House is tucked in a nondescript, pretty empty strip mall. Luckily I stumbled onto this place and it's become a favorite lunch spot.  My favorites are the gyros, which are made fat and fantastic. You can grab one with fries for under $7. They have a lot of Middle Eastern faves like falafel and baba ghanoush, or if you're in for a bigger meal there's the kebabs or shawerma.  Bottom line is you won't find a better gyro for the price, and the good food and friendly staff have me going back at least once a week."}
{"text":"I constantly come here for the Gyro.  I haven't had a better one since I was stationed in Greece.  I am surprised it isn't more crowded.  I haven't had anything else here, but the Gyro is worth it."}
{"text":"today was my second visit to the gyro house. i was craving something mediterranean and remembered this place isn't too far from work. located in a nondescript ... no, that's not the right word ... rundown ... nope, that's still not quite right ... ok, completely ghetto, half empty strip mall that also houses a chinese restaurant and a second hand clothing store, the place does not look promising from the outside.  inside, there are 15 or so tables, comfortable molded plastic chairs and an extensive menu to choose from. everything on the menu is fairly priced with the most expensive being \"dinner for 2\" at $21.95. fountain drinks are $1. sandwiches ($5.95 - $6.95) are served with fries. i had the homemade falafel on a pita with super secret spices, fresh lettuce and tomato (and onion, but i picked that out) and it was yummy! french fries were hot, crispy and unsalted. i prefer them that way ... this way i can salt to my heart's content. anyway, the place isn't fancy, but it is fresh and clean, family owned and serves up some really good food. if you dig fancy, look no further than the back of the restaurant where they sell some pretty fancy-schmancy hookahs, and prices look fair to boot! so there you have it ... homemade falafel, french fries and fancy hookahs. what could be better? to me, not much. gyro house has earned a solid 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"There's not much to say - just go try this place!   - The gyros sandwich is SO good - maybe a bit on the salty side, but kind of goes with the territory.  - The fries & tzakiki are like crack. Ok, they ARE crack, but they won't rot your teeth.  - The gyro salad is great. I go for this when I'm not in a 'bready' mood.   And, there's a YouFit for anyone who stuffs themselves silly and wants to work it off. Ha.   Great little local place with solid food. Don't let the tiny corner put you off - give it a try!"}
{"text":"They have the best gyro meat in town. and their Greek Salad with gyro is my favorite. wonderful family business! I will definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"Great food, clean , friendly, good price and a lot of amazing food. What I order, gyro sandwich, small side of hummus with pita bread and/or French fries or substitute with Caesar salad or Greek. Don't forget to get the baklava. Such a delicious treat all under 20$!!!!"}
{"text":"The gyros are good with lots of meat. I would like more tomatoes  (my son doesn't agree). I like that they put the sauces on the side . Their cucumber sauce is excellent.  The current staff is friendly and welcoming, this wasn't always the case in the past."}
{"text":"This place took me bu surprise. It was delicious. The gyro meat is was spiced and cooked to perfection. The salads were great and very fresh. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm Gyro is always amazing. The meat is done differently than you would expect in a typical gyro. But it's fantastic! Tried the baklava for the first time today. It was way to much thick crust not flakey and light like I was hoping. Heavy and the filling I couldn't taste it was just overpowered by all the hard dough"}
{"text":"Gyro house is one of those places you never want to leave your area. Great Gyro's and very nice owners.. The whole family is here pretty often.  They have a large screen TV which always is showing one of the Finals games(NBA), and hookah is $10 here. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Family ran, homey restaurant. Nothing fancy inside but the food is delicious and the service is warm. And there was belly dancing too!  My husband is on a low carb diet so he had the Greek salad with gyro meat. He said it was delicious and he didn't feel the least bit deprived. I had the falafel sandwich with Greek fries. The falafel was perfect. The seasoning was delicious. And the Greek fries... holy moly. The feta and the sauce that came on them. To. Die. For.   They are BYOB with a $5 corkage fee. Still a great deal compared to the excessive markup of alcohol in restaurants.   Definitely one of the best Mediterranean restaurants in the valley!"}
{"text":"Went to the Gyro House for lunch today.  My sister has been telling me about this place for awhile.  I wasn't disappointed.  Family run business.  Marlene (I hope I got your name right?) was awesome!  The beef gyro was excellent.  The pita bread warm and so fresh it must've been made this morning.  I used to by Pita Bread back in Oxnard from a greek bakery so I know good pita bread!  Anyway, the gyro had just the right amount of meat with a great sauce, lettuce, tomatoes etc. It came with big fat fries cooked to perfection.   Ordered the baklava to go and it was delicious!  My only regret is this place isn't closer!"}
{"text":"This place might look a little divey from the outside, and inside, but the food is great!!!  The customer service was a little lacking the first time I came in. I stayed to the side, out of sight and looked over the menu. When I was ready, I approached the counter and waited well over a minute to be acknowledged. I saw that the female worker was busy putting together a to-go order, but even a \"Hello\" or an \"I'll be with you in just a moment\" would have made me feel like an appreciated customer.   Both times I've been there, the food was piping hot and tasted great!! The fries are perfectly crisp. The chicken gyro is stuffed with hot, grilled chicken and smothered with their yummy tzatziki sauce.  When I took my boyfriend there, he said, \"I can't believe we haven't come here sooner!!!\" He loved it, too!!  Good prices, great food.  Bummed that they are closed on Sundays though. $5 minimum on credit cards.  If you are coming from downtown and take the road that turns into a one way at the bridge, make sure you turn left into the parking lot on the left before you reach the stop sign. The street at the sign is one way and you're not supposed to turn left- therefore can't go towards the Gyro House!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, very friendly staff, and kid friendly. We all got Gyro platters and everything was delicious. Their cucumber white sauce is yummy, and so is their chicken soup! Thanks so much guys!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service . Falafel App was deliciously crispy and flavored just right . I had a chicken shawarma wrap and my bf had the beef gyro . The chicken was perfectly marinaded and tender . The beef gyro was \"bomb\". Pita was softest I've ever had . Bummer they didn't have any baklava left it would have rounded out the perfect meal ."}
{"text":"Delicious gyros and the salad is so yummy also! Food was super fresh , the service was great. Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"From the time we entered the door, until the time we left, the operators of this establishment treated us like on of the family. The atmosphere is homely and inviting. There seemed to be quite a bit of hookah smoking going on, which just added to the authentic environment. Unfortunately, we were there for carryout, but we will go back soon to enjoy a full sit down meal. We are looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Microwaved food over over over seasoned gyro meet horrible food and very expensive. There are much better Greek restaurants .."}
{"text":"Wonderful authentic food.  Great appetizer, best hummus I have had in ages.  Delicious gyro and chicken shawarma.  Had the Turkish coffees not many places serve that.   Love the family feel it's a must have if you really like Mediterranean food.   Boom"}
{"text":"Very excited to see they are reopening on 32nd and Cactus. Banner is up. Not sure when the open the door."}
{"text":"Great local establishment that we love, patio and dog friendly! Tried one of their new desserts, brownie pops! They were really good."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The food is amazing.  Everything they say in the other reviews.  The only drawback is the decor and location."}
{"text":"Got the Greek salad with 1/2 gyro 1/2 grilled chicken. The best gyro I've ever had. The grilled chicken was also very tasty and juicy. I will be back next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"best chicken gyro of my life. Also, fast and friendly service. I will be drooling over this for a while."}
{"text":"Yummy food and fast and friendly service. I look forward to my next visit. Also, the kids (ages 7 and 10) enjoyed it also and ate almost all of their gyros!"}
{"text":"I love a good gyro. I got the gyro dinner plate and it came with gyro meat and rice with a Greek salad and green beans in a tomato sauce. Overall delicious. Fast service. Staff is very nice. Will be going back again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a lark, as I really didn't expect much in this seedy strip mall, but since I love Mediterranean food and there are not many up this way, I gave it a shot.  Glad I did.  The food is homemade and very good, prices are reasonable, service is friendly, owner is lovely and all the reviews before me are spot on.   Oh, BTW, the gyros (which I am not typically fond of) were excellent.  He said it's all in how you slice the meat and he must be right, as it was thicker than most, therefore not dried out.  My daughter loved hers.  He makes his tzatziki from sour cream, not yogurt, and it's wonderful.  The gyro bread (pita) is my favorite kind, being the fluffier, softer version.  No complaints here.  I will be back.   You can't beat the price, quality and taste.  And yes, the sodas are only a $1 in a large glass with free refills.  Can't beat that.  Not even at McDonald's.  I will be back."}
{"text":"very rude ass people, called to ask about sponsorship for our team and the call said fuck off.. very rude"}
{"text":"Love this place! The inside is nothing special but for a quick bite to eat is is tasty and the price is right. Owner is very nice and the gyros are excellent. My mom lives nearby and I go often."}
{"text":"Wow.  This place is great!   I rarely go for gyros so I'm not sure what to compare them too,  all I know is that it was really tasty!!!  Well worth the price for What you get."}
{"text":"Great food, highly recommended chicken shawarma, gyro & kabobs. Take out, or eat in. Family owned and operated who work hard."}
{"text":"As one of the other reviewers had mentioned before; it is not the best decor inside or outside, but the food is great. I have to say that the Gyro here is probably amongst the best Gyros I have had before. You wouldn't imagine a place that is essentially bare to have some amazing food, but this place does it. I also had the Pierogies with the cooked onions, and it was mouth watering. This is a great place if you like Gyros and other Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Good, cheap, Greek. We've gotten take-out at least three times from Gyro House and have loved everything we've eaten so far. It's inexpensive and you get generous portions. Yeah, the inside is not fantastic, but we wouldn't choose to dine-in anyway. I recommend Gyro House for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is great & fresh! Very quick service.  Great prices.  Lived in area for years but never been here. It's definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! It's also the most authentic Mediterranean food I've ever had!! Its very clean and cute inside and the owner is very nice, and so passionate about his business. Everyone needs to try this place out!!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try a gyro here and boy is it delicious!!!! Their Greek salad, fatoush and thyme wrap are all so delicious as well. Can't wait for my next cheat day!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Phoenix to grab a tasty lamb/beef gyro for lunch! I usually order the same thing every time because I love it so much but the have plenty of yummy Greek options to choose from. I've also ordered their pita and hummus appetizer and it's great price for the amount of hummus you get which I must say is creamy and flavorful. The pita is also soft and everything you could want from a pita. Their tzatziki is YUM.   If you're in the area I highly recommend popping in for a filling and reasonably priced meal!  Oh and did I mention you can buy a take home Gyro kit?! SO COOL and you can share the gyro love with fam & friends."}
{"text":"Excellent family run place.  Have been there twice with delicious food.  Falafel sandwich served on soft pita. Excellent service.  Highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. Had a gyros sandwich with fries for six bucks. So large I couldn't finish it all- even after I gave some to my dog (yes I was sitting outdoors) Very courteous and fast service. I have had slightly better gyros before but for double the price. If I were ignoring the price then may have gone with 4 stars but would still rate the quality and taste excellent."}
{"text":"Ok, I love love their gyros. The meat is so flavorful.  I've compared them to Edens Grill.... gotta say Edens got nothing on this place.  It was a party in my mouth. The people who work their are so friendly.   Just found my new food joint."}
{"text":"Eat here all the time. I have yet to order anything I didn't like. They clearly make just about everything by hand, and use quality ingredients.   The owners are always there, and they are super nice and take great care to make sure your happy.   I recommend you give them a try, I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best gyro. The meat is grilled...I think? And it's really good. Outstanding. Fantastic service as well. 'Nuff said, I'll go back."}
{"text":"not only is it a great place to eat -but it's definitely got the capability to serve those when they need  catered meal....unbelievable menu options for catering and every single one of my guests had nothing to say but positive thing's.local family owned business that I would recommend anybody looking for great middle eastern food!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. There is something for everyone. I had quite possibly one of the best gyros of my life here. Family friendly, not too modern looking but the food makes up for it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great gyros. Kids loved them. Meat was big flavorful and juicy. I will be back"}
{"text":"The place has closed permanently. So sad. Looks like it'll be replaced with a burger shop."}
