{"text":"The food was excellent, we loved the avocado tacos!
The service was really excellent as well, Cyle was so friendly and welcoming! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for vegan or vegetarian food."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, plenty of natural light and fun decor. Good food, good service. My only suggestion would be to make sure the online menu is consistent with what is available in the restaurant. Glad to have it in the neighborhood. Friendly for vegetarians, vegans, and omnivores. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I work on Lorain so I was really delighted to see this restaurant finally open. I got off early the other day and stopped in with my coworkers to sit down for a lunch. This is a vegan restaurant but don't avoid it if you're a meat lover like me because they do have a menu for carnivores and you can also add meat on to any vegan dish. I always love trying a dish on a restaurants menu without any changes so I tried the \"Neat Balls and Sauce\" it was amazing! I highly recommend if you're in the area to swing by!"}
{"text":"Not for me. Dinner service was slow even though there was only two other guests in the restaurant. Food was okay. Cleveland Vegan is way better in terms of flavor and variety. Very confused about other higher reviews posted here."}
{"text":"Hands down the best vegan breakfast and options in town! There are plenty of options for non-vegan patrons as well. Everything is freshly made. The breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwich are incredible. My kids were excited to have the vegan pancakes and French toast. The owner has done an amazing job of creating a unique space with repurposed barn wood for the flooring and a beautiful waterfall. Super friendly and knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with my wife and mother in law. 

First, the setting. The decor and layout is quite beautiful. They do a splendid job of mixing rustic with modern, and the result is a very comfortable area that feels both earthy and fresh. 

The service was a bit less fresh. The place was basically empty when we came in, and despite that everything was very slow. We thought it may go faster since we all basically got the same thing (street tacos) but it was very slow throughout the whole meal.

However, the food was (somewhat) redeeming. It was pretty good - my wife loved the slaw on the street tacos in particular! However, there was one small issue that I can't get over. For the taco shells, we asked the swap out flour tortillas for corn tortillas. They were more than willing, but told us that they wouldn't be able to fry the corn tortillas. When we inquired further, our server told us that the cook told her that the corn tortillas could not be fried because they would fall apart. 

The look on my MILs face was comical as she insisted the corn tortillas could be deep fried. Her exact words were \"I'm Mexican, I do it all the time\". So they fried them - or, at least, they tried to. They came out all swollen and puffy, not at all a crispy shell like you would expect. They still tasted amazing! It's just - if you're going to offer tacos please know how to deep fry a tortilla!"}
{"text":"Came all the way out here from North Ridgevile yesterday with two friends.  We all follow a plant based, no oil diet. What a treat to have so many options!  Our server, Grace was very helpful and informative.  We got the vegetable soup to start and it was awesome!  We ordered the agave soy portobello mushroom, squash noodle pasta & the \"neat\"  balls & sauce. We each tasted all 3 dishes. They were ALL delicious!  We will definitely be back. Next time we'll try their brunch. I hope the word gets out about this vegan gem. Cleveland needs more healthy restaurants like this."}
{"text":"First time we checked this new restaurant out! It's wonderful! From the vibe to the food - down right great! We had the BsLT and the Beet Burger. Hand cut FF, tasty and delicious Beet Burger, BsLT was super original using squash as the \"bacon\". There are a few options for meat eaters but for once this is a place that offers more vegan options than meat. Really a wonderful spot. And, our server was just great. Can't wait to try the other meals here. All vegans/vegetarians and even meat eaters in CLE need to check this place out. Very cute first date kinda place too!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday evening with a couple of friends and an out of town guest.  Let me start by saying I'll definitely go back.  Everyone spoke pretty well of their food. I had the soup of the day which was amazing.  It wad a lightly cinnamony, rich dark veggie soup with just a little heat.  There was a generous amount of veggies in the bowl and if I'm honest I would easily find myself going back just for it.  I also built a meal of a couple appetizers.  I had the veggie tempura and the seared avocado tacos.  The tempura was crisp  and light, not overly greasy and could easily rival a what is offered at a Japanese restaurant.  It came with a typical soy based dipping sauce and a surprising avocado based sauce that was creamy and a little tart.  I liked it a lot.  The tacos were equally good and I believe the light flakey shells were fresh fried in the back.  They had probably half an avocado each and were topped with a light crisp fresh purple cabbage slaw.  (Think a pickle type slaw not creamy mayo type slaw.) Anyhow it was good.  I finished the meal with a hot cup of coffee.  The service was a little slow at first owing to a lack of second server.  Once she clocked in everything smoothed out.  Lastly I would have liked a little heat for my tacos, a house made hot sauce perhaps?  Anyhow that's a minor nitpick, I guess I could smuggle in a little of my own.  All told the place is good for vegans and they do offer carnivore selections for those craving meat.  I recommend checking them out, it's definitely worth the time."}
{"text":"What a great little gem of a restaurant. I would encourage anyone that is vegetarian or vegan to give this warm and cozy cafe a try for some comfort food, with a friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch at Water Garden Cafe. They have a lot of healthy, vegan/vegetarian food items, which is why I decided to give it a try. I love that I could eat something that tasted so good and was so healthy! Whoever said healthy food doesn't taste good clearly has not eaten here before. The food had excellent flavor and our server was extremely nice. I definitely recommend the Agave Soy Marinated Portobello!"}
{"text":"not really sure what happened at my visit since everyone else's reviews are so stellar. i went for saturday brunch by myself. it was really busy, every table was seated. the hostess/waitress was clearly overworked as she was by herself. however she also was super inefficient, or the restaurant is set up very inefficiently. for example she had to walk all the way across the restaurant repeatedly for basic things like napkins.
the food was just ok honestly. i didn't get toast as was stated on the menu, and that took a really long time to get to me after i asked for it. like more than 10 minutes. the portion was small for the price. i left hungry. the whole dining experience took over an hour. i noticed several other people at the restaurant who were also getting antsy about service and their food taking so long.
i'm vegetarian so i would love to have a spot to go to. have my doubts, but i will be back to give them another try."}
{"text":"This place caught my eye when it first opened, with its vegan options as well as meat options that seemed creative and refreshing. Plus it's in a neighborhood down Lorain that is a little bit off the beaten hipster path further up the street, so I was intrigued.

I brought my vegetarian friend here on Saturday evening, thinking she would appreciate the veggie options. We were the only patrons in the restaurant, but the space itself was very large and pleasant--with a water feature right in the middle.

Our server was personable and friendly, offering recommendations of what to get. Both me and my friend decided to try the \"neatballs\" after much debate, since I'm usually vehemently opposed to ordering the same entree as my company. At first we thought we'd start with the tamales, but upon the server's recommendation we ordered the street tacos with fried avocado. One minute after ordering, the server came back to tell us that there was only one order of \"neatballs\" left, so my friend opted to get the portobello entree. 

Our food came out, and both of us were underwhelmed by our dishes. My \"neatballs\" were pretty tasty and came with three, but the brown rice was bland and \"avocado sauce\" on the plate was strange (and not in a good way). The pickled onion was good, but there was not nearly enough of that. My friend really enjoyed her portobello and it was seasoned very well. However, most of her plate was filled with underseasoned zucchini and basil mashed cauliflower, which she ended up not eating. The server had forgotten to put in our order of the street tacos, and so we waited for our appetizers after finishing our entrees. That was a mistake; these street tacos were by far the lowlight of our experience. They were large tacos, but the fried avocado, jicama slaw, and friend tortilla shell (with a side of that strange, plastic-like avocado sauce) did not work for either of us, taste or texture-wise. We couldn't bring ourselves to finish the tacos.

Also towards the end of our meal, we were distracted by a couple of fruit flies flying around our table, scavenging the leftover food on our plates. My friend and I laughed about this and weren't really bothered by it, but not part of the experience I was hoping for. I really wanted to like this place and see it succeed, but I fear that won't be the case given our dinner here. We likely won't be returning, but have no regrets trying this place out! It was definitely a meal to remember!!"}
{"text":"Try the portabello!

The menu is reasonably short so they can do a few things well. There are 7 or 8 good vegetarian and vegan entrees and about the same on the non-vegetarian side."}
{"text":"Such a great experience! My sister, who is vegan, was in town visiting, and we found Water Garden on Yelp. SO worth the visit! I actually tried the Vegan Breakfast Plate instead of my typical eggs and sausage routine, and it was AMAZING! Perfect place to try out vegan alternatives because the flavor is great. Awesome service by Grace too! I'll definitely be back often!"}
{"text":"First time at Water Garden Cafe was absolutely amazing. This vegan friendly restaurant can cater to anyone. Loved the menu and atmosphere here. Great place to study or just come for a delicious meal. This time we tried the Waffles, Rice Paper Bacon, and Breakfast Bowl. Can't wait to come back to try their brunch, dinner and sandwich menus! @thegrassfedredhead --"}
{"text":"Delicious and reasonable! It's a little inefficient at times but I love the vegan options--especially the brunch platter. I could imagine once they get more up and running that they could easily give Cleveland Vegan a run for their money."}
{"text":"What a neat little gem on Lorain Road. We had Sunday brunch and it was all vegan. We ordered the  pancakes, vegan plate, gravy and biscuits, waffle and chicken( breaded cauliflower). All the food was delicious and full of flavor. The portion sizes will not leave you hungry. They also have meat options for those who eat meat. I loved that the vegan 'meats' were all veggies and not made from soy or wheat gluten. Sorry no photos. The food tasted so good it was half gone before I thought of taking a photo."}
{"text":"Pedestrian at best. Came for breakfast. No bar. Should have left upon seeing the gauche waterfall. Waited for an hour for three meatless entrees. Coffee: terrible. Tofu scramble: TERRIBLE. One person in the kitchen sans hairnet. One waitress who did her best but true temper revealed as we requested condiments for our meal. Waited patiently for check.......Dine somewhere else."}
{"text":"Based on this one visit, this is my new favorite brunch place in town. Options for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores. All the food we had was fantastic and sensibly priced. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to see the Water Garden open in my neighborhood. This part of Lorain has a lot of good vintage and antique shops, but there has never been a good dining option. I was pleasantly surprised to see many vegan and vegetarian sides and entrees on the menu, which also includes plenty of dishes for omnivores too. Service was attentive and accommodating. The owners have put a lot of time, care, and money into making the building look great inside and out. If you're looking to try a new vegetarian spot or if you get hungry in the middle of a marathon antiquing session, I recommend the Water Garden."}
{"text":"First thing first there are meat options if you are / are with an omni but they have a giant selection of vegan options. 

A couple friends and I are doing a vegan month so I stumbled upon Water Garden Cafe when I was looking for lunch options open on Mondays. Having never heard of this place I was a bit iffy but turns out it's pretty new and I could not be more ecstatic about it! There's not much around it so it was super easy to find parking. The inside is absolutely adorable which shouldn't matter but it gave a good first impression. 

The menu looks pretty small but they also had flip cards with probably eight additional vegan entrees. Water Garden's menu is very creative for a vegan restaurant as in it's not the same old 5 vegan dishes you always see but none of it is \"weird\" either. To give you an idea of how fresh the food is- we sat in the front window and at one point our server ran up to grab some fresh rosemary from the terrarium for one of the dishes. 

We ended up with the raw zucchini sushi, veggie stack (a big plantain / eggplant parm type dish), the zucchini noodles, and two desserts- chocolate avocado mousse and strawberry basil ice. Usually I'm just a one course kinda gal but I got too excited about all the tasty options and ended up with three... Opps. 

I loved our server she was chatty in a good way and told us about the menu and their plans to expand the back into a patio and garden. The whole cafe gave off a very comfortable friendly vibe and you can tell all of the staff is very close. The only downside I could see is their water glasses are quite small so maybe they could get some of the table bottles so they didn't have to refill so much. 

Everything I got here was great and super refreshing. Rarely do you feel more energized than sleepy after a three course lunch so I cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Server was new, so I wont get into that.  A helpful hint though-lay off the cologne.  I have been home for and hour and I can still smell it. 

I was excited, i didnt manage my expectations, and I was let down. Wow. The most bland food I have ever had. had the beet burger, fries, chick pea salad sandwich and the vegan tamales.  Everything was so tasteless. Very disappointing. 

The place is nice, friendly people, but the food just isnt good."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped in.

There were so many choices on the menu that interested us. We ended up getting the pulled pork sandwich (yes they have vegetarian, vegan, and omnivore options) and the BLT (vegan option where the \"bacon\" is actually smoked butternut squash strips) on GF bread. I got a side of avocado aioli instead of the vegan mayo that comes with it.

The food was delicious, fresh and plated
beautifully. 

One note: the menus were a bit confusing. It turns out that their breakfast menu goes from 8am to 1pm. Their lunch menu goes from 1pm to 8pm. And their sandwich menu goes all day."}
{"text":"No longer vegan, but I got avocado tacos. They were yummy. Then chocolate avocado mouse for desert. Pot roast was incredible."}
{"text":"I'm a carnivore but some of my family are vegetarian. 
Finding a spot where we all really enjoy what's on the menu is hard. 
These guys do a great job taking care of all of us. 
Love this spot."}
{"text":"My daughter chose this restaurant for her 21st birthday breakfast. We had an amazing meal and our server was friendly and efficient. He even brought her a free dessert. We had two vegans, a vegetarian and two who ate from the regular menu. Everyone enjoyed their food. We came up from Akron but we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Visited today with mother and mother-in-law for Mother's Day brunch. It was awesome to find a place offering multiple vegan and non-vegan breakfast items. It's a rare find and usually one or the other only. The location is a bit sketchy, and, if you're visiting with someone with a disability, know that the entrance is kind of awkward for anyone with a walker. The decor is very nice, pretty waterfall, if a bit loud. 

I loved the homemade lemonade; my mom hated it. It was very light and not sweet at all, perfect for me, a let-down for mom. I tried to take hers home, but the server handed me a small coffee cup which would only hold half of it, and no stopper for the lid.

I had the vegan breakfast burrito, and it tasted amazing. The potatoes that came with it were delicious, and I loved their pico de gallo. It was very fresh and light. For dessert, I had the grilled pineapple with vegan ice cream. This was also good, but the scoop of ice cream was way too small, and there was a little bit too much shredded coconut on it for my taste. Overall, it tasted tropical, and it was good.

My mother-in-law had the omnivore breakfast burrito, and she seemed to really enjoy it. There was plenty of food, and neither of us were able to finish our entrées. My mom had a traditional omnivore breakfast of egg, potatoes and toast with a side of bacon. She said everything was just OK. She did love the homemade jelly. 

Service was friendly, but extremely slow, and we had to keep reminding our server to bring items. We waited about 20 minutes for our check at the end of the meal, and then the server blocked our exit because he was standing next to our table serving another customer, and the spacing is so narrow, we could not get through.

My mother-in-law and I both agreed that we would return again if we lived closer. My mom voted not to return. 

I think with a bit more practice, service will improve and this place will be a fantastic option. I wish it were located closer to my home so I could try lunch and do brunch again."}
