{"text":"I thought the food was pretty good. It's a lot like the last Chinese buffet that was there before them, but I found the food in this place to be more flavorful.   I wish they had more of a vegan selection, and I wish they labeled all their food as not everything has labels on it, especially if they could specify the ingredients in each item for people that don't eat certain foods due to dietary restrictions.   Their fried rice has egg in it which is traditional, but I won't eat it, and they also don't make any veggie eggrolls they are spring rolls with fish in them, but their Lo mein is very good and their stir fry bar is good.   I wish they would put small bowls out at the stir fry bar like the last owners did for the many sauces that are used in the stir fries as I spilled a bunch of sauces all over the place trying to fit it all on my plate.   The service was good and everyone was friendly.   They have a good dessert bar and are much smarter for not having the soft serve ice cream machine but rather little individual ice cream cups which is much more sanitary.   All in all, I would definitely eat here again and recommend it to other people."}
{"text":"Oh yah I wish I would have read the reviews before trying this place. I would have past it up! Ewww Sashimi that had fallen on the counter next to the sushi (opps, I'm messy) was back on the plate when I walked by again. Food that looked hot and steaming was hard and cold by the time you walked back to your table. Soup looked like it had been sitting there since breakfast!   Pass this place up !! Still on the hunt for good Asian food!"}
{"text":"Lovely service and decent food.  The newly remodeled kitchen and food seems better than previous one, check by yourself."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for Elevate Concert from Las Vegas (Land of Chinese Buffets). We stopped in for lunch while having a tire repaired at Discount Tire across the parking lot. We were very impressed with the wide selection of both hot and cold dishes. Having 9 food stations. Unlike many buffets in Las Vegas all foods were clearly labeled. Temperature of foods were totally right. Flavors were midrange not overly or under spicy The help was readily available to assist and refresh drinks and take plates. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, a lot of varieties. Taste is delicious. Would definitely come back here. Not many people know this place though."}
{"text":"Just ate here with my 16 year old daughter, found 2 pitch black pube looking Asian hairs in my food, showed the waitress, she gets some jagoff manager that can barely speak Engrish, says \"our cook wear hairnet must be customah,\" pretty much said FU to him, same exact crap place as the old buffet they just changed their name.  For $40 bucks I got some three time reheat chicken with a side of spidermonkey hair and not even a reach-around.  I'd rather eat at Fillibertos than this craphole.  You suck Peony or whatever the hell you call yourself now."}
{"text":"Got sick after eating here -- Not sure where the positive reviews are really coming from, but this is exactly the same place as before. Same setup, same limited selection, mediocre quality on all meat items on buffet, and price is too high at $16 for what is offered. To top it off, I got extremely ill after eating here, sick to my stomach for 2 hours. They were closed down for poor hygiene, seems it has not changed. Sorry I gave the new location a shot. We'll stick with Lin's."}
{"text":"I gave those three stars, not that it equates to three stars in a regular restaurant. I would give it 2 stars otherwise. But because I'm rating it against other buffets... 3. We went tonight which was a Wednesday about 7 PM and it was not very busy. The food was not very good but it was not as bad as all those places that end up going out of business. For example the one that was there before had good food initially for a long time and then went downhill and then out of business. These people are very nice and I think they want to do a good job with a buffet priced for the average person. If you want good food don't go to a buffet. Or go to one that's more expensive. For example one of the casinos around here and you still don't get great food.  You do get better food.  But those buffets are $35 a person instead of $20 a person. And if you want really good food like the buffet at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles you have to go to a place like that. I don't even know what that place charges anymore.  Hopefully the food is better when it is busy. Fresh. They are very nice people and I hope they can do well and stay in business. But I have a bad feeling."}
{"text":"PAY ATTENTION TO THE MANY 5 STAR HONEST REVIEWS. THe negative reviews don't make sense. Most are from single men that are outright dishonest. No wonder they are single menNegative reviews from negative people who don't have a clue what good CHINESE food is. What bad customer service, everyone in there are friendly and attentive. What do they want someone to feed them like a 2 yr old. It's a buffet. You get napkins a fork and a drink and plates removed. . Notice the price complaints on weights and take out. They want the same price no matter what the weight is or more expensive items are more expensive on take out. Read the sign or have some who can read explain how it works. If it's too expensive for you to pay don't hate the restaurant. Get a higher paying job or go to panda express and save your pennies eating fast food garbage if that's what you like so much why didn't you go there to begin with. Shame that unhappy dishonest people write the nonsense they do. Maybe their own hair is falling out in their own noodles. All they write is 95-200% dishonest.These comments are from insane people. Not a clue there  are no restaurant. Com coupons that the restaurant put out yet someone wants it to be honored anyway. People want excellent food at cheap prices . You won't find cheap prices at excellent restaurants. For the quality and taste and choices and service if you can't afford the prices why did you walk in the door and complain about the cost and leave a negative review. If this is bad food you must be eating in the wrong named restaurant. Maybe you were in the MEXICAN restaurant on the other end because honestly the reviews that are negative can't realistically be real. Some people try to ruin things for others. If you are a positive honest person you won't write negative total nonsense! Do yourself a favor and ignore any negative reviews you might read.Not one dish is dry. All dishes are cooked with bursting flavor. If you read a negative review they must have eaten the paper napkins. Also the service is top notch there is no waiting for anything or no napkins. Unless you need napkins to bring home for free you'll have enough for dinner! This Chinese buffet is the highest quality food you will find at any CHINESE buffet in Arizona. If you are looking for the best tasting, freshest and most delicious items this is the only place to eat. Everything we ate on a Saturday grand opening was bursting with flavor. It is like having a private chef for your family where each item has its own unique flavors. The chicken beef and pork dishes were very hot and is better than any Chinese buffet in the state of Arizona. The spare ribs are amazing quality and taste. All meat cooked perfectly with a perfect sauce. The spiced crab is also the best you will ever eat. The lomein is as good as any restaurant. Everything was absolutely the best CHINESE food of any buffet we have ever eaten. The customer service is excellent. The floor manager keeps everything full and flowing. They care about their customers satisfaction, 100% . You might find a bigger selection somewhere else but you will never get better taste or higher quality"}
{"text":"1. Food tastes good. Well above average  2. The environment is very good. Well air conditioned, clean, quiet, and spacious.  3. The price for a Saturday buffet is fine only it includes the drinks. Currently it does not."}
{"text":"The sushi is made fresh here and the soups are great, especially the hot and sour soup! They have a nice variety of food to choose from and they have healthy selections as well."}
{"text":"First time here. Conveniently located near home & Dad & I were jonesing for Chinese food. A friend recommended this place & so we tried it.   Pretty nice place. The people who run it are very welcoming & friendly. They are totally on top of getting drinks filled & taking plates away as you're preparing to go for another round of food.   Various types of food items make up each section, including a separate sushi area & one for desserts to sweeten the palate with.   Only drawback? It was a little pricey but we thought it was worth it."}
{"text":"This is one of the best buffet restaurants in Phoenix, highly recommended for the sushi, the fish is so fresh and sweet, plus soft warm rice, it's melting in your mouth!!! Good!"}
{"text":"I was hoping this restaurant would be good since it's so close to my home but I was disappointed.  You can see the steam coming off that's  hot serving table but the food inside was cold how can I be?  The sushi was okay but stay away from the salmon it tasted bad in my stomach hurts. 30 minutes after eating it.  They were quickly to refill my glass with water but they are stingy on handing out napkins.  I try to find my waitress to ask for another napkin but cannot be found.  You have to track someone down to pay the bill.  I hope I don't get sick but my stomach is truly bothering me now."}
{"text":"My family of 4 ended up paying $81, not worth it at all. It was completely empty, I feel like they are charging those that do come in for the ones that don't come in. Food was blah..."}
{"text":"Great new buffet with hot food great selections and decent prices. Crab legs were good and Food was fresh. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Amazing service  Horrible food everything is dry there's no flavor in anything I ate."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by the sushi and Mongolian sections here. The Mongolian section has beef and chicken that were not kept cool and at a safe temperature and I did speak with the manager about the sushi station. I felt the area and the sushi and raw fish were not kept chilled. She commented that sheaves sushi a little at a time every 5-15 minutes and this was untrue because there was the same raw fish sushi out there for over an hour. She also pointed to the rating that thru received. Please be careful about eating their sushi or Mongolian section. I will be contacting the health department."}
{"text":"Located at the old Hong Kong buffet, Peony Garden is fresh, with great food. I DETEST eggplant but I Love theirs! Orange Chicken also excellent and their egg rolls too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure : I'm allergic to shellfish, so there is a lot here I can't eat.  Given that, this was one of my hubby's favorite buffets, so had to check out the new ownership.   On the positive side, the place seems cleaner overall.  The hot and sour soup was very good.  They have all the standard buffet entrees, which were okay. The beef in the pepper beef was really tender.   Lots of cold items - fruits, salads, etc. lots of seafood items (but I didn't try them!) the hubby thought the green mussels were really good.    Several sushi items, but they weren't labeled, so I couldn't try them. The fried chicken wings were really tasty! And the wasabi was up to the hubby's standard (which is a rarity!).   I was sorry they took out the soft serve machine, but glad they have regular ice cream you scoop yourself.   Several other items did not warn if there were seafood in them (wontons, egg rolls, spring rolls), so I was very limited in what I was comfortable eating.   Service was attentive, and they were on top of refilling trays as needed.   Please consider labeling more carefully so I can give a higher rating!   BTW - they have a very large private room if you need a venue for a meeting or party."}
{"text":"We were so exciting to try this \"new\" place but it was a huge disappointment nothings change it's still the same... food was horrible I didn't like anything at all! This place really needs to change menu cooks management change it up in there too it's just not appealing to the eye when you go in. Everything had been sitting out for a while when we went in."}
{"text":"A change for the better...we stopped going to the Hing Kong old place about a year ago because the quality of the food had dropped drastically since the ownership changed.  NOW a New change, New...complete change of owners and business.  What a change, the food was fantastic, fresh and it has a great refreshed taste not the same old stuff. I was impressed we figured we'd try it and boy what a great surprise...  I would suggest it for lunch or dinner.."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. but the last wasn't so great!! Horrible service(every time iv been in) and my buddy got sick from the oysters the next day(he was the only one who ate them) what I ate I thought was alright.. but was stale and cold.. But it's mainly about the service in my opinion.. u gotta make people feel welcome! Never again!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now since new owners took over and have to say it is much improved from the old owners. If all your looking for is tempura fried this and that then this is not your place, that was the old owners. This has pretty authentic, semi-Americanized Asian food. You will find at least 4 different ways shrimp is prepared from sautéed garlic prawns (whole), coconut, peel and eat boiled, garlic stir fried w/ veggies and of course fried shrimp (that's 5) to assorted stir fry veggies, steamed buns, pork gyoza both steamed and fried, snow crab (tiny legs tho), muscles, clams, crawdads (yes I said crawdads), Panko fried fish, salmon and even sushi, carved beef, chicken skewers and desserts if you can fit it all in. There are also variety of stir fried dishes with pork, beef, chicken or tofu. I guess if you are unfamiliar with some of the dishes and afraid to try them then this would not be your restaurant. How someone could come away from here still hungry is insane. And to complain that $15.99 is high priced is also insane! Where do you eat? Jack in the Crack? Taco Smell? Any dinner at another restaurant would easily cost the same and you get one dinner, not unlimited amounts of very good food.  I have found the staff to be very welcoming and friendly. Some do not speak fluent English but they try their best...so be patient. They are usually on top of drinks and clearing away old dishes. Buffet managers are good about bringing out fresh entrées when old ones are depleted. Restaurant is very clean too.  The first time I came I almost ate myself sick and loaded 2 plates because I was surprised at all the shrimp that was available. I don't do buffets often because of this reason. My friend suggested it because we both are shrimp lovers and she had been here before. If you like a variety of Asian food you will enjoy it.   This last time a friend had some of the carved beef and said it was chewy. I think it still cooks from the hot steam underneath and may get too done. Personally I don't go to Asian restaurants to eat American dishes so I skipped it. Think with all the food they have they could probably let the beef go. They haven't been open long and are probably feeling out the crowds and will make adjustments to some of what they offer."}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR $. Definitely the worst chinese food and buffet ever. If I could give this a negative star I would. After telling the server how terrible the food was he told the 'Owner' who said nothing to me even though she was next to me speaking in her language. I don't have an issue with that however they never bothered to ask what was wrong. They also keep the AC at what felt like 90 degrees. I should not be sweating inside a restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. The place is really great and big. The price are extremely fair. The food is always fresh and delicious. There are many food choices. Their crab legs and grilled mussels are phenomenal. Surprisingly, the sushi and sashimi are fresh than other buffets I had ever been to. The chief at sushi bar could take orders from you. And the servers here are really friendly.  By far, the best Chinese buffet in the state from pricing, cleanliness, food choices, staffs."}
{"text":"Last week we went to this peony garden Buffet  And we were very satisfied with the buffet so I m going to bring my friends there for a party"}
{"text":"It's one of those all you-can-eat-Chinese-food-until-my-pants-don't-fit kind of night and Peony Garden Buffet hit the spot! I fully recommend you stop by, and it's conveniently located right off of I-10"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  I live in Maricopa City.  I bought a restaurant.com (like a Groupon) certificate for Peony Garden to try something new with my kids.  The price is a bit high for what you get- $15.99 per person, kids over 9 are priced as an adult, for Chinese buffet-When it came time to pay, they REFUSED to accept the restaurant.com certificate, blaming restaurant.com for advertising wrong.  Instead of honoring it to keep a potential customer."}
{"text":"First, take the positive reviews with a grain of salt as they give a discount to anyone who shows a positive review.  Almost everything I tried was bland and seriously needed more flavor.  The Mongolian BBQ used to be awesome here, but I think the new management/employees are still trying to figure it out.  I ended up leaving an entire plate of food, paying, and going somewhere else because I was still hungry.  Definitely not worth the price anymore."}
