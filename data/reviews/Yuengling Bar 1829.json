{"text":"Fresh Yueng on tap, fast friendly service, flushes the airport / travel BS away.  Only improvement would be a few Lazy Boys for those longer depart delays."}
{"text":"Service was so slow, and could not get anything correct without having to repeat myself multiple times. Also paid zero attention to any customers more focused on putting her tips in the POS."}
{"text":"The beer gets a 4 - it's Yuengling at the Cleveland Airport, after all.  The pulled pork sandwich came with chips & a little cup of coleslaw, but not much flavor.  The meat could have been any meat and the sauce was so mild it almost disappeared.  None of the pungency or bite of good, flavorful pulled pork.  But a good rule of thumb is to eat and sleep when you're in a position where either might not happen for a long time, and if the stupidity of a sequester implemented purposely to annoy fliers hits you and you need sustenance, the Yuengling will at least ease the pain."}

{"text":"Well, I was flying through here  THE FOOD  Nothing exceptional. The menu is on the wall to the side, so feel free to not wait for one to be given to you, as there are apparently none to be given.  SETTING  Airport restaurant. Yep, that's it.  SERVICE  Slow to notice us, slow to explain the menu even slower to come back to us to take any orders. Never came back to refill our drinks and it even took effort to pay.   SUMMARY  Well, if you are hungry... Otherwise try a couple of the other places at the terminal. I have no personal experience, but can't see it being any worse."}
