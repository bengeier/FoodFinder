{"text":"Very nice venue in the old port with big windows in the front and numerous tables in the back to accommodate large groups. The quality of the food is standard Java-U : good sandwiches but expect to pay around 10 to 15$ for a combo with your favorite coffee. Most of the staff is super friendly and you can see that the owner cares for good service. For the bad, the WiFi connection is not reliable when you sit in front, which is unfortunate considering its the area with the most sunlight. There is very few power outlets which limit where you can sit and work with your laptop."}
{"text":"This Java U location share space with a dep and a car wash, but it makes the most out of its bizarre living arrangements. The seating's a bit cramped up, but combining the coffee/sandwiches of the Java U with the trappings of a dep (snack racks, pop coolers, ice cream) is a stroke of genius. A good take-out counter in the middle of nowhere."}
{"text":"Meal - coffee and croissant. Croissant was fresh and just right.  Lots of seating and tables and lighting! Not dark and dingy."}
{"text":"This Java U is located right on the outskirts of Old Montreal close to downtown, probably an ideal location for street traffic from locals to/from work, and to tourists walking to/from the old part of the city. I, of course, was one of the latter. I really enjoyed the vibe walking into the building- the decor was very hip, trendy, but upscale with beautiful chandeliers overhead.  Leather chairs adorned the front for the coffee drinkers/hang-outers, while the back opened up nicely to a bunch of tables for people who stopped in for a meal. The staff were very nice and friendly to the English-speaking tourist, and the coffee and the pastry that I purchased tasted great."}
{"text":"All the fancy shmancy pseudo-Italian coffee bars take note: this is what a real Italian \"bar\" looks like. Some chairs, coffee, some food, magazines, ice cream and whatever..."}
{"text":"This Middle Eastern coffee chain has burgeoned into a full on \"thing\" here in Montreal, and I have to say, I was not disappointed.   First off, this location in le vieux Montréal in nicely appointed on rue McGill though also a bit off the beaten track so besides lunch rush, you'll easily have the place all to yourself midweek. The café counter offers and nice selection of panini, wraps, a fresh chopped salad station and 1-2 soups of the day -- plus all your caffeination needs.   The decor is modern, yet wonderfully pretty with comfortable booths, mirrors, communal tables and elaborate chandeliers. The fact that they have free, consistent WiFi is a huge plus and while plugs aren't everywhere, you won't find it difficult to get a comfortable spot with access for hours on end."}
{"text":"It's an airport coffee shop.   Higher prices and the coffee wasn't great.   Service was friendly.   Overall, average. You'll do okay."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick breakfast before my flight. Lineup here is considerable shorter vs those at Starbucks and Tim Hortons. Service is quick and efficient.  The coffee (Americano) and breakfast sandwich were just OK. Given their price tag, I would have expected more.  Average but plugged the hole and that's what I was looking for."}
{"text":"today i went there again for takeout. they forget to give me chocolatine but didnt forget to charge my credit card for that."}
{"text":"I came across this spot while connecting a flight to Quebec City. In need of a decent quick-fix meal, Java U stood out from the Tim Horton's and Starbucks in the same area. The sandwiches and baked goods looked appealing and on first time there, I had the Java Club which can be toasted and warmed up by the barista. After the first bite, maybe because I was hungry but I kept going and finished both halves of it. And I returned here on the way back from Quebec and this time had Le Bechamel, which again was toasted. I had one half of it (which retained its warmth) while waiting for the plane to take off and the cheese oozed out, yummy! Yeah, both sandwiches seem pricey but boy are they good. This coffee spot is distinct and different and it's a better choice for your grab'n'go while your waiting for a flight at Pierre Elliot Trudeau airport."}
{"text":"Not much in the area. Java u always have a good selection. Sad witches are great and have a good selection of gluten free products. I enjoy the Shanghai Asian chicken sandwich and there salads.  Not too much place to sit for a coffee place so expect to order to go. They also sell wine which was surprising. Friendly service but a little slow."}
{"text":"I'm in this airport often. Every time I'm here, I look forward to their breakfast special, which is a Montreal bagel toasted with Philadelphia cream cheese and your choice of regular or dark roast coffee.  All for $3.49 plus tax.    They really pack on the cream cheese, which I love because I can dip my bagel for some extra cheese with every bite.  I really enjoy the way they do it because it's perfectly toasted and warm, never burned. Every bite is amazing.  I would like to say the same about the coffee, but it's just ok.  I usually just get the regular coffee, and it doesn't do much for me.  They also offer a variety of breakfast sandwiches and baked goods.  And, the staff is nice.  I've never actually just ordered the bagel alone.  But, I think next time I'll just get the bagel without the coffee."}
{"text":"Ordered the la dolce vita and the la namur breakfast sandwich. Both were good,  but I think they used Caramel instead of the advertised coffee crunch.  The 2 Filipino girls had a hostel/miserable chemistry between the 2, like they hated everyone And there job,  felt uncomfortable. The shorter Filipina came off rude,  and ate cake in between making a pilots sandwhich,  but at least they were nicer to him.  Dunno......1st time here,  trying something new tired of starbucks, there are other places at this airport to buy $14 worth of breakfast,  that would probably create your coffee as described. Tim Hortons has that honey doughnut, yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a cafe in the airport. Their chai latte is OK. This is near gate c departure."}
{"text":"very nice chill place with very nice bilingual staff. I basically stayed here all day working on my laptop. It gets a little crowded  during lunch but not much. the latte and heated crab wrap I had was good. Bathroom and a cozy lounge with couches on the second floor."}
{"text":"Stale croissants! Shame on you taking advantage of a captive clientèle! With no hesitation on exaggerated pricing!"}
{"text":"The breakfast options were all pre-made but perfectly fine for the price (which is very reasonable, considering the proximity to nearby tourist sites). The lone staffer remained amiable even when things got busy, and he turned out a variety of nicely made espresso drinks.  You might wind up here when you can't get a table at Le Cartet, but decor-wise it's just as nice, if that's any consolation."}
{"text":"Dès que je suis entrée au Java U sur McGill, en essayant de décider quel plat du menu je devrais prendre, j'ai apperçu une affiche qui encourage les gens de faire leurs \"check-in\" via quelques média sociaux, dont Yelp. Je n'ai donc pas pû m'empêcher de commencer mon expérience avec un sourire sur le visage.  J'y suis allée à quelques reprises, parfois pour le lunch et d'autres fois pour un simple café. J'aime la proximité du café du Vieux Montréal et surtout son décor. Les choix sont presque tous les mêmes dans les Java U de la ville, et celui là n'est pas vraiment différent, bien qu'il donne l'impression d'avoir un plus grand menu. Les cafés sont bons, le nourriture est bonne, mais rien d'extraordinaire. Pas mal ce à quoi je m'attends d'un café du genre. Ils ont internet gratuit qui fonctionne correctement mais qui peut être un peu lent par moment. J'ai vu mieux, et j'ai vu beaucoup pire."}
