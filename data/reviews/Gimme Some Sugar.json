{"text":"The only reason why I am giving this store 2 stars because it's very nicely decorated. I came in due to a last minute cake pop run for a 3 year olds birthday party. In desperate need, we tried to get the price lowered just a tad bit like a dollar or two, but no budge. We proceeded to by a dozen expensive cake pops only to be disgustingly disappointed by the taste. The appearance was lovely, but the taste was the opposite. Very bland cake, no flavor! Even the coating was plain tasting. Way too expensive and not good enough."}
{"text":"OMG, if I could stop at this bakery everyday I would be the size of a barn!  You wonderfully, wicked enchantresses keep compelling me for more!! You all are on my to do list every VEGAS visit!!

Where do I begin? I started my journey w/ this bakery back in 2013 after my scouting trip for my Vegas wedding.

I am from NYC the land of the Cronut Dominique Ansel Bakery, The Cake Boss-Carlos Bakery, the one bite cupcake - Baked by Melissa, and the ever so famous Magnolias so my pallet is quite versed in all that is sweet and honestly I am a hard costumer to win since my standards are through the roof. 

I found GSS via pinterest. From a picture of the cake I had to have. I contacted the bakery via email. I was responded to promptly, friendly happy to serve from Ashley. Months of planning  and a BAZILLON emails from a bride who ordered a cake and desserts site and taste unseen. A good amount of my food expense was on my dessert table because 1) I swore of all cake and desserts until I had wedding cake and 2) east coaster like their Venetian table. \"leave the gun, take the cannoli\"

My wedding day 10/18/14...Besides of marrying my love the best thing about my day was the CAKE and Mini Pastries!!! The taste of my custom 3 tier  Buttery,  Moist, Stuffed with sweet yummy cannoli filling, cake was to DIE for! I ate the left over cake for the entire week for breakfast, lunch and dinner!! I couldn't ship it home so we ate it!! Then the mini lemon meringue pies, OMG AHHH-MAZING!!! The naked cakes all my 40 guests luved them and the edible chambord mousse cups EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS!! You gals must have wands cause you sure do bake up magic and I am for sure under your spell! Oh did I mention how beautiful it all was to boot!!

My Husband and I went back to Vegas on 3/5/15. I rented a car, drove out to the shop just to meet with wonderful Ashley and staff who had made my day so perfect. I also had a birthday cake made for my husband and indulged in a Thin Mint  & Manly Macaron. Again, I was NOT disappointed!!! The thin mint, can we talk about the ganche?? Soft , chewy and Oohh so minty goodness! BIGGER IS BETTER where I come from and Man this sucker is a two hander!!  Unfortunately I have to settle on my few trips a year to Vegas for these yummy delightful perfections of wonder. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU for all the amazing sweets!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I've been in to this bakery four times.  The first time was great and the cookies hit the spot.  The second and third times I went in the cashier was rude and the cookies were overdone. Today was the fourth visit.  There were no cookies and when I asked I was told, \"not today.\" I had apparently interrupted the cashier and get friend's conversation. I don't care if the cookies were good.  I will never go to this place again.  Pretentious,  rude, and hit or miss on the treats. There are better places to go."}
{"text":"I am totally dissatisfied with the taste of my cake. I wasted 175.00 my dinner party for my daughter was ruined. No one like the cake. The cake was completely dry. Then lizie stated that their lemon cakes tend to be more dry. I wish I was informed of this prior to paying for my order. I would have never paid for a dry cake. I have this cake placed on my cake plate with a topper just to see if it would soften up...to no avail. The cream cheese was so heavy that the after taste...tasted like oil....I will not recommend this place to anyone do not waste your money..."}
{"text":"The place is adorable! And they serve booze! Looks like a great place to hang out in the evenings. I wanted to love everything about this place, but the cupcakes were dry...super disappointing.  I'll be back to give them a second chance, though..."}
{"text":"Any bakery that is by appointment only should not have a huge marquee and have posted on there doors that it is appointment only.  And then when you walk in look around confuse a man with a box of raw meat shouldn't treat you like a hobo looking for a place to squat"}
{"text":"Love this place! The deserts are absolutely beautiful and very delicious. They are a little too sweet for me but I always have a few bites and save the rest for a later snack. It's the perfect place to grab and espresso or champagne and a dessert to start the evening. I have never tasted their wedding cakes but they are some of the most beautiful I have ever seen I love looking at their Instagram as well!"}
{"text":"Here is yet another bakery that is not a place that you can stop by and purchase cupcakes or sweets on your way home from work or on your way to a party. 

The info listed on Yelp is misleading because although it gives business hours, they are not open to the public! 

I am looking for some cupcakes so I drove in my car to this location and there was a cute handmade sign on the door that said \"By Appointment Only\". While in the parking lot I called the phone number and somebody answered, but they said sorry not open to the public. Must make an appointment and place an order!  So annoying especially based on reviews! 

I give one star because of misleading yelp info. They need to specify by appointment only. Call ahead no matter where you go. Ask lots of questions."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would. In the beginning, there was a lot of confusion and miscommunication. Our caterer for our wedding was paying for our cake but they told gimme some sugar to give me whatever I wanted, no matter the price. Those were his exact words. Well at our tasting we agreed on a certain size cake. Good thing I sent an email just confirming things because gimme some sugar took it upon themselves to downgrade my cake to a smaller size because they felt I didn't need the size I wanted. Then they tried to play it off as if our caterer was the one that decided this, which was completely untrue. But whatever, I put that aside because I was very excited for them to make my cake. Well then comes my wedding day. The cake looks nothing like the picture I gave them. They assured me they could do what I wanted, but it looked like a cheap effort on their part. Then we cut into the cake, and SURPRISE, there was not one flavor that I picked!! I ended up going with red velvet and strawberry shortcake. Want to know what I actually got?! Pumpkin spice and lemon raspberry!!! Hmm interesting. Also, I have a severe nut allergy so what if one of the flavors they put in my cake that I didn't pick, had nuts in it? Clearly they didn't care!! I don't understand how a so called \"top rated\" bakery can mess up so royally!! Needless to say I will never be doing business with them again. And I will be sure to warn others. I know they make celebrity cakes, so maybe I just wasn't high profile enough? Well thank you gimme some sugar, for completely ruining my wedding cake! And another shocker, no response from gimme some sugar yet as to my dissatisfaction. They apologized to our caterer first, because you know, it was only OUR wedding. Basically they made up a bunch of excuses to cover their tracks. The only problem was their excuses didn't make sense, and when I came back with evidence that they were making things up to make themselves look better, they didn't really have anything to say."}
{"text":"If you have something planned, this is a great place to go.  If you have a sweet tooth and just want to drop in for a quick treat, expect to be treated like trash and only given a VERY limited selection.  The place is good, well decorated, but customer service is lacking!"}
{"text":"I emailed this letter to Gimme Some Sugar LV regarding my daughter's wedding cake. The owner responded about 45 minutes later stating that she delivered the cake and she left a brown cardboard box. She said they don't provide 4 inch boxes for the top tier cake...which her employees said they did provide a box for the top tier when we ordered. She said they have never had a problem with anyone cutting the cake. I feel like her phone call was argumentative and demeaning with a nasty demeanor. Shame on you!

To: Gimme Some Cake

On June 25, I came to your store to order a wedding cake. We told your employee that we wanted bling on the cake as well as ombre color. We pointed out the particular cake sample on your wall shelf that had a bling band around the bottom of the layers. More importantly, we requested the cake to be only two layers simply because we knew that a 3 layer cake for twenty people would look meager. We also informed your employee that took the order that we would need a special box delivered with the cake for the top layer because the bride would be carrying the top layer back to Atlanta on the airplane. Not to mention we needed a box to carry the cake out of the restaurant. Your employee assured us that you could provide us with the box. We were told by the restaurant where you delivered the cake that no box was provided when it was delivered. We are extremely disappointed with the lack of understanding and care for our order.

As cake professionals surely you would know that the scale of this cake would make it impossible to cut whole pieces for the traditional and treasured cake cutting wedding pictures. Our formal wedding cake knife and a regular knife did not have enough of an edge to properly cut, making  a complete mess of the cake cutting process. I have an attached of the image of your cake and you will notice that the cake was not properly designed for a wedding. 

I am aware that our order form clearly states 3 layers but we ask for two layers. As cake professionals you should know that that a 6\" 5\" 4\" cake would make it impossible to cut whole pieces. We had a $300 cake disaster to say the least. I feel that as a cake designer it is your duty to properly advise and design cakes appropriate for each unique occasion. Our cake was poorly designed and we were ill advised by your staff for our once in a lifetime occasion.
We are painfully disappointed with your service."}
{"text":"Hi Ashley, 
   Thank you for your response. During the day our experience has been fine. I think your night crew is not as polished. As I said, Gimme Sugar has excellent macaroons! We may be back. We will go during the day though when your service is better :-).

Thank you, 
Austin Gold"}
{"text":"If I could give them 10 stars, I would!

Every cake, cookie, and dessert is made with such creativity, originality and specified for each individual who orders to their desire. The quality is outstanding, not with only how it looks (which is gorgeous) but with the taste!!! 

I have tried many wedding cakes, I recently planned my wedding, and not only were most cakes dry, but the flavor was so artificial. 

Gimme Some Sugar's cakes are INCREDIBLE! They are moist and absolutely delicious! The flavor is so rich and delectable. 

It may be difficult to take a bite because it looks so amazing, but their cakes and desserts taste just as great as they look! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went here for a girls night, so cute! Quite a lot of traffic for a little place (because its worth it) and open late! Loved the atmosphere with the chandelier's and cute chairs, reasonably priced desserts and so delicious! You've got to try the Nutella macaroons!"}
{"text":"all i have to say is this place looks at people differently then big accounts. be careful i was given the run around until they turned around and said that they couldn't fulfill my order. very lack azeick and will not go out of their way to make the customer happy. they are in the lets make sweet and sweet are suppose to put smiles on our faces. i walked out of there with nothing no sweets or anything for that matter. pissed off at every single person. they will drop the ball if they choose so. not the way to run a business. SERVICE IS THE WORST FROM FRONT TO BACK!!!

 this will make for a negative PLUS posting."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my order! First I think they are WAY to expensive (luckily I had a Groupon for them so I only ended up spending $30 even though my order cost $54). I ordered 2 dozen cake pops for my daughters' birthdays. On their website the pops are cylindrical in shape, when I receives mine they were round (like the ones they advertise on tv. Ones I could have baked myself and saved money). Some of them did not have icing (which I think was white chocolate) covering all of it. The cake didn't seem to be cooked all the way, instead of being light & fluffy it was very dense. 
I'm not sure why I got such a shotty deal b/c I noticed they had a lot of great reviews.
The only thing I'll give them is we had no conflicts, they were pleasant to deal with (which was through email)"}
{"text":"Walking in feels like Alice in wonderland haha but nice little place. The manger is very friendly and treats are delicious."}
{"text":"I finally was able to try this place out, and it was amazing. Their desserts are fresh, and uniquely tasty. The macarons are soft, chewy and melt in your mouth. My favorite was the fruit eclair (I think that's what it was), it was delicious and fresh. I also had their coffee. Downside was their cappuccino small size was like an espresso (it was really strong too), recommend getting the large if you want more in your cup. Other than that it was good coffee. 
Sucks they're so far out (I live in Summerlin), if not I'd be there all the time."}
{"text":"I gave one star and it was generous. I was in talking to the front girl about their treats, since I saw them off the highway; and a lady (I'm guessing was the owner) came out and made the girl helping me talk to someone in the phone for a \"huge\" order. I'm guessing my couple of desserts wasn't important enough. Not to mention they aren't worth the time going in and getting. The cake part was dry and not very flavorful. Not a place I would go back. Rude service and not very good."}
{"text":"I am an admitted treat addict and with Gimme Some Sugar's late hours, delicious treats, and weekly changes to the offerings - I cannot stay away. Luckily, I have an understanding husband and friends that enjoy sitting in the shop with a sweet treat and a craft beer or coffee. 

My absolute favorite is the fig and goat cheese {oversized} macaroon. When I had tried macaroons previously, I thought they were a bit overrated - a fad that just wasn't for me. Then...my world was rocked. The macaroon was the perfect balance of hard outer shell, soft, moist interior and the heavenly filling of the goat cheese and fig compote. AMAZING. My husband enjoys their cheesecakes, blondies, and weekly specialties. 

Since my first taste, I have been a weekly customer. Usually choosing a new flavor of macaroon and always the fig and goat cheese (thankfully, that is a regular flavor.) You cannot go wrong with Gimme Some Sugar. 

Go in - get a treat (or two), sip a coffee, and enjoy the beautiful display of amazing cakes. These girls are so talented - you will be a regular too."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that is jut on a whole new level compared to the competition. The cakes they put out are almost too pretty too eat! and yes they are as delicious as they are beautiful. The designs for the cakes are amazing. just look at there portfolio. We had a suit case cake made and it looked like i could just open it up and pack. Sooooo realistic. The cake pops and all the little small goodies they make are equally if not more delicious than the cake. If there was a 6th star; i would give it to them"}
{"text":"Me and the fam were excited to try it w so many great reviews. It's a fancy place, it didn't feel like a bakery to me. I guess it's because their main focus are cakes. 

What we got:
Monster Cookie- It sounded good when she explained it to me, m&m's with PB and oatmeal w chocolate chips. (I know what was I thinking?) I took one bite and couldn't finish. Super dense and sweet w way too much PB

Choc/chip Macaroon - my kid got this, she didn't want to finish it which says a lot since she loves sweets. Me and my mom couldn't believe how sweet and gooey it was. No thanks.  Smaller macaroons would probably have a better texture & be more enjoyable....just my opinion.

Choc/Coconut frosted Cupcake - Kinda dry & the icing tasted artificial. I prefer Cupcakery or sprinkles at the linq no doubt.

No desire to go back for any baked goods they have. :/"}
{"text":"Gimme Some Sugar made our groom's cake for us. All I had was a picture of a baby shower cake that was the source of my idea, and Gimme Some Sugar just ran with it. They did an AWESOME job. My husband LOVED it. And not only did the cake look good, it tasted good. Very moist with a lot of flavor. The person who took my order gave me some suggestions that were different from mine, and I took her advice. I'm glad I did. A great bakery."}
{"text":"I ordered a 30th birthday cake for my girlfriend. It was really nerve wracking ordering a cake via email, but Ashley made the ordering process seamless. She answered all of my endless questions, offered suggestions, and eased my concerns. But about the cake...it was more than the birthday girl and I expected and warranted its own photo shoot from the invited guests. It was a Las Vegas 30th birthday themed cake complete with the sign, dice, poker chips, and a silver \"30\" the size of the cake! The best part is that it tasted as good as it looked. It tasted so good that the birthday girl brought the remaining cake back to NYC on the plane. THANK YOU to all whom had a hand in making her cake. It added so very much to the weekend."}
{"text":"Ordered my baby shower cake and goodies for a dessert bar from GSS. Let me just start by saying how blown away I was with how gorgeous my cake turned out. Kristen helped turn my vision into something even more beautiful then I could have imagined. It made for a beautiful centerpiece for the party. We also ordered a few dozen s'mores macs, chocolate chip cookies (my FAV!), and frosted sugar cookies shaped like blue bow ties. I only wish I had hid a few macs for myself for after the party because those went so quickly! 
If you haven't been to their location, you need to check it out. It's super cute, and a perfect place for date night. I can't wait to go in and enjoy a glass of champagne and one of their yummy desserts after this baby comes."}
{"text":"The customer service at this bakery is horrendous. I ordered a plain white cake for a party noting when I ordered it that I would be storing it over night and serving it the next day. When I went to pick up my cake, it was not plain white as requested but instead covered in chocolate drizzle and lumps. I was told by the ladies working that I could \"just scrape it off with a knife.\" They didn't even offer to help fix it. The box they wanted me to take the cake home in also didn't fit the size of cake I ordered, and wouldn't come close to closing shut. I was told it costs extra for a box that will actually close... What?!?!? Buyer beware."}
{"text":"My God. Those are damn good macaroons. 

I stopped here today to see what Gimme Some Sugar had and I just couldn't stop myself from buying 4...but was told if I bought 6, I'd get $0.50 off each macaroon. OK! - I'll take 6 then. AND I got a dollar off for visiting the first time and checking in on Yelp. - Thanks Yelp!  

$21 later I'm driving home and wondering how I'm going to eat all these ginormous King Kong sized macaroons... 

I'm going to try my best, dammit!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they opened.  The staff is always nice and professional.  This place is my go to place for sugar fix and get awat. The decor is so beautiful and I really enjoy hanging out and enjoying my sugar. The staff takes time with each customer, never any pressure. They remember you and really go out of their way to make you feel welcomed. Every time I get company from out of town, I take them there. 

I workout hard and go here for my cheat day. I look forward to the different goodness they create. My favorite thing to order. .. hum.. all of it. There is nothing they bake that I don't like. 

I love gimme some sugar."}
{"text":"Holy macaron!

This place serves up some seriously decadent macarons.  Bacon maple, birthday cake, goat cheese and fig, nutella and, my favorite, peppermint candy cane, are just some of the fancy flavors they have in stock.  And, they are HUGE, especially the peppermint candy cane.  It will take you several sittings to devour it.  And, it's delicious, if a tad too sweet.  Prices for these run from $3.50 to $4.50.

Also, other genius things about this place are: (1) it serves alcohol; and (2) It's open late.  Like, 11 p.m. late.   

I'll definitely go back to try more macarons, their moose domes, and cakes.  Everything looked amazing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for sweets!!!  If you haven't tried this place you're missing out.  Macaroons are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We were headed back from our trip to Boulder City and made sure to put this place and another bakery down the street on our list to stop at. As we all know, my appetite for baked goods has me on the constant lookout for new places. I might have a problem, I don't know.

If I can be honest, this bakery made no sense to me. I guess they are known for their fancy cakes, but when I walked in, they had a bunch of desserts. One section was higher priced fancier looking things and then another case had cupcakes and macarons and such. Then they also serve coffee. On top of that, they had croissants and scones. 

My advice would be to do what you're good at, which appears to be high end cakes. 

I tried a scone that was cheddar and bacon and chive because nothing looked that tempting to me as far as sweets. I will say, the flavor was good and it was nice to see a place that offered a couple savory items. Compared to the scones I have had, I didn't think the texture was quite right. Flavor. Good. Texture. Off.

My friend tried a croissant and honestly, it tasted like a decent grocery store croissant. It wasn't bad, but as I am about to get to, there is a place two blocks away that makes the best croissant I've ever tasted. These were a good try but they seemed to lack the right flakiness. 

Like I said, it appears that they make beautiful artwork when it comes to their cakes, but it felt like their retail items are just them trying to be everything to everyone."}
{"text":"I ordered a cake and desserts for my birthday from here and everything was beyond perfect! I frequent this bakery for any friends or family's birthdays and celebrations as I have never been disappointed. The staff is always very friendly and helpful. When choosing my desserts they helped me decide how many to order and suggested a wide variety. My guests all loved everything so much. Now onto the cake.... I had 2 tiers. A layer of s'mores and a layer of Luscious lemonberry! I had to eat 1 of each because everyone kept raving about how moist and delicious they were! And hey.... Calories don't count on your birthday right?? : ) the staff here are true artists. I would have never imagined my cake to be so beautiful. They got it perfect. Thank you Gimme Some Sugar!"}
{"text":"The most perfectly delectable macaroons I've ever tasted! The flavor a are amazing! My favorite, for now, strawberry lemonade! Their regular cookies are also delicious and the staff are extremely welcoming and helpful!"}
{"text":"You will NOT be disappointed by Gimme Some Sugar! You can tell by all the pictures how talented they are and how amazing the cakes look (you almost don't want to eat them!) but what you wouldn't believe is how great they taste! I have ordered 3 cakes from GSS the first being for my husbands 30th bday. He is not a cake fan but I knew he would be blown away from the look of the cake so I got one for him anyway. When I talked to Kristen she said they had a pumpkin pie cake and I knew I had to try it as it is my husband's favorite pie. He LOVED it and actually ate two pieces! All 3 cakes we have got from them were perfect and all of them amazed everyone who saw them! Could not give GSS enough compliments!"}
{"text":"Everything up to the point of my wedding went well.... the ladies are very on top of the whole ordering process and very nice to deal with. I wouldn't have even written a review except I feel like they could have been a little more apologetic  about delivering my wedding cupcakes late to my reception. I had all my guests sitting watching the assembly of my cupcake tower when they were to be delivered an hour before the reception was set to start. Then I get an email notifying me that I was late making final payment but since they neglected to call me to ask for payment they were going to wave any and all late charges.... Um, if GSS had called me right after my wedding I would have paid the balance in full so I really didn't understand the email letting me know how kind they were to wave late charges that would have been their issue to begin with since they neglected to phone me to get the balance after services were rendered. It was kind of like they wanted to write me and tell me how kind they were waving the late charges when it was their fault for not calling me sooner. When I emailed them back explaining that I was disappointed with how late the cupcakes were delivered all I got was a \"sorry\".... \"please call us as soon as possible and make final payment\".... not what I expected. Cupcakes were cute and tasted pretty good, from what I was able to taste.... a little pricey but that's the trend I guess. I was disappointed in their lack of remorse over the late delivery and their annoying email about neglecting to call me for payment, I think I should have at least received some kind of a peace offering."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never been to this shopping center before! I decided to stop by Gimme Some Sugar. It was a cute place, and the desserts looked good. I got their gluten-free brownie, and although it was very sweet, it was fairly good. I wanted to get some other things, but they had mainly unusual flavors/ingredients. I still like the basics, such as chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, raspberry, etc. and don't like things like bacon, Nutella and other things thrown into the mix. I do get that people are into these unusual flavors these days, but why not still have some standard flavors available, especially chocolate! The brownies were the only completely chocolate items there, and I was hoping to get a chocolate macaroon since the first and last time I had one was in Paris. I'll never forget it! The place was very clean, and the person at the front was great and happy to help you decide on a dessert."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars just for the macaroons! They are amazing and I've tried almost every flavor. However the 3 stars is because their cupcakes and cake are pretty awful. Dry, bland and just not good. I expected a lot more from a bakery that specializes in cakes. I see from other reviews that this is a common theme, disappointment in the dry and flavorless cake so I would hope they would take note and make some changes. The speciality desserts are hit and miss. Some are really yummy and some are not so good. The sugar cookies are great, but the vegan cookies are extremely chewy and not the best vegan cookie I've ever had. Unlike most of the other reviews, I haven't ever really had a problem with the staff."}
{"text":"Love the kitsch aspect of the store. Very trendy and fashion-forward. Their sweets are good though, but not as \"gourmet\" as they represent. I found their tiramisu cup really dry and I wish they'd make their desserts more traditional rather than have be like every one else with fondants and fusion. Don't get me wrong, their Caramel Apples are perfect."}
{"text":"IF I could give this place a ZERO rating I would.  In May I ordered a birthday cake for my 1 year old daughter. It was a really good cake and nothing was wrong with it. Everything went according to plan. It was a little bit overpriced but it was cute so I don't care.

The next month in June however was a totally different  story. It was my son's 5th birthday this time and since I liked the cake I was hoping to get another cake from them for his 5th birthday. I place an order over the phone for June 24th it was on a Wednesday. (my son loves Spiderman so I ordered him a Spiderman cake)

 The lady who took my order which I don't know her name confirmed everything with me and told me it will be ready in the morning of June 24th. My husband goes there that morning and they told him that the cake won't be ready till Friday. Which I don't understand because I ordered it for Wednesday. 

The lady in charge told me there must have been a miscommunication, that i gave her the wrong date..... (because you know i dont know my sons birthday....) and said nothing else. She was actually quite rude about it while I was on the phone with her she was taking orders from other people who were in line at her store and put me on hold four times.

When it was convenient for her to actually talk to me the only thing that she could offer me was either a refund or only 10 percent off on some cupcakes. 

I was devastated because this was my 5 year old son's birthday and I didn't want him to not have a cake. I asked her about the cupcakes and if we could make them spiderman themed with some fondant cutouts or something and she told me that she could only do basic cupcakes a regular vanilla cupcake with some red and blue frosting... 

I couldn't believe it first you make the mistake of putting the wrong date on my order and then you're going to offer me only 10 percent off for some basic cupcakes and won't even take the time to add a couple of fondant cut outs or something to make them more Spiderman themed?

I said screw it and ask for a refund and the refund didn't even come to me until a WEEK later so let's say for example if I didn't have the money to get another cake my son would have not had a birthday cake. This is the worst customer service I've ever had with ANY store. I will be sure to never come to the store again. 

And I will never recommend this bakery to anybody. In fact I make sure to tell people my experience with this bakery."}
{"text":"I just moved into this area. This cute hidden gem is a great place to catch coffee and a quick desert!!  Brenda was awesome and very personable!!! hours are great too!!! Try it out!!"}
{"text":"The best cake designers in town!  These girls can create anything!  I've ordered from them several times and am always amazed by the outcome.  They created an Alice in Wonderland themed wedding cake to accompany wine for my blog post, \"What wine pairs with wedding cake?\" on my blog QuitWINEing.com.  It was incredible, in addition to being light and tasty.  Check these ladies out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Gimme Some Sugar does it all!

My fiance and I had our first experience with GSS for our wedding cake tasting. We met with Ashley and she was a delight. She was so upbeat and genuine. She seemed as excited as we were. She had some great selections for us and was oepn to each of our ideas. The cakes themself are just amazing, They are light and the fillings are delicious. You can tell that Ashley and Kristen love what they do. 

The Mrs. then surprised me with my very own themed birthday cake!! It looked amazing and tasted twice as good as the design came out. Our group of people were astonished at how good it was. We ate the entire thing! The wedding is two months away now and we cannot wait to see how our cake is going to look, we already know how great it is going to taste. 

Being that my fiance and I live in Henderson and had such a wonderful experience with them for the tasting we were anxious to find out that they were opening The Bake Shoppe. This meant that we could get our hands on their treats ANYTIME WE WANTED!

They have put together one of our favorite late night hang outs. The Mrs. goes there for the wine and i can't get enough of their Macarons. They have mastered the art of making them. We drop by every time we see that they have come out with a new combination and we truly enjoy stopping by after a great dinner. We don't even bother with ordering desserts from whatever restaurant we ate at!

They have a great set up. The music, the environment, the drinks and desserts. I am love this place and love them! 

Gimme Some Sugar is a must for everyone!"}

Everything I've tried is delicious."}
{"text":"Not super impressed. The selection in store no where near matched what I saw here on Yelp. I came in late afternoon on a Saturday. Maybe the inventory was low, who knows. I got the peanut butter blonde which was good but I was not happy with the 12oz cappuccino I ordered. It was super tiny, like just a shot. I asked the lady if it was only supposed to fill up half the cup & she said yes, it's espresso with foam. Okay I understand that but if I'm paying $3.25 for 12oz, I want 12oz. The way it's made shouldn't have anything to do with the quantity, right?"}
{"text":"Every time I bring my family to Gimme Some Sugar it is the biggest treat! The desserts are amazingly delicious and always beautiful - like ART beautiful. 

While we got married long before these amazing ladies were in business - and so we did not have the opportunity to delight my guests with one of their jaw-droppingly creative custom cakes - I've seen them in magazines, at parties, at celebrity birthday bashes on my Instagram feed, and gracing the walls of their fashionably designed cafe in Henderson. 

And I am not exaggerating when I say that these ladies are artists. They truly are infinitely creative sculptors who create unique, meaningful, centerpiece cakes for their custom cake clients.

They really are top-shelf, the very best you can hope for.

Did I mention, they're also wonderfully giving and charitable? I once asked the ladies if they could help our Boy Scout Troop in its annual Christmas donation to St. Judes For Children out in Boulder City. St. Judes takes in children and moms who are fleeing domestic violence environments - they are all saints out there. We were hoping for a few cupcakes or cake pops or something. Instead, the Gimme Some Sugar ladies baked a tear-jerkingly gorgeous custom Christmas cake. The kids and moms and the whole Scout Troop were floored by their generosity and creativity.

If you're looking for excellence, and stunningly talented creativity in your custom cakes and baked delicacies, ya gotta go with Gimme Some Sugar."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have amazing macaroons in a variety of fun flavors. This time I tired something new, a Peanut Butter Chocolate and Bananna Cheesecake! Absolute Heaven in your mouth."}
{"text":"SOOOOOO PRETTY! 
   Really a gr8 find in Henderson just off the freeway @ the Stephanie exit. 
   All different type of treats, cookies, HUGH macaroons in many assorted flavors, savory scones, sweet scones, tropical flavored delicacies, chocolate desserts! REALLY!!! even sugar free & gluten free options.
    The black & white walls with nicely showcased cakes samples, comfortable chairs, spectacular lighting....as u can tell I 'd the space. 
    Open till midnight PLUS they offer champagne, wine & beer along with coffee, lattes, cappuccinos .
    All the servers which we had were sooo polite, helpful couldn't have been any more pleasant especially the gal who took our order & made our coffees. The ONLY I might recommend would be to serve coffee drinks in actual cups opposed to TO GO cups~ however that is a minor, very minor issue for me."}
{"text":"All sugar, no flavor. Tried this place out about a month ago. Quaint decor, nice ambiance. Ordered a snickers and pumpkin macaroon. We each took one bite and literally left. It was all sugar. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Great place if your craving great coffee and good deserts"}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this bakery! When ever friends come to visit it's a must I bring them by to try their Macaron's they have such out of the box types of deserts which makes them so refreshing. I love going around girl scout cookie times they buy a bunch of boxes them make macaron flavors based on the cookies, the caramel delights are my favorite and a must try. If your a fan of nutella oh they have macaron's with that flavor as well. This place is such high quality with reasonable prices. the macaron's are huge too! I always grab a few cupcakes and cookies for the kids when i stop in and they love them. The bakery is very nicely decorated and always clean. The dark haired lady that works in there everytime ive been in there is friendly and always tell you to let her know if you have any questions. I would recomend them to anyone who is looking for great deserts to take out or eat in. I wish my daughter was still little this would be a place i would take her to for a tea party!!"}
{"text":"Not only is this a bakery that you can stop in and pick up item to go but you can dine in. They are open late for a bakery and that's because this is a popular little spot to have a glass of wine and dessert with your friends. 

Strawberry cheesecake- very pretty and yummy. When you first bite into it, it tastes like strawberry ice cream. The crust has very strong taste and is delicious. I like that you taste more strawberries than just regular cheesecake with a couple strawberries on top. 

Confetti cupcake- looks more like a homemade cupcake then the fancy cupcakes you would find in another bakery but I was disappointed. I think homemade cupcakes are the best and always super moist. This one was the opposite. Dry and the frosting didn't have much flavor.

Brownie- delicious! Extremely rich so you can easily share. My favorite item there. 

Sugar cookie with frosting- I have to say, it's the best sugar cookie I've found in Vegas. (Trust me, I'm picky!) it's not super soft like the ones you buy in the grocery store and it's ten times better."}
{"text":"I never thought of myself as being \"spoiled\"  living in LA, but finding amazing food has been quite the challenge since I've been staying here in Henderson. While trying to replace my fantastic baker in Whittier i found this Trendy desert bar looking place that almost looked out of place in its strip mall (should prob be on the strip). the girl working there was nice, super helpful, knowledgeable about the place and the stuff in it, so 2 stars for that. The macaroons were great so a star for that, and 1 star because I'm eager to come back. I didnt get to try the cupcakes since they have different types daily and they had some weird ones today(vegan, peanut something, something else fancy)."}
{"text":"Definitely must have a super-sweet tooth to really enjoy the sugary sweet confections here at Gimme Some Sugar...hockey puck sized macarons ( I apologize, I called them macaroons in another review...it's not those coconut cookie thingys, they're the meringue type cookie thingys)

I tried the Manly Macaron ( had me at bacon in the description...), it was really  good. More sweet than savory (more bacon, please), smoky, crunchy, caramely goodness. There was a hint of alcohol in the cream (bourbon?), like I said, didn't read the ingredients past bacon...

Okay, the giant macarons are on-point, but maybe bring your insulin (just in case...). If macarons aren't your thing, they have a whole array of delicious looking cookies, brownies, cupcakes and other single serve desert items on display (no, really, they all look good...cue Homer Simpson in Candyland). As if that wasn't enough, they serve alcohol! So, get your sweet on and get your drink on."}
{"text":"Put simply - our wedding cake was stunningly beautiful and absolutely delicious. Gimme Some Sugar was such a pleasure to work with in every way possible. We'd highly recommend them to anyone and everyone, especially the discerning/type-A/particular bride."}
{"text":"Bomb macaroons!!!! So many different flavor options to pick from....my fav was the cookie butter macaroon!!! Definitely a place to check out....a lot of cute desserts."}
{"text":"A bakery that also serves alcohol? I'm in trouble! This place has all your favorite vices: indulgent sweets, quality wines, and even savory scones. If you have a crack habit, I'm pretty sure it's baked into the delicate, double-layer fruit Pavlova. 

This is also the only place you'll find macarons the size of your palm- higher price, lessened opportunity to try multiple styles, but the flavors are spot-on! The popular ginger-fig has been a bit elusive, but the strawberry-lemonade has ample, balanced notes of each, plus a smear of jam in the middle. 

Everything in the cases looks like a work of art. On the downside, they're priced like art, too- $5.25/macaron, $7 for that tiny but tasty Pavlova. Great spot for a special occasion, like a Girls Night Out or a birthday meetup with friends, but not an easy spot to visit regularly."}
{"text":"I think the name of their shop is my catch phrase!  It's also my new favorite place for a treat!

We stopped in one evening to fulfill my sweet tooth.   We walked into a contemporary designed shop that is right up my alley.   Beautiful with pops of color from their towering cake designs.   

We were helped by an amazing lady with eagerness and personality beyond compare.  She informed us about this wonderful little shop with tidbits about their items.   We decided on the vanilla bean cheesecake and tiramisu.  I didn't plan on getting a macaron because here's the kicker...  I've never had one before.  Crazy?  Yes, I must have been.  Upon mentioning this to her she threw in one for free for me to try.  How nice is that?! 

We didn't stay there to eat our treats but rushed home to try them all.  Insanely great is all I can say about the macaron.  Being a macaron virgin, I can't compare it to anyone else.  I will say it was one of the best desserts I had ever had.   The light and airiness that surrounded the filling touched every taste bud with extreme delight!

As for the other desserts, fabulous as well.  They went way above the competition.  The cheesecake was creamy with the vanilla bean infused flavor.  Yum.  Tiramisu is another favorite treat of mine that they have also perfected.  They have their mastered their craft here.

With the utmost top customer service, clean contemporary shop and fabulous desserts, I just don't know if it can get any better than this."}
{"text":"Notice on door says locks are changed due to delinquent payment.  Dated 5/9 which would put it the day I was last in here. Either Im a glutton for punishment trying all the artificial stuff or I really wanted to have this place succeed with new owners. I asked if there was anyone making cakes on premises, reply was \" it's done at industrial?\" Last visit stuff in case looked stale, banana filling brown on one cake, I got a stale cronut..thought I would give them one more try... but oh well! 


Too bad and sad and annoyed for the new owners who took over this place. No further comment.. 

Anyways if you like coffee, they have it at Mothership Coffee Roasters. 

The breads according to Majesty Bakeries website, you can find it at COSTCO or WinCo. 

For macarons, check out the new sweets place in town, Sweets 507/Michelle by Sweets 507

Looking for the awesome cakes and GSS creations? Look up Kristen the former owner and Cake artist over at Masterpiece Cake Studio on Water Street here in Henderson.. she's still rockin out awesome cakes  check her IG account."}
{"text":"European buttercream...

My very first job was at a German bakery in Costa Mesa CA & during that experience I gained a lot of weight and learned all about the finest ingredients around. I'm a super snob when it comes to bakeries & how could you not be after being around the best. 

This place is really chic & looked like it belonged at The Cosmo. We came in late so decided to take a few things to go. I can't resist a good looking vanilla cupcake & my man settled on a brownie. The very nice owner looked at how tall he was & gave him a free brownie as well. Before we walked out the owner also told us to pick out any bread we wanted on the house after learning it was our first visit. How nice!

Big shout out to the owner Velvet who was super sweet and a Miami hottie. I couldn't wait to dig into my cupcake and the buttercream was just the way I remembered it to be...divine! I am definitely down to drive across town for anything this good...

I also fell in love with the contemporary chandeliers and am going to get my own for my closet. Brownie was good but didn't blow me away and I did try the bread which was awesome as well & perfect for any type of sandwich."}
{"text":"Such a fun place. Tried a brownie and a snickerdoodle. Super yummy. Can't wait to come back on a date night. Craft beer and wine pairings with fancy desserts? Yes please!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to macarons by a work friend and my sweet tooth was craving them badly. A quick search on yelp showed me this place with highest reviews, so I went. Its located on Stephanie and 215, and it could be hard to find. Just look for a laser tag and miniature golf plaza and its located on the right side.

I got three different things; two fig and goat cheese macaron, one mint and chocolate and one snicker doodle cupcake (see pics). All of them were delicious, specially the fig & goat cheese macaron. The cupcake was moist and the frosting just melted in my mouth. I would highly recommend checking out this place if you are craving something sweet."}
{"text":"A shout out to this wonderful baker for making cupcakes for our fifth grade promotional ceremony at Estes Mcdoniel.  If you haven't tried this place not only are all the sweats delicious the atmosphere is gorgeous!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am a BIG fan of sweets. Like, I've developed type 2 diabetes kind of sweet tooth; seriously I now have type 2 diabetes.  Gimme Some Sugar is one of my favorite spots to go for something sweet. They have a varied selection but seem to focus on their variety of macaroons. Also serving up cookies, cake pops, marshmallow bars, cupcakes as well as your higher end (fancy) types of pastries & custom cakes. 
Everything I have had here was good but I typically get a macaroon. They have several that are standard flavors that they keep year around but they also have a few that they change regularly so there is something new to try.  They make caramel in house and it is pretty freaking amazing, so I would recommend that to anyone who was visiting for the first time.  As for the cookies, cupcakes and cake pops, they are well made and tasty but how much can I elaborate on that?

I should also mention that this establishment is creative. They serve wine, beer, (I think, beer) have an espresso machine and some tea sachets.  You can sign up for events to decorate pastries with friends while drinking wine and enjoying each others company. I come here for the dessert since I'm not a huge drinker and I am not a big fan of their coffee.  
To sum it up, this is a cozy, well decorated place to come with friends and enjoy dessert together. I come for the macaroons mostly and I stay because it's a relaxing environment with a friendly staff. Definitely check it out if you're looking for a late night sugar fix."}
{"text":"Boyfriend brought a box of assorted goodies home but everything seemed to taste the same and I guess it was too sugary and you couldn't tell the difference between each dessert since the sugar overpowered the flavors"}
{"text":"I hate to be writing such a poor review, but I would just like to share the experience I went through at my wedding. My new husband and I got married this past Saturday at a spectacular venue called Dragon Ridge in Henderson. Everything was wonderful except for my wedding cake, which was ordered at Gimme Some Sugar.

Our cake came with our wedding package and we are in no way shape or form blaming Dragon Ridge for our cake. We had a tasting at GSS prior to the wedding and the cakes that they let us sample were very dry. My wedding planner was very clear about requesting a MOIST cake for the day of the wedding and even asked the staff member to highlight that we would like a MOIST cake in their notes. 

On our wedding day the cake was very beautiful but during our cake cutting ceremony, the tiny bite I tried was very DRY. I asked my guests to be honest with me about the cake and they told me it was DRY! My wedding planner even felt the cake in her hands and it was so DRY that it crumbled to pieces! 

This was very disappointing and what could have been a perfect and gorgeous wedding even better was if we could have had a good tasting cake. This was very embarrassing to me because my brother mentioned in his speech to me that I was the best dessert chooser and that I know my sweets. :( Well I know for certain that the cake GSS made for our wedding did not meet our standards. I feel bad for writing this review but I just want people to know that they may want to reconsider ordering their wedding cake from GSS even if it comes with their wedding package. 

Luckily I ordered a surprise grooms' cake from Peridot Sweets which was very moist, delicious and worth paying for!"}
{"text":"I've had their giant macaron and their cardamom cheesecake! I love that they try to create unique flavors like such . It was okay but nothing to crave for. BUT the macaron was great ! Oh so perfectly chewy and HUGE! And only for $3.50!' Good deal '"}
{"text":"This is the first dessert place that I can honestly give a super strong 5 stars to.  So good.  I have been there a handful of times... Every time I go, the desserts are decadent, amazing, divine.  I could go on and on about what I ate but honestly, you have to eat them to understand.  

Just a note: I am a chocoholic so most everything I have ordered has been chocolate.  That being said, their caramel is crazy good.  They make it themselves and if you can find something with caramel on it, I would recommend it.  They know what they are doing and actually put out amazing desserts.  The service is fantastic, too.  The nice lady behind the counter actually remembered me and made reference to what I had ordered before.  

Hope they stay in business for a long time... at least as long as I live in the area!"}
{"text":"I think the shop itself is modern and nice and the pastries are good as well. I'm a sucker for their chocolate chip cookies. Unfortunately, they don't always have a huge variety of pastries. They have pretty good macarons though! (I love the fig and goat cheese one!!) The only down side is that their pastries are kind of pricey."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Henderson I try to visit this place. We got a strawberry lemonade and pistachio macaroon. We also got a chocolate, bananas and marshmallow eclair. I have to say everything was so delicious. The shoppe was decorated so classy and the staff was friendly. We will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in to see my friend's new shop. Sampled the custard chocolate Cronut, which is croissant dough fried up like a donut. It was incredible. Frosting was perfect - not overly sweet and it tasted like good chocolate; not poor quality chocolate made from confection sugar. Also, sampled the sweet bread rolls - bigger and better than King's. Stop by for a pastry, coffee, a custom cake, or even wine/beer."}
{"text":"I ordered a cake for a friend's birthday and really wanted to make it special.  (all on short notice btw).  I gave them some general parameters and left it in their hands.  I was surprised and delighted with what they created- it was not only beautiful, detailed, and had correct proportions-- it was way bigger than I expected!  The cake was dense and moist, and the filling was rich, luxurious and full of flavor.  I will definitely order another cake from them- and no, they are not exactly cheap, but neither are any other 'famous' bakeries in town, which i have also ordered from - and I fully believe in 'you get what you pay for'.  Totally worth it- and i just learned that they have a full open bakery now so I'm going to hit them up for pastries and holiday goodies next.  I'm not baking this year!!"}
{"text":"When I was looking for a unique Coffee and pastry shop..definitely this place drew me in with beautifully decorated space. But that's all! I got the Decaf Americano coffee and tiramisu (which is one of my fav desserts). The lady did not make me a decaf which I can tell. I started feeling jittery. Wasn't too impressed with the taste. The tiramisu was ok. It had a funny after taste to me. When going to a specialty place...the items they serve should be better because you're paying extra for that. I prob won't go in there again. I didn't feel warm and fuzzy. Instead i felt cold and unfriendly.   I was going to give 2 stars but gave it 3 because of how beautifully the place was decorated."}
{"text":"We purchased our cake from Gimme Some Sugar and were satisfied with the results. 

The cake was stunning and exceed our expectations. The number of choices available for which cake and combinations you can have in regards to flavors and colors is awesome. 

The taste testing left us with some very difficult choices to make because we wanted all of them. 

Almost everything was perfect, we had two cake choices, red velvet and cookies & cream. 

The only thing that didn't exceed expectations was that numerous guests told us that the red velvet cake did not taste right. At first we thought it was only the drunk guests that felt this way, but then we tried it ourselves and a few sober people said the same thing. Tasted like something was off or missing, it did not taste like the red velvet we tried during the taste testing. We ended up throwing away most of the red velvet. 

Had this been the case for both cakes, we'd have had an issue, but the other cake was perfect and greatly received. We're sure it's not something that happens often and the wedding was awesome so we didn't complain about it because stuff happens. 

We would choose these guys again."}
{"text":"I got a red velvet cupcake. It's the worst cupcake that I've ever had. Cake was very stale and dry. Icing was waxy- after one bite I threw it away. I'm so upset I spent $3.50 for nothing."}
{"text":"Super cute inside! A little pricey but what you pay for for fancy treats!  Cookies were soft and yummy!  Service was great, the gal that helped us was super helpful and nice!

Will definitely be back to take the rest of the family.  Cute place to take girlfriends.  They have a reverse happy hour for a dessert and drink for $14.

And if you order a cookie with ice cream they bake one fresh!"}
{"text":"This bakery is near my home, so I finally decided to stop in and try it.  The products look beautiful, and the staff was very helpful and friendly.  That is the end of what was positive.  There were very few of any one item, so I decided to choose two of this and two of that.  Here are the comments from my friends and family.  The cake pop was under done, cookie tasted like baking powder, carrot cake was dry, and the kronuts were tasteless and not real kronuts.  No one even wanted to sample the remaining items, and they will, unfortunately, go in the trash after spending close to $50.   I rarely buy pastries, so when I do, I'd like to enjoy it.  Local supermarkets have better pastries at a fraction of the price.  Needless to say, I won't return to Gimme Some Sugar, and I'm still perplexed at how they received a \"Best of Las Vegas\" award."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try today. My daughter had the Nutella macaroon and I had the peanut butter blondie. The macaroon was a five, but the blondie was really dry. Good flavor though. I would still recommend this place and will be back to try something else. Everyone has a bad blondie day every now and then, right?"}
{"text":"Wanted something extra special for our daughter's 3rd birthday party. Went into the store to ask about a custom order and the woman behind the counter acted like I was bothering her. Was willing to spend good money, we got our girl a pony for her friends to ride on for crying out loud, but this woman was so off putting. Took my business elsewhere.

I remembered this place being so friendly and having beautiful cakes on the walls. Not the place it once was."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try Gimme Some Sugar  because they bake two of my true loves - macaroons and cupcakes. When I got to the store, the only lady working was on the phone. She didn't acknowledge me or anything, and left me waiting for at least 3 minutes. I wanted to try a couple of cupcakes before I ordered a bunch for a baby shower I'm hosting. All they had on hand was vanilla and Nutella. I ordered both flavors and also got a thin mint macaroon. 

I ate the macaroon immediately. It was super sweet. It didn't have an amazing filling.. it was just buttercream and maybe ganache. There was also a thin mint inside, which was cool.

The cupcakes were consumed later by myself and three of my friends. They were awful. Dry and dull. There was no hint on Nutella in the Nutella cupcake. The frosting was overly sweet. I definitely don't recommend these guys for cupcakes. Maybe they do cake better?

Bad service combined with grocery store products - I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to visit. The sweets are a little too sweet but still enjoyed it. Pastries on my scale are a 2 out of 10. Would I go back? Yeah maybe for just coffee. Love the idea of the place but I myself enjoy balances sweets. Just my opinion. Keep on working hard!"}
{"text":"I've ordered several cakes from Gimme Some Sugar and have not been disappointed! The latest was my daughters baby shower cake; it was elegant and exactly what she wanted. They even molded a beautiful sleeping baby on the top of the cake - everyone was taking pictures. They couldn't get over how beautiful it was. I initially found them after emailing 5 bakeries - they answered immediately - and did exactly what we wanted. I was receiving responses from the other bakeries 2 days later! Ashley at Gimme Some Sugar always responds immediately and I've given her some challenges and she's met every one. Most importantly, the orders were ready on time, looked incredible and tasted awesome. I'd highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Idk what happened. If it is new ownership they have a lot to learn"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place, attempted to go on Saturday. Yelp says the place is open until 10pm on Saturdays, and we arrived 9pm. There were no lights on, and the sign was off, and their sign says they are open until 10pm. Would have loved to try the place, but their hours are apparently a lie."}
{"text":"First off, I'm a big sweet tooth addict you name it I love it all! 

I started following this bakery on IG even before I moved here and I knew I would get around to it eventually since it is close to our house and I can't go very long without some type of sugar in my life!

Maybe coming in on Christmas Eve (early afternoon) wasn't great since the product was not up to par at all. When we first walked in we saw the pretty décor and wondered if that was a coverup for subpar product (reminds of Casey's Cupcakes, beautiful on the inside but the product doesn't live up to the décor)

We were greeted by a nice employee however, there was another employee that totally ignored us and went into the back. Way to make a good first impression on new customers?!

I mainly came into the bakery since I saw on IG they had Gingerbread cookies and my mom had been craving them for such a long time, we saw the cupcakes and ordered one of each ( vanilla/confetti and carrot) I also ordered a snickerdoodle cookie.

Two cupcakes, 2 gingerbread cookies and one snickerdoodle cookie for $12.00 meh typical pricing. I don't ever complain when it comes to the price except when the product isn't good. The saving grace were the cookies, they were delicious and super soft! 

I didn't like how the employee put our cookies in the same carton as the cupcakes, by the time we got home they were messed up :/ Most places have a special holder  for the cupcakes and separate other goodies from the cupcakes.

The presentation of the vanilla cupcake was lame, it reminded me of a box cake mix and tasted like it too, I didn't feel it was homemade, I didn't taste any vanilla, just the confetti. The cake was dry and the icing was just OK. I didn't try the carrot one but my mom said the same thing, it was lacking flavor. 

Maybe this bakers weren't on their A- game since it was Christmas Eve but it just wouldn't be enough to bring me back again.

:/"}
{"text":"This business is extremely unprofessional! I purchased three dozen cupcakes for my daughter in laws baby shower. Paid for my order on May 7th the party was May 14th when I arrived to pick up my order. The business was closed with a notice stating the locks were changed for non payment of back rent. Needless to say I was extremely upset because this establishment was locked out two days after I paid for my order. I did not receive a phone call, text or email. That they would not be able to fulfill my order. Proceed with caution if you are going to work with this bakery."}
{"text":"Gimme Some Sugar has opened a dessert bar/bakery in Henderson.  It was opening day and the baked goods and treats were ready.  The place appears to serve desserts, coffee, and wine (not sandwiches/bread).  They don't open very early (11:00 am) and stay open up into the evening.  It would be a nice place for a casual date, conversation with friends, or an after movie/theatre/church snack. The owners might have come up with a nice niche for their business and hopefully it works because the desserts appear awesome.

The  service was very friendly and the pastry I  had (chocolate brownie/chocolate chip cookie) were really yummy.  The pastry looked like super quality stuff and from what I saw prices ranged from about $3 for cookies/brownies to $4 for very unique macarons to about $7 for very high-end cake desserts.  The more pricey desserts looked big enough to share with a date, spouse, or significant other.

The shop has about ten tables and is nicely decorated and clean.  It has a classy-artsy-bistro feel but is mellow with cool music.  It's tucked away in the corner of a strip mall at 215 and Stephanie, but it is not hard to find."}
{"text":"When in the mood for great dessert, this is the place. The great part is a majority of their desserts are Gluten free. If undecided on what to get, you cannot go wrong with any of the macaroons, they are the best in town!!!!! Also the cakes that they are designing are out of this world. And don't be scared of the vegan chocolate chip cookie it is amazing. Everything is fresh and no preservatives, so don't be mad if they sell out of something and don't have back ups. Also they carry a large selection of wines. High quality, great taste, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Did they strategically place their shop in the same vicinity as a gym? if so, BRILLIANT!

Even if they were miles away from any type of calorie burning facility, I'd gladly visit this place to acquire their luscious sweets (and maybe a few extra lbs).

I've visited this place 4 times so far and have tried mini cheesecakes, dirt cups, tiramisu, monster cookies, macarons, blondies, and decorated sugar cookies. Nothing has been disappointing.

The décor just adds to the giddy feeling you get when you walk in. Your senses are dazzled by the smells, sights and tastes. The gals behind the counter are always friendly and patient. 

I have never tried their special occasion cakes but there are sample cakes that are shelved throughout their store, and they look absolutely beautiful.

Love this place and can't wait to coordinate a girls night to try dessert and wine pairings! Best part-they're open late!"}
{"text":"Do I give it 3 stars? Do I give it 4? Usually if I can't decide I go with the lesser until they have proven me wrong. I think eventually I will up this review a star. But based on my first experience we will start with average. 
All of my yelp friends always talk about this place, check in, post pics, and its so close to me house! Finally after work one night I had a sweet tooth and stopped in. 
Off top, 5 stars for décor and customer service. I love the old school classy barber shop, winery, ladies saloon style all in one. I was instantly greeted with a smile and a hello. Lighting was dim, but appropriate. 
I was instantly drawn to the berry mascarpone cake. 2 of my favorites in one. $7 for a small piece, I was disappointed. Not enough mascarpone and it was like a berry gelatin. Not bad, but not what I expected. 
I took home, chocolate covered strawberries (3 for $6, decent), cookies, macaroons, and a couple other randoms. Prices were ok. 
I could imagine myself loving this place and enjoying a glass of wine n cupcake after work entirely to often. Who's my first yelp date down for drinks and desserts?! Jessie B? Shirley B?"}
{"text":"After going to the gym next door, I decided to stop by Gimme Some Sugar (set back my workout progress but so worth it!) and did not regret that decision.  I ordered the tiramisu cake at $5 for a cup of it.  Most tiramisu that I've tried have a very moist texture similar to tres leches cake, but the tiramisu here was much more light and airy, and it was delicious.

I love the atmosphere of the bakery too.  The furniture and decor look very upscale, and the bakery still feels welcoming at the same time.  Customer service is top notch too.  It was cool to look at the many custom cake displays set out throughout the bakery.  

I came back to Gimme Some Sugar today, and tried the large thin mint macaron, at the recommendation of the lady at the counter.  The macaron was the size of burger buns and reasonably priced at $4.95 for such a huge piece.  This macaron was amazing!  The taste was very similar to thin mint cookies, and there were real thin mint pieces inside with the cream filling.  The texture of the cookies was great and the cookies were not hollow, unlike many other macarons I've tried in the past."}
{"text":"So now the director of operations emails me to email her about my review. My point was this less than mediocre rating bake shoppe has zero personal attention when it comes  to the customer and she proved it. Just read her response to the review and the snapshot of her response to me. Lol! It's ok director! My daughters birthday cake was ordered and discussed personally with someone right on the bake shoppe premises that I went to.The bake shoppe is Showboy in Anthem and they earned my business the right way. Personal service is the way to earn business when it comes to this industry. The reason why your place is dead all the time is because ether incompetent people working there and just quite possibly your lack of caring. I am in constant contact with media and people who can give you plenty of business, FYI I will never ever recommend this place ever. You'll be closed soon..."}
{"text":"They did our custom Harley wedding cake way back in 2009 and most recently a birthday cake. The skill level is AMAZING and the cake itself is super moist and delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went to this business a few months ago for a cake and was really delicious done a great job and hit the nail on the head with the design of the cake as well as the flavor and was also done on time for my birthday party for my little girl cake tasted amazing went back there again today for some cookies and cake pops and they were amazing of course will definitely recommend this company to all my friends"}
{"text":"I kept seeing this place coming out of the gym (dangerous place to put a bakery), and was curious. I love baked goods, so trust me when I say I had to stop myself from going multiple times. I was doing a small party for a friend, and finally had a reason to go in and see what was up.

First off, this place is adorable. Very creative cakes all around, clean, and just a general good vibe. There wasn't any customers, and one staff. I told her that I wanted to order some desserts for a small party in a couple weeks. She was very helpful and told me about all the different desserts they had. I ended up choosing a little bit of almost everything, which she wrote on an order form, and I was on my way.

Fast forward two weeks, and I come in to pick up my order. The same girl is working, and she informs me that somehow, someone took the order form she had made, and threw it away. Hm, okay. Well, I'll just pick from what's in the display case, it can't be too different. I honestly don't remember each thing I ordered, but I do remember that some of them were no longer in the case. Bummer.

Overall, the consensus at the party was that they were all a little too sweet. That may be a taste preference, but when my husband (who inhales candy and soda) says the macaroon was too sweet, that's saying something. I can only rate the desserts I had (mini cheesecake, chocolate ganache, mini tarts, some kind of passion fruit thing, macaroons, cake pops), not their cakes or other items. 

For the high price, and the \"hype\" on yelp, I guess I expected more. I may come back if I need a beautiful cake, but probably not for their dessert case items."}
{"text":"This place is so impressive.  All of the desserts look like a work of art, and they taste fantastic.  Lots of interesting flavor combinations with the cupcakes and macarons.  The coffee is REALLY good, and the service is great, too.  I recommend them for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My new go to for any cupcake/cake order. 

Asked for a very specifically decorated cake and cupcakes for my son's 24th birthday. Not only did they hit it out of the park with the decorations but the flavors were out of this world. Banana Peanut butter and Butterfinger. 

Will go back as often as I can make a reason to."}
{"text":"Gimme some sugar, gimme some artificial tasting frosting and then gimme my tooth brush. 

Sorry to be the buzz kill of the group, but I'm not loving what I had here. We ordered 3 different macarons, Nutella, Maple-Bacon and Late Night Snack. The first bite of each, all I could think of was how artificial it tasted. It tasted like someone had stuffed store bought cake frosting in between the macarons. I took a bite of each and couldn't finish any of them. 

The rest of their dessert cake wasn't that appealing. They had inidividual size treats, like dirt cake and the such, but each costing around $6? Gimme (no pun intended) a break. Way overpriced on all of their desserts here. Would much rather spend my money and calories elsewhere."}
{"text":"Super cute, super girly, I like it. 

I have to say I'm a dessert person, so I was really excited to try this spot. The ladies working here are so nice. They offer suggestions and don't mind our sometimes loud girl chatter. They serve alcohol as well, which is also a plus! 4 stars for the amazing customer service and their wine. 

However, I'm not too fond of their desserts. While the macarons are huge and come in a variety of flavors, it's just way too sweet for me. And the texture is a little off from what I'm used to. I also tried their strawberry & champagne cupcake, which was just eh. The cake was dry, way too much frosting and the strawberry filling was way sweet. I really wanted some water and to brush my teeth after. Their chocolate chip cookie was average and way too oily. The oil had soaked through the paper bag and onto the napkin I placed it on. Needless to say, I've had better baked goods before. 

All in all, I do enjoy this place with my friends when we need some girl time and maybe something sweet. But I wouldn't come here on my own."}
{"text":"Right when I walked in I was amazed at how gorgeous everything looked! Very chic furniture. And they also had gorgeous display cakes along their wall. The worker there told me and my friend that everything the sell there was made right at their store, pretty neat! There was a lot of different kinds of desserts you could choose from cakes to vegan cookies to macarons. And they have GIANT macarons, kinda pricey at $3.50-$4.50 per macaron might I add. My friend just got the Nutella macaron and it was nothing special, not the best macaron I have had but it was still delicious. I got the fig and goat cheese macaron just because it sounded odd to me and I love to try new things. That day I learned I do not like fig... Or goat cheese. The workers were extremely nice and welcoming. Also on Mondays they are only open by appointment only?"}
{"text":"If you are a macaroon lover this is the place to be.  I just realized im not really into macaroons but this bakery offers the best I've ever tasted. They are a bit oversized so get ready to indulge in a rich, sweet pastry. I ordered the nutella macaroon, snickerdoodle, thin mint and birthday cake.. the nutella macaroon was very sweet and rich.. nonetheless it was still good. The ambience of this place was gorgeous very girly and sophisticated. Theyre open til midnight so if you wanna lounge with your gals you can do so !"}
{"text":"The two stars are honestly because of how good it was last time I was here. However, on Yelp as well as on the door there are hours of operation which say Monday through Thursday 10am to 8pm, Friday and Saturday 10am to 10pm, and closed on Sunday. 

Here I am, parked outside on a Wednesday at 6:50pm. The lights are on, there are desserts in the case that I can see, however the OPEN sign is no longer lit and the door is locked. Honestly, I wouldn't mind it if there was a sign on the door explaining why they are closed for the night, but there is none to be seen. So, if there is clearly hours on the door, I'd advise them to stick to it. 

I guess the next time I decide to come here, I'll call to actually make sure they're open. I would advise those who would like to try their desserts to try, too!"}
{"text":"Once again... Simple, Beautiful and Delicious! My wife loved her birthday cake. I wish you could see the sparkles on the cake but unfortunately the Camera could not capture it."}
{"text":"I had a late night craving and my roomie told me about this amazing place that's not to far from our house. Once she mentioned that they had Samoa macaroon's I was SOLD! Upon arrival to the store they have two sides; a merchandise side to swag yourself out in Gimme Some Sugar gear and the bakery side. I arrived 20 minutes till closing and asked the nice lady about the Samoa macaroon's and she told me they were sold out since that morning. I was totally bummed out but then she mentioned a Nutella Macaroon which she gave to me for free. WOW!! That macaroon was amazing! I ended up ordering 5 more to help me satisfy my sugar cravings. All in all I'm a fan and will be back to try their infamous Samoa Macaroon.."}
{"text":"This place is so beautiful!  Very chic.  The display cakes are jaw-dropping.  They do cakes for celebrities, so you will not be disappointed in the cake design!

I love the cheesecake and macarons.  They're giant!  My personal favorite was probably the mint chocolate one, the one where they put an entire Girl Scout cookie inside.

They're open very late, so you'll love it if you get a late night sweet craving.  And they serve wine!  Great for a ladies' night out, or date night!

Brenda is super sweet and helpful!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have lived a mile away from Gimme Some Sugar for over three years and never stopped by for a treat. Shame, shame, shame on me.

When I did some research on the \"Bake Shoppe\" in the shopping center near the 215, I found out it was a well known bakery, so I immediately went to their website and researched whether or not they had gluten free options. On their site they said they had gluten free options, and I saw a couple reviews on Yelp only mentioning their gluten free brownies. However, when I went onto their Facebook page and asked about gluten free options, they immediately replied and told me most of their Macarons are safe for me to eat. I almost immediately jumped into the car and headed over to their shoppe. 

When we got there, we tried their gluten free brownie with nuts and onr Macarons: PB&J. I was worried that the Macaron was going to be too sweet and put me into sugar shock. Not even. Perfectly balanced. Sometimes gluten free baked goods can be dry, overly sweet, grainy and disappointing. When I eat a baked good that tastes like peanut butter and jelly and brings me comfort like only that kind of sandwich I can, I knew everything else was going to be great. Even though the brownie was dense, it was like a delicious flourless chocolate cake with a rich ganache. I coudn't eat it all at once, but that's what made it so delicious. The brownie (since it was huge) lasted me three days which is the way to eat baked goods!

Also, I found out that you can have parties there with friends, wine and pre-ordered Macarons. The shoppe is swanky and classy with just a bit of an edge, and after telling my friends about how delicious everything was we will be planning a fun ladies night there too. 

Stop on by, try the Macarons; they're light, delicious, not painfully sweet and always hit the spot, and I can't wait to stop by there again soon!"}
{"text":"Had a Living Social coupon for a dozen cupcakes - got them for wife's birthday.  A small hitch in service was more than made up with great cupcakes and having them delivered.  Had the red velvet cupcakes and were treated to pumpkin spice ones.  Looking forward to trying their cakes."}
{"text":"Call before going... Online it said they were closing at 10 but when I showed up at 6 on a Saturday they were about to lock down the store. The interior is really cute but I think their \"cuteness\" is trying to compensate for the quality. There wasn't a lot of variety to choose from and I was super bummed out about it. I ordered a single macaroon (because it was all that looked good) which was huge and proved that bigger isn't always better. I would have rather had a smaller cookie with bigger flavor and softer texture but instead got the opposite. The lady behind the counter who seemed pretty nice gave me a free doughnut for being the last customer since they were shutting the doors. It was a typical chocolate creme filled but it looked melted and was messy. I took one bite and it was nothing special. Tasted like a doughnut someone forgot on their dashboard in their car for a few days. Tossed it. I feel like this place has a lot of potential but whoever running it needs to understand looks aren't everything and there's a looot that they need to work on. I wish I had trusted the other reviews. Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"their product  looks great, but has no flavor!!..way to pricey for what you get...both girls are hard to deal with and have the personality of a tumbleweed!...pass this one up!"}
{"text":"I think it's new owners. Not the same....
I asked the woman behind the counter if they were new owners and received a hesitant reply of \"same chef\" and no confirmation of ownership change. 

All the sample cakes that adorned the store's wall pedestals were gone as well as the framed articles on the wall of the celeb cakes featured in many magazines. 

Macarons did not taste the same, less variety and now selling all sorts of Majestic Bread products

Wouldn't be surprised if name change was forthcoming"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and this place is just sooo cute! It's located off 215/Stephanie in the shopping center that Gold's Gym is in. 
I love that they're open really late, as that's when I get most of my sugar attacks lol. If you look around, you'll see that they have some AMAZING cake designs. They also have a good amount of drink options, coffees and wines yumm.I'll keep updating this everytime I try something new.

Tropical tease cake: sweet and tangy and light. LOVED this one. You'll like it if you like mango and passonfruit. Kind of reminds me of the flavor of the mango key lime cheesecake at cheesecake factory but much lighter  $7

Chocolate Chambord: rich and creamy and has a strong taste of chambord. I'd like if I tasted a little more raspberry but it was definitely delicious. I think it was a little cake layer at the bottom and covered with mousse $7

Chocolate chip cookie: reaaaally chocolatey and rich however the one I got was pretty raw on the inside. My mom has brought some to me before that had an amazing chewyness but not raw so I think I got a bad one today. Definitely not a cakey cookie. 

Macarons: first of all, these are seriously the size of your palm. Not your typically macaron! 
twix- chocolate and caramel, whats not to love?
I forgot the name  of the second one I tried but it had coconut and chocolate. Extremely delicious but a little heavy so this is not for you if you want a light dessert $4.50

The girl that helped me today was reallly sweet and had a great bubbly personality. And my total for today was $26. A little pricey but for the quality of the desserts, it's definitely worth it! Will be back soon! Next on the list: cheesecake, tiramisu, fresh fruit pavlova, fig & goat cheese macaron :)"}
{"text":"The girl who worked there last night was super nice in the beginning and eager to talk to us. 

We ordered 2 bake goods, around $10-11 dollars TO GO and did not stay or sit there. Once we paid, with a credit card, WITHOUT giving her a tip, her attitude changed. She immediately turned rude and less friendly after paying because we did not give her a tip. It was so obvious. 

I hope the manager talks to their employees about this. Or they will slowly lose their business. That would be sad, especially when there's a bunch of other nice bakery place around Vegas.  Or, at least train your employee to be a little less rude (or less obvious) when not receiving a tip from a customer."}
{"text":"What an adorable place. I love how it is decorated. Very classy, clean, roomy and spacious. The staff is helpful when you have questions about the products. My 2 friends and I decided to each buy the item that caught our eye and then SHARE. Thank goodness we did. WOW-- sweet is the only way to describe the items we tasted. Almost too much for my taste buds. We ended up getting boxes to take our treats home. I don't think I would be a regular customer, but for a treat or a get together with some friends- this a good place to go."}
{"text":"Me and my friend  went on a Thursday night to celebrate her Birthday, she had a dentist appointment that morning so she had to be careful what she ate.We told the lady in charge and she was so helpful and friendly.We got the Brownie chocolate mousse to share and it was delicious, soft and smooth not to sweet. We both loved it.To drink i got a glass of wine and my friend got a latte, I have to add that the lady gave me a sample before i made my choice about  wine, and i only did one because she recommended a really good one.
We both loved the decoration and music. Perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine, good dessert and good friends. 
Thank you Gimme some sugar :)"}
{"text":"This review is primarily from my experience from having them cater a family members birthday party.

We had ordered a few different short cheesecake bites with a variety of other cupcakes. All of them turned out amazing and the display was perfect. We had them customize a birthday cake thing for my grandpa in law who was celebrating his 100th birthday. They wrote on it exactly what we wanted & he loved it.

From what everyone had said was that the desserts were very rich. SO, if you like really rich desserts you will probably love this place. I really want to try the macaroons and I'm curious if they have gluten free options!"}
{"text":"As far as bakeries go, I was very happy. They had a great selection. I had the choc covered strawberry macaroon, which was recommended by the staff. It was not overly sweet and a very large portion. Coffee was ok, but nothing to write home about. The thing that impressed me the most was the atmosphere. I went for a girls night and we were so comfortable, we sat there for three hours just talking and enjoying our pastries. Nice to have a place open late that's not a bar."}
{"text":"Excellent communication from the start. Wonderful gourmet choices for our custom wedding cake...we ended up choosing the chocolate peanut butter cake in a 8\"x6\" round formation with buttercream icing, fondant, and swiss dots. The cake was very delicious and we had plenty left over for guests to leave with...the 8x6\" size was so tall that the pieces were very large and easily fed 25 guests plus 10 take away pieces for later. The cake arrived at our chosen restaurant on time and we were correctly invoiced. Thank you for making our wedding meal complete with a wonderful cake...I needed something beautiful, reasonably priced, and delivered ontime."}
{"text":"Before placing my order, I was offered 2 samples (banana cheesecake and a blackberry macaron). The macaron texture was appetizing, but the mix of blackberry jam and buttercream filling made the macaron too sweet. I prefer having one filling (ganache, jam, or buttercream). The banana cheesecake was unique and tastey, but I didn't care for the texture of the graham cracker crust. It was chewy instead of crumbly like a proper cheesecake. The items I purchased were a snicker-doodle and chocolate chip cookie, salted caramel cupcake, and a chocolate ganache brownie. The best item by far was the snicker-doodle cookie. It was the only item that wasn't too sweet even with it having cinnamon sugar. The ganache brownie compared more to a chocolate cake and that is what it should have been labeled. It was overly sweet and was nothing like a brownie. The salted caramel cupcake was inedible except for the frosting which earned the star. They should change their name to Too Sweet To Eat."}
{"text":"I love how cute and funky this little bakery is.  I got a chocolate chip and snickerdoodle cookie and a snickerdoodle macaroon.  I loved how chewy the cookies were.  The macaroon was good but really sweet and I could only have half of it. The cashier was wonderful,  very upbeat and answered all my questions. I will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"I had a serious craving with a friend for some sweet decadence after a long day. After seeing all the reviews I figured this was a shoe-in.

I was so so disappointed. The confetti cupcake was so dry and mealy, while also being dense, the tropical tart's top had become thick and gummy in the time sitting in the fridge display with the layers falling apart, and the pistachio macaroon was overly sweet and sticky, and not as fluffy with the melt-in-your-mouthness. The rich, nutty pistachio flavor was lost.

I was so sad that these didn't taste as good as they looked! It should be noted that I went in around 5:45pm today, so maybe they had been sitting out for a while."}
{"text":"Gimme Some Sugar is my baker of choice when it comes to cakes or desserts!  They have provided cupcakes and cakes for me in the past not to mention that I have been to several events that they're baked goods have been served at and each time is as great as the last.  Their cakes look like mini sculptures - pure works of art!  And the icing on the cake (HA!) both Miranda and Kristen are great to work with!  It's always a treat to work with GSS!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. We have been in several times and the service is always stellar... So far all the goodies we have tried have been delicious as well. A hidden gem for sure!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about my experience with this bakery!  Ashley was awesome and not the least bit bothered by my excessive emails and questions . . . and the cake design execution was beyond everything I could have hoped for.  Yes, the cake itself was very sweet, but that is to be expected.  The overall transaction was worth every penny and then some (I was expecting the cost to be so much more!)."}
{"text":"I called this place to place a cake order. First of all, the person who answered the phone answered, \"Hello?\" I had to ask if I was calling a bakery. It was so loud, I could barely hear him. After confirming I was calling the right place, I told him I needed to place an order for a cake. He put me on hold. A couple minutes later, he was back on the phone and asked \"Sorry, what did you need again?\" I again said I needed to place an order. He responded, \"Okay, I'll have her call you back.\" I asked if he needed my number. He confirmed that he did, and then put me on hold AGAIN. Mind you, the entire time I still can barely hear him, because it is SO loud. I hold for about a minute. I come back on and, after obtaining my number, he says \"Okay so you want to pick up your cake early?\" For the third time I told him I needed to order a cake. He told me Scarlet would call me back. As soon as I hung up, I called another place and put my $350 order with them. Scarlet never called me back."}
{"text":"Amazing! Fantastic best cupcakes and macarons!! I've tried pastries all over Vegas, and by far these are the best!"}
{"text":"They have a variety of giant french macaroons! All look so yummy to look at. I ordered some for my nieces and they loved it! We also had some of the pastries. Hmm I'm not really a fan of it. I feel like it was missing something, just not sure what. Their prices are the same as going to the pastry stores in the casino at the strip."}
{"text":"They were awesome people working here if they were mean to some one i saw the other person being full of them selves and horrid. I have seen a few but they seem to love me very good products and service"}
{"text":"I am pained to write this but feel compelled. First off this place has amazing cookies and macarons.

I don't know if it is new owners or what but the customer service has gotten very bad.

A few months back i showed up more than a half hour before they were supposed to be closed and all the lights were off and I could see 2 ladies inside closing up shop early. Very disappointing to say the least.

The next day I emailed the \"owner's\" email I was given by an employee, and never heard back from them.

Needless to say I won't be giving them my business anymore"}
{"text":"The interior of this place is really cute.  It's the kind of place where you want to bring your peppy girlfriends and pooch puppies.  I've been here a few times and each time, I've only had a mediocre time.  I've tried the macarons and the latte.

Macarons: They are completely super sized.  They're the side of the palm of my hand and about the size of a slider.  I think macarons are much more enjoyable when they are their normal size rather than jumbo size.  With these jumbo things, it's just too much - too much flavor and too much sweetness.  I could only eat half each time.
         
     Vanilla Macaron - Too big and too sweet
     
     Manly Macaron - They looked to delicious.  It includes caramel and bacon bits. Too much flavor in my mouth and too sweet. 

Latte - Good, but not spectacular.  

Overall this shoppe has very nice interiors, their goodies look aesthetically pleasing, but not a place I would go to on the regular."}
{"text":"More like \"Gimme some better customer service.\" I feel partially to blame for referring my friend to this bakery for her baby shower cake.

Gimme Some Sugar has catered several events that I attended, and I was always impressed with their creations. My friend had numerous issues with customer service, which is attributed to the bakery shutting down completely for Life is Beautiful. Despite red flags (ex: not returning e-mails promptly), the bakery promised and confirmed to have my friend's baby shower cake completed by the coming Sunday at 1:00 p.m.

We drove 25 minutes to Henderson to pick up the cake. Once we arrived, we noticed the parking lot was desolate. The bakery was closed. We rang the doorbell multiple times and knocked on the doors, and even looked through the windows. No one was there. My friend and I both called, texted and e-mailed the bakery. No response. 

We left the shop but ended up making a u-turn to give it one last shot. When we returned, an SUV was parked in front of the bakery. We rang the doorbell and one of the owners answered. My friend told her we arrived on time but no one responded. The owner said their shop's door was open and that there was someone onsite. Total BS.

The cake, which cost about 100 bucks, looked like it came from a UPS facility. Not much thought and care was put into the packaging. It was placed in a brown, unsealed cardboard box as opposed to a regular cake box. Overall, its appearance and flavor were disappointing. Oh and supposedly, from what we were told, it could feed 20 people, IF it was cut into small pieces. WTF?

I would never again recommend to anyone to have their cake made here for their special occasion."}
{"text":"Had an appointment for a cake tasting today and my experience was wonderful. I can't wait to see how my birthday cake turns out."}
{"text":"We ordered a cake from them in the past and Gimme Some Sugar did not disappoint! It was beautiful and delivered by one of the owners herself! We make sure to order every specialty cake from them. 

So when I heard Gimme Some Sugar was opening a bakery I was super excited!! We've ordered cake pops and cup cakes at least 6 times and our guest are always so impressed with not only the presentation but the absolute deliciousness!!! Prices are competitive to other high end bakeries. 

Love, love, love!!! I've never been disappointed... Gimme Some Sugar has a customer for life!"}
{"text":"We got cupcakes for our party and they made them look awesome.  Not only did they look great but ours tasted fantastic too.  We will make sure to go back for all our pastry needs.  Much better than other cupcake places we've tried."}
{"text":"Ugh, another disappointment. I guess I should stop trying macarons here. It was not good. I asked the girl at the counter which flavor was best and she recommended the fig and goat.....sounds delicious. She asked if I preferred cold or room temp, as they offer both. I went with room temp since it had cheese. Ugh....I mean, UUUGGGHHH. It was not good. It completely crumbled apart when I took a bite. That's not what's supposed to happen. I put it away and brought it home to put in fridge, thinking maybe that will help.
It didn't. It was better, yes, but not a delicious macaron that I was expecting.
In Paris, they are so good. I was told that they are that way because they keep the eggs and butter at room temp for 3 days before making. Maybe that's the secret. I don't know. I know I've been chasing them since I had one in Paris, and none have ever compared. Sadly, TJ frozen ones were pretty good. I mean, come on! There's gotta be a place that can make an amazing macaron. Oh well, the quest continues.
Service was GREAT. Other stuff look good too. Prices were OK. They serve beer and wine and have late hours. At this point, since its so far from me, I doubt I'd return."}
{"text":"Very cool place with incredible desserts! The brownie a la mode is out if this world and the berry cheesecake crust is made out of a cookie. Yuuuuuum!!!!"}
{"text":"My Mom used Gimme Some Sugar for her Vegas wedding in October. She sent me in the tasting since I am local and she is not. The cake was so good! Moist and flavorful. She got Chocolate cake with chocolate mous filling and lemon cake with lemon curd and butter cream. The lemon curd is amazing on its own! Even though her order was just a small one, the staff was so helpful and friendly at the tasting, via phone and email and on the day of pick up. I will definitely use them in the future!"}
{"text":"We used GSS for our wedding.  Their s'mores cake is amazing!  They nailed the design we were looking for--the cake was so beautiful!  I received numerous compliments on the cupcakes as well--everyone said they were delicious.  The only reason they didn't get a 5-star rating is because the cake was difficult to cut through during the cake cutting ceremony.  But flavor-wise everything was on point!!!"}
{"text":"It was my Birthday so I said I'm definitely having some sweets today. I saw this place on some of my Instagram friends page and it looked so good. We got there later in the evening and it was a ghost town. We were greeted by the woman behind the counter who helped describe all of the goodies behind the glass. It was a tough decision  so we went with 6 macaroons(you get .50 off if you buy 6). The woman also gave us an extra since there was a broken one in the case. I also had a cupcake, it tasted like banana bread with frosting and candied bacon on top. It was delightful! So many more things to try so I will be back."}
{"text":"French macaroons were wayyyy too sweet, and the cheesecake wasn't anything special. Texture on my macaroons were so so, that being said, they get an A for presentation. The most deceptive thing about baking is just that...looks can be deceiving.

For the same prices you can have quality at Carlos bakery in the Venetian now, for my Henderson residents!"}
{"text":"This review is both for their custom cakes and the delicious treats at the bake shoppe. 

Ordering our cake was a breeze, we gave them a concept for our wedding cake and they ran with it. I can't wait to see how it will turn out. The tasting was a very fun and personable experience. Yes you do pay for your samples however I believe it is  deducted from the total cost of your cake. We went with 3 flavors Red velvet with cream cheese icing, chocolate cake with cookies and cream icing, and banana cake with salted caramel icing. 

The Bake Shoppe, seriously how have we gone so long without a place like this in town. Sweet treats until midnight in a romantic/fun atmosphere and they serve wine, champagne not to forget their coffee/hot chocolate products. I believe it's Lavazza but I could be mistaken. Everything I have tried has been amazing! The chocolate mousse dome and birthday cake macaroon are my favorites at the moment. Paired with a glass of The Pessimist, seriously it's amazingggg.

The Girls at GSS know what they're doing, I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"Had them do little truffle boxes as parting gift favors for an event we hosted for a client and they were great!  The box was darling, the truffles were amazing and the staff was on it.  They made everything easy for us and our guests were impressed!"}
{"text":"Was looking for these cute iced cookies for my engagement party and came across this bakery! I am beyond happy! Came out way ABOVE my expectations!! I even tried one before wrapping them up and the cookies taste like heaven!  (P.S- they offer to wrap them for you for an extra charge...it's cheaper if you just go to Michael's and do it yourself)"}
{"text":"This is the best sweet place ever !!! They've done my wedding cake and I was just in town and had to have a salted Carmel cupcake and it was DELISH !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very pretty stuff they have here! Definitely pricey, and some of the items are very good, and some are mediocre. 

Came here to get some sweets for a business meeting. Ordered a couple of macaroons: giant in size and range from$3.50 to $4.50 each depending on the flavor. They were flaky and good but definitely alot more sweeter and larger than the authentic french versions. Be prepared for ALOT of sugar. We also got several of the pastry items: PB&J cheesecake, dark chocolate tart, ranging from $5-$8 each, definitely very expensive compared to the other bakeries. We did love the chocolate tart, and the cheesecake but the lemon tart was not very good. 

The presentation is very beautiful, and service was nice and attentive. The prices are really just high for what you get, and so I probably would not go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"The custom cake you made for my Mom's birthday was amazing!!! Not only did it look amazing but it tasted even better. It was truly the hit of the party."}
{"text":"Aside from picking up my online order, I haven't spent time here - so this might be a little biased. 

The inside is gorgeous! Bright, bold and absolutely adorable. They offer a wide variety of cupcakes in multiple sizes, and macaroons that are gi-freaking-gantic. They're HUGE! 

The girl at the counter was really nice, and was just finishing up frosting my order when I arrived. Someone else had placed the order, so I didn't know exactly what I was picking up, but assumed by the $72 pricetag that it was 4 dozen BOMBASS cupcakes. 

...I was close. There was 4 dozen BOMBASS MINI-cupcakes. yes. 48 bites for $72. Yikes. 

The flavors were fantastic. When you order, you can mix and match any of their cake flavors with frosting flavors. This allowed us to enjoy things like chocolate cupcakes with coffee buttercreme and espresso sprinkles, strawberry cupcake with nutella frosting and funfetti cakes with blue-tinted vanilla cream cheese frosting. Yummers. 

If I lived or worked anywhere even relatively close to this location, I'd probably try it again on a smaller scale; however, I live in N. Vegas and work downtown, so that most likely won't happen."}
{"text":"Even though I wasn't able to have  Gimme Some Sugar make my wedding cake I knew that I wanted to stop by their new bake shoppe while I was in Vegas. My husband and I were not disappointed. The opera cake is a must! I even picked up a few gifts for family while I was there and was told that the birthday cake macaroon was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I have come to this bakery for two custom cakes and have been blown away both times! I sent them a picture of a cake I needed for my best friends baby shower and they replicated it perfectly if not better! The staff here always gets back to my emails promptly and makes it super easy to order!.....maybe a little too easy? :)

An extra special mention to Ashley who is always super helpful. The staff will make great recommendations if you are stuck and need an expert opinion."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, amazing!!! Gimmie some sugar made our wedding cake and it was out of this world!!!! You have got to try, this place is outstanding!! Thank you all!!!!"}
{"text":"Great selection of sweet tooth satisfaction! The staff was knowledgable and very helpful. Nice looking decor! Tried the giant biscuit sized macaroons and a chocolate turtle. So good! A bit out of the way for me, but worth the trip."}
{"text":"My husband ordered a cake from here for a special occasion and it was the smallest one they had ($60) since it was just for us two.  The cake was very pretty however the cake itself was very dry and tasteless, and burned on the bottom. Also the buttercream icing was also tasteless.  When I spoke with the bakery about returning the cake for a refund they refused, only offering to remake the cake since they had already put in the labor for making the original cake.  This was strange to me because making another cake would be the same amount of time and labor as the first one.  This was also frustrating because the occasion it was needed for had past, and we really didn't want to try anything else from them.  Per their request I also brought the cake in also to verify it was burned on the bottom and that we had only touched one slice of it.  We agreed to have them make a replacement cake however changed the cake flavor and icing (thinking maybe another type would be better). Unfortunately the cake was just as disappointing.  Although the bottom was not burned this time, the cake was again extremely dry and flakey, and overall it was not sweet or enjoyable.  We order cakes all the time from high end bakeries and have no issue spending a lot on good quality desserts.  Unfortunately this place is not up to par.  Although they did attempt to remedy the issue by making another cake, offering a refund would have been better in terms of customer service.  If you want something that is worth the price and delicious, go to Freed's."}
{"text":"I didn't even get to try their baking. The service was so poor and they were so rude it ws if my order had no meaning to them, which clearly it didn't. It was easy enough to find another bakery that wanted t o take the few minutes to talk to me about what I wanted. Since this business was referred to me, I'll be certain to pass on how I was treated. If you want to spend thousands on a wedding cake and require rudeness in your service, these bakers are the ones for you."}
{"text":"Sealing the deal!

I saw the sign facing the 215 for weeks.  Drove by one day only to find out it wasn't open for business yet.  As the weeks went by, I stared longing at that sign EVERY damned day, wondering when the hell I was going to get my chance.

Then, by chance, my wife decided she would get me some sugar and they were open!  She came home with a really nice bag that contained these attractive pink boxes with clear cellophane lids (presumably to see the contents, eh?).  Unfortunately for my review, she's not very detail oriented, so I can't really tell you the exact names of what she bought, nor can I even describe the store and what other goods they offer.   Here's what we ended up with, according to her recollection:

1.  Cake pops: They were chocolate cake with a chocolate shell.  Besides my not understanding the whole cupcake fad (is it really going to last?), I have hated - no really HATED - the whole cake pop thing.  All the ones I've had were either tasteless, dry, way too dense or a combination thereof.  These, however, were the anti-thesis to all that I have hated (HATED) about cake pops.  These were rich, moist and cake-like (as opposed to tasting like they mixed a pound of frosting with some leftover crumbs to hold it all together).  The only thing I hated (HATED) about these particular cake pops is that they were too doggone small.  One bite.  That's all it took.  :(

1.  Red Velvet cupcakes: ok, so it didn't take a genius to know what this one was.  These were tasty, but not as moist or rich as the red velvet I know and love.  Ok substitute, but not enough to make me crave them.

2.  Peanut butter cupcake: I'm not really a fan of peanut butter pastries, so I didn't even take a bite.  She liked them, but she was short on adjectives, so I can't really elaborate.

3.  Bacon Banana cupcake: un-holy-freaking-rock-my-sugar-tooth-believable.  If you know me, you know I'm a bacon addict.  This cupcake was a revelation, a total mouth f***.  But let me back up and start at the beginning.  Once upon a time, there was this little confection that didn't smell all that enticing.  Had it not been for the bacon chunks on the frosting, I would have skipped it.  The scent was a bit confusing, starting with overt rendered bacon fat tones and an undercurrent of burnt sugar.  Not the most appetizing combo in all honestly.  Anyway, after cutting it in two, only then could I smell banana, which really threw my nose for a loop.  Then I took a bite.  I can't say it was heaven, nor that it was the best thing I have eaten in my life.  What I can and will say is that the flavor combination just works.  The sweet of the frosting and salty of the bacon are harmonious, with the tropical banana adding a whole new dimension.  

I love inventive dishes that a cook/chef prepares that tries to let you in on a secret.  Sometimes you're just not meant to understand that secret and other times, when you get it, it totally makes you respect the thought and effort behind the creation.  The bacon banana cupcake really sealed the deal for me.  I'll be back to try some other unique creations.  Whatever they're baking, gimme some sugar baby."}
{"text":"After our Hot N Juicy UYE, most of the group headed here for dessert and was it a trip worth taking.  I had just bookmarked the new business--yesterday was their second day open--when Shirley and Teri decided we'd go here after the UYE if we weren't too full.

We picked out what we wanted and took it to a large dining room type table with some fresh flowers for their grand opening.  I got a macaron that was filled with gif and goat cheese.  What a wonderful combination!  Light crisp outside shell and a smooth interior.  I also got a box of 6 macarons to bring home--maple bacon, s'mores, pumpkin, and Nutella.  I can't remember the other two but they look great and based on the one I ate last night, they will be good!!  The macarons are about 3 inches in diameter--more like the ones at Bouchon than other bakeries that sell them.

While we were having our treats and chatting at the table, the owner came around with a sample of their rich hot chocolate.  It was very good.

For those who have been to a movie or were out shopping, this is a nice place to stop and unwind a bit.  Order some wine and have a sweet.  The interior is very pleasant and the staff is great!  Considering this was their second day open, they did a great job when the seven of us descended on the place.  They're open late on Friday and Saturday.

To the owner--after you've got everything in order there, open another location on the west side of town.  Then I'd see you more often."}
{"text":"I am writing this review since my amazing Girlfriend order my Bday cake from Gimme Some Sugar. I work in the food industry and have experienced some amazing cakes from Micheal Richard in LA, Jean Phillipe and other amazing pastry chefs. I was floored on how amazing my cake turned out; a 3 tiered cake that mimics my life the kitchen. It looked like pots and pans stacked on a butcher block. USUALLY these types of cakes look great BUT taste like cardboard. MY CAKE WAS BY FAR THE TASTIEST CAKE I HAVE EVER ENJOYED HANDS DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!! This cake was chocolate and fresh raspberries soaked in Chambord and finished with a chocolate buttered cream. F&%$!^@ amazing I tell you. The crazy part was that the WHOLE thing was edible, yup even the butcher block it came on.

I called these girls at Gimmie Some Sugar, to thank them for making my bday a true success, the girl who answered the phone was an absolute sweetheart, she kept thanking me, when it most certainly was the other way around! People are still talking about this cake ...and not so much my birthday!

This is not a cupcake store where you buy goods sitting out, this is a true cake studio where creativity and quality of goods come alive and are made to order on a personal level. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Ah gimme some sugar. Their cakes are amazingly beautiful! I followed them on IG and the constant posts finally convinced me to go in.

I was so so disappointed. I'm big on sweets but I didn't enjoy anything here.

I tried a berry Marscapone cake, a cake pop, two macarons, a Oreo and pudding diet cup. Oh and my sister had a cupcake.

The cake pop was the best thing.

The MACARONS had a weird overly sweet whipped cream in them. The cookie part was good but the amount of whipped cream was overwhelming. They are flavored but really don't taste like what they're named because they just taste like whipped cream. Maybe I just got the only two flavors filled with whipped cream. I think it's a cute novelty but it's more like. Crisp whoopie pie or something.

The Oreo cookie, pudding, and whipped cream cup with a worm in it wasn't good.

The cake was the most disappointing. I think it was close to $8 bucks. It was really small, the thin layer of berry \"sauce\" on top was so dry that I couldn't get through it with my fork. It was like super thick fruit leather. 

My sister said her cupcake was good.

Overall it was just disappointed. I had so much expectations since they do cakes for Hakasan and stuff but it was just disappointing. 

The place was very cute and clean but that's all it has going for it in my honest opinion.

The service was eh."}
{"text":"What a fun place!
First off, the ambiance inside is awesome...white \"leather\" highback chairs, black and white, sparkly, modern yet girly...exactly what I think a bakery should look like.
Service is friendly and welcoming and the woman behind the counter really seemed to know about every item they had out. 
The display case is sooo enticing. All the signature desserts on one side and the macarons/cookies/cupcakes on the other. When we were there, they had about 10 different signature desserts out, ~3 cookies, 3 cupcakes, and 8 macarons. I wish I could have tried them all, but we were limited to a sugar cookie, fig & cream cheese macaron, and samoa macaron. Wow so so good. I think my fave was the samoa - caramely and coconut-y and cakey. My daughters (predictably) loved the sugar cookie and (surprisingly) loved the fig macaron, too!
Other reviewers have noted that Gimme Some Sugar's macarons are much larger than traditional - more like the size of a whoopie pie - and this largeness means that the \"cake\" part of the cookie doesn't get fully cooked. It's true; the cake of my samoa was quite goopy. I don't think it's necessarily bad, but it does make these desserts richer than a traditional macaron. I almost didn't finish my samoa because it was sooo sweet and rich (almost). 
The extra thing that GSS has that so many other bakeries are lacking is drinks! They have a selection of coffees, teas, milk, hot chocolate, and even.....wine, beer, and champagne! It really makes you want to sit down and hang out for a while! 
The prices are definitely on the high side....over $2 for a cookie, $4.50 for a macaron, $2 for hot tea. I wouldn't get a bunch to just have at home, but it's a cool place to go hang out and about the same price as coffee and a snack at Starbucks. 
It's not for everyday, but I will definitely be back to GSS and can't wait to try their wine/champagne & dessert pairings!"}
{"text":"I have one hell of a sweet tooth. I love sweets, and I also love to eat with my eyes. Gimme Some Sugar is one of the very best places I have found for desserts that are both beautiful and delicious.

The bakery itself is adorable, with very chic black and white decor. I am not really a fan of the metal chairs they have, they look cool but aren't very comfortable. If possible, sit on the cushy couch in the corner. And it's not JUST a bakery. You can also get wine here!!

The staff has always been extremely helpful when I have gone in. On my last visit I was picking up a box of treats to share with some girlfriends and the lady that helped me had so many great suggestions as to what I should get. I ended up with 3 macarons  and 3 cupcakes, all of which my friends raved about later that evening.

Personally, I have had and really enjoyed the 'haute' chocolate, the salted caramel cupcake and the arnold palmer macaron. I love that the ladies at GSS are always coming up with new and inventive creations for their bakery case. Where else will you find a fig and goat cheese macaron?! 

Two things prevent me from giving GSS a 5 star review:

1. Bigger isn't always better. I would definitely prefer the macarons if they were smaller. I know that there have been times that GSS has offered smaller macarons, and I wish they'd make that a regular occurrence. 

2. They are closed to the public on Mondays."}
{"text":"After 346 Patisserie closed, I wanted to find another go-to Henderson dessert shop. So far, this place isn't it.

Gimme Some Sugar is the \"Bake Shoppe\" located off 215 and Stephanie. They offer refrigerated desserts such as tarts and cheesecakes, baked goods ranging from muffins to macarons, tea, Mothership coffee, and alcoholic beverages. The cushioned chairs, chandelier-like lights, and black rear wall would be nice to enjoy at night, but it's a little odd to step into this kind of place during the day.

They offered me a couple of samples while I was perusing their selections. The chocolate ganache brownie had a rich chocolate flavor and sweetness, and I would have ordered it if I wasn't set on maximizing variety from my visit. The peanut butter blondie wasn't bad, but it was boring and not as rich in peanut butter flavor as I would've liked.

I made several orders. The fig & goat cheese macaron ($5.25) is huge, as all their macarons are. They're roughly double the diameter of a standard macaron and are taller as well. The goat cheese was a delight, and the fig jam and macaron shell provided the sweetness to cement this as a dessert - maybe a bit too much sweetness, but not problematic. My issues were with the macaron shell's texture. It didn't lack crunch, but the exterior fractured into pieces with my first bite, and the interior seemed more mushy than chewy.

Next, I tried the mixed berry scone ($2.45). It is advertised as \"light and flakey\" and \"studded with fresh mixed berries.\" However, it was decidedly neither light nor flaky. Granted, it was soft, but the interior was indistinguishable from an average muffin, and it wasn't that crisp on the exterior. It was, however, too sweet - yes, even for a place called Gimme Some Sugar. Also, there were perhaps a few blueberries in the entirety of the scone. They weren't as prominent as I expected, and there wasn't a trace of the other berries. I'm not too enamored with the sugar crystals generously layered on the top of the scone, but I don't hate them either.

Finally, I tasted two of their cookies ($1.75). The chocolate chip cookie had plenty of chocolate, but the texture is too mushy and there wasn't any rise to it. It is not a cookie that I would recommend. And frankly, neither is the monster cookie. It has a drier feel because of oats and peanut butter, and the generic M&M's (didn't see an imprint) were fine, but I wasn't thrilled.

While Gimme Some Sugar certainly has their fans, some good sweet treats, and friendly customer service (samples and asking a phone caller to hold because I'd waited a while), I wasn't impressed with them overall. Maybe I'll try some of their pricey cold case items in the future (upwards of $7), but otherwise, I'd like Henderson to gimme a new place with better desserts."}
{"text":"Thanks Bethany E. for recommending Gimme Some Sugar. Located in a strip center in Henderson where parking was no issue.

I happened to be in the area so I made it a point to stop in and check out the larger then norm macarons. I purchased two macarons - peanut butter and blueberry. Being a huge peanut butter fan I favored the peanut butter and thought the blueberry was on the overly sweet side. I also returned another day and tried the berry mascarpone but was disappointed the outer layer was on the hard side.

Besides individual desserts I saw some of the custom cakes they make and was blown away by the creativity of the dessert chef here. If you're in the area stop in for a macaron  -  compared to a LV Blvd bakery they are a real bargain."}
{"text":"I was excited to see the banner hanging on the back of their building space facing the freeway. I knew I have heard about Gimme Some Sugar first through Yelp and was happy to see a location on my side of town.
On a Monday morning about 10:00am my sister and I walked in. I was instantly disappointed to see just about nothing for sale. Not a good assortment of baked items at all.
So we were left to choose from chocolate chip cookies, monster cookies (oatmeal, peanut butter & M&M's), candy apples, chocolate marshmallows and Halloween Sugar cookies.
No cake pops and no cupcakes - BOO HOO.......
The lady behind the counter said they will be filling the cases soon but wasn't sure when so we weren't about to camp out until something fresh and exciting was brought out. 
We chose Chocolate chip cookies &  Monster cookies. Both cookies were good - no complaints there - just wish there was more of a selection to choose from. The cookies were put in a cute black N white gift bag and stuffed with yellow tissue paper so the packaging was nice.

I was expecting more of a bakery type of setting but instead it looked more like an office with a small corner for some goodies. So I guess it's more of a cake ordering type of buisness rather than an on site store.

Maybe since they just opened this location not too long ago I should give them some time to settle in and give them a visit in a few months and see if anything has improved....."}
{"text":"The ladies were very prompt to help us out & give us some advice on what might sound good out group. Julie was confident in their macrons & I have to say she was right on the spot! The craft beers & wine list is well put together, hoping this place gets more recognition in the new future."}
{"text":"Came in on Christmas Eve for the very first time. Picked up two really adorable cookies to bring as a gift.

The interior of the shop is really inviting. Feminine and trendy. The pastries and treats all look very professional. What a great little shop. Definitely coming back to try a Macaron. I've never had one, but theirs look wonderful."}
{"text":"FAIL FAIL FAIL.  Lipstick on a pig. Fancy on the outside, products are terrible.

Service, like everyone has mentioned, is to be desired. With an empty place, and three women \"working,\" you would think the service would be better for someone who tells you it's their first time in your business. Not so much. 

There are NO prices on anything and inquiring about the price of items in the case seems to be an annoyance for the women working. $7-8 for a Napoleon is a restaurant price, not a bakery price. I passed on those. 

Cheesecake has a weird, egg-y taste and a drizzle of artificial strawberry glaze. This closely resembles what you buy in a tube at the supermarket. There is also WAY too much butter in the crust and the cake. I was informed that the round cheesecakes were sugar-free (again no sign that indicates that) so I opted for the bar cheesecake and I'm pretty sure it was the sugar free one. I HATE artificial sweeteners and this has that kind of taste. Thank you for giving me the wrong one. 

Maybe this place makes money on their custom cakes, but the grab n go items are definitely not worth paying for, and neither is the treatment you get when you want to buy one. This vaguely reminds me of places in Miami/Ft. Lauderdale that try to pass as fancy bake shoppes because it's the trend, but fail on product and service all the while getting away with exorbitant prices."}
{"text":"I had the ladies at Gimme Some Sugar do my wedding cake. I live in California so we had to do a lot of emailing. The ladies were super nice and worked great with me, they were also very prompt at answering emails. I had a lot of last minute changes and they did and AMAZING job accommodating all those changes. I had 100 people at my wedding all of whom had been to at least 10 wedding in there life time and EVERYONE was so amazed at the look of the cake. They all thought it was just a display and that I would be serving cupcakes or something. None of them thought the cake was eatable. Even my photographer said it was the best looking cake she had ever seen. The colors were wonderful and once we cut the cake and everyone tried it the could not believe it was so amazingly tasty. We had not one peace left. Everyone ate at least 2 peaces!! I must say it made the reception!! Thank you ladies sooo much for making my cake better than I ever could have imagined!!  I cant thank you enough!!

Btw i asked for a supervisor call back and never got one they suck"}
{"text":"I stopped back into this place to give it another try. I was more impressed on my second visit. 

The coffee options alone are enough to draw me in. I enjoyed a Pecan Pie Latte which was delicious. This was the perfect decadent afternoon treat. I also ordered the Monster Cookie which had a nice mix of peanut butter, chocolate, and oats. Lots of flavor and deliciousness. Since I'm very benevolent I ordered the Pumpkin Cheesecake to take home to my husband. This was the main event. The cheesecake flavor was great and then they took it to the next level with a brown sugar based crust. I really enjoyed the cheesecake and was telling coworkers every detail about it the next day.

As I was checking out I noticed that they have packed cookies and chocolate covered pretzels. The chocolate covered pretzels were perfect to pair with a giftcard for a Christmas gift I was delivering the next day. Sweet treats for me and checking gifts off my list."}
{"text":"First of all, the inside is super clean and organized. They have beautiful cakes on the walls where you can see their talent. The ladies working there were also very fun and bubbly and were a pleasure to talk to. I was just there to pick up my birthday cake and WOW was I impressed! It was absolutely gorgeous and EXACTLY what I wanted! I will definitely come back and order more goodies!"}
{"text":"I ordered my daughters wedding cake/cupcakes from GSS in May.  From the tasting to the final product we were very happy.  The tasting was very professional with full size pieces of whatever you wanted to try. We had been at another cake tasting elsewhere that had tiny cubes on a toothpick to taste.  The cake came out exactly as my daughter requested.  After the tasting I never worried again about how it would come out.  The price was extremely reasonable for a wedding cake.  It actually came in $200 under my cake budget! The guests loved the 3 flavors we chose and I personally ate all three to make sure:) The cupcakes were embellished with sea shells and pearls and looked so pretty for a nautical themed wedding out at Lake Las Vegas.  I would recommend Gimme Some Sugar for all of your bakery needs.  I should have written this review sooner but better late than never right?! I've yet to get there for an evening wine and dessert date but I will soon for sure."}
{"text":"I have been looking everywhere for good macrons in Vegas & these are definitely great. Pistachio ones are always my favorite! These are a little too sweet, but they're huge and still good."}
{"text":"I had such a horrible experience here I would never, never recommend this bakery to anyone. It seems as though my unfortunate timing of requesting a gender reveal cake for my baby shower coincided with the bakery attending Life Is Beautiful to hock their confectioneries to concert goers. I emailed and was at first told there would be no issue making my cake, but then after multiple not returned emails and phone calls I started to get weary. However, someone there did get back to me and assured me my cake would be ready for Sunday pick up at 1 pm. Since I was already a week out from my baby shower I figured this was my only choice now since I wanted a custom cake, and most bakeries want at least a two week window to complete such a project.

I sent them my invitation that I had sent out to all my guests. It was a lovely invite done by a friend, it was very cute and professional. I simply asked they recreate the theme of the invitation on the cake, and they could do so however they wanted. The main feature of the invite was a horse wearing a cowboy hat. No such creature even made it on to my cake. I told them I did not want any writing on the cake, and they achieved that much, but the cake was boring and sad, and did not represent my invitation at all.  (See pictures for comparison)

Seems to me like they needed a lot of direction on how to make the cake, which is odd considering they're touted as such a great bakery. You would think they could recreate something given a visual representation. I'm not a baker, nor am I a cake artist, but it can't be that hard. *shrugs*

On top of the fact that my cake was plain Jane and boring as hell, it didn't taste all that great either. The cake inside was crumbly and not moist. The filling inside meant to represent a GIRL was the lightest pink one could imagine -- really, some people at the party were like, uuhhh is it pink or white? when I cut into it to do the \"reveal\" of the gender.

Bad cake, bad customer service, no artistic ability. Also, when I arrived with a friend to the store on Sunday a little before 1 PM, there was no one there. We rang the doorbell, knocked on the doors, and looked inside. I called the bakery only to have it ring and go to voicemail. I also emailed them (which they never returned the email, btw). I was at my wit's end. I had a baby shower to get to (MY OWN!), so my friend and I left, but in a last ditch moment of anxiety I returned to the bakery to see an SUV now parked out front. I went to the door and was able to open it and find someone there to give me my cake. It came to me in a brown UPS looking box, not a nice cake box one would expect when paying over $100 for a cake. I had half a mind to tell them I wasn't going to take it, but I had no time. I paid and left.

This was just a really bad experience and has turned me off of the whole \"custom cake\" game. I can bake my own cakes for my special occasions from here on out."}
{"text":"Their ganache and pavlova is to die for. First went here around Halloween time of last year,  and have been going since! The service is very friendly and they were very helpful when I was making my choices. Their cake presentations on display were beautiful and I'm definitely ordering from them for my birthday this year. I'll make an updated review then, and I'm sure I won't be disappointed! :)"}
{"text":"I love this bake shop! I'm surprised it's not more busy when we have stopped in. Maybe it's the location?? They have happy hour! It's a very fun date night or girls night activity that's a little different. It's usually a dessert and wine combo or some sort. It varies. Great place for a treat!"}

{"text":"I love Gimme Some Sugar. I've had 3 visits till now and I've loved everything I've tried. I wanna start out by saying I live in China town, it's not the closest dessert place for me. Now on to the lovely things I've tried. 
Get Loopy Macaron- this pretty cookie tasted as awesome as it looked. It was a fruit loop topped macaron filled with loopy vodka spiked butter cream. 
Mocha Macaron- my favorite yet. It had a coffee and chocolate filling with a surprise crunch inside. Holy cow it was amazing. 
Chocolate tart- tart crust filled with rich chocolate pot de creme topped with a chocolate ganache and salt flakes. I liked this dessert better at room temp.
Caramel apple- I could live the rest of my life off of the caramel apples. The caramel was amazing and I detected a little salt which I loooooved. 
Tiramisu cup - hubby's favorite dessert. Theirs is very tasty. 
Marscapone cake- this cake was FULL of flavor and texture. 
Strawberry champagne macaron- macaron filled with a champagne butter cream and a strawberry jelly. Sooooooo yummy. 
Reeses chocolate peanut butter macaron- my least fave macaron. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again. 
French press coffee- they use lavaza so you know it's amazing.   

I honestly can't wait to go back now that I'm thinking about all the wonderful things I've tasted. Do yourself a HUGE favor and get over to Gimme Some Sugar!"}
{"text":"My salon is nearby so I walk over to this business...the first time I purchased cookies at 1.50 a pop. They are nice size cookie but the taste is just okay but they are fresh.  The second time I buy the same cookies but now they are not consistent with texture and taste...not worth 1.50 to me...the peanut butter cookies taste like a weak sugar cookie with a little peanut butter...the display cakes look awesome and the lady is very nice."}
{"text":"Well this is too bad. New owners? First off, I walked in and the two women working were both talking loudly on their cell phones. Took a minute for one of them to set their phone down for a second to take my order. My food wasn't as good as it used to be. I used to love this place but after just this one interaction, I really don't think I'll come back - might be dramatic but I just hate employees being on their cell phones when there's a customer (and it doesn't help that the food wasn't great!)"}
{"text":"The only reason why I am giving this store 2 stars because it's very nicely decorated. I came in due to a last minute cake pop run for a 3 year olds birthday party. In desperate need, we tried to get the price lowered just a tad bit like a dollar or two, but no budge. We proceeded to by a dozen expensive cake pops only to be disgustingly disappointed by the taste. The appearance was lovely, but the taste was the opposite. Very bland cake, no flavor! Even the coating was plain tasting. Way too expensive and not good enough."}
{"text":"Went in the other day. Never been there before.
The atmosphere was very nice. I loved that 
Part of the business. I didn't feel they had enough
Options to be considered a bakery. I asked go the strawberry 
Shortcake. I was very surprised the cake was 
$19.00+. I was shocked at the price for such
A small cake, but I bought it and was hoping it would
Be worth it. The cake was very dry but the strawberry
Glaze was good. I was disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Amazeballs! From the ambiance to the service to the baked goods.....so yummy. Try the Strawberry Lemonade Macaroon, won't regret it."}
{"text":"It looks like the Gimme Some Sugar story has come to a sour ending. The story literally ends with a delinquent in paying the rent notice posted on their door. The Gimme Some Sugar story is two chapters. Chapter One is the original owner: Gimme Some Sugar Era and chapter 2 is the Gimme More Sugar: New Owners. This review talks about my many visits to Gimme Some Sugar and the one final visit to Gimme More Sugar. 

Chapter 1: Gimme Some Sugar:

   Gimme Some Sugar was a cute bakery slash sweet tooth hangout all decorated with silver walls and furniture. It was the sweet tooth spot to be at in Henderson from 2013 to the new ownership in 2015. During this chapter, people loved Gimme Some Sugar on Yelp. What a difference from the rock bottom ratings after the new ownership. I was one of the people who loved Gimme Some Sugar on Yelp. I regret that I never reviewed it. At the time I wanted to try a sundry of the macaroons, cookies, and cakes before writing a review. If I did write the Review it would sound like this:

    \"Gimme Some Sugar and Gimme a Toast to tasty coffee with delicious treats. Lately when I am in the vicinity of I-215 at Stephanie Street, I will stop here for coffee and a snack. Everything from the macaroons to the Gimme Some Worms pastry that I treated myself to after hiking on the Paseo Verde Trail is a work of culinary pastry art. On recent visits my friend Shirley. B who is an expert on culinary art had introduced me to their mint macaroon, opera house and Baily Cheesecake. The pastry art is on display as soon as you step inside this sweet oasis in the dry dessert. I had to snap another picture of the display case. Regardless that Gimme Some Sugar is a culinary Wonderland of cakes, I am satisfied with the typical chocolate chip cookie and a cup of coffee. Gimme Some Sugar is more than coffee and dessert. In the evening this makes for a cozy spot to enjoy a glass of wine. By the way, Gimme Some Sugar is also a bakery that creates yummy cakes. Everytime that I have been here the employees have been personable and friendly. Word is that they will be serving Mothership Coffee drinks. I  will be back soon.\" [End of chapter 1]

Chapter 2: Gimme More Sugar

     I would bring the start of the deterioration to late 2015. The reviews would plummet from the topper most to rock bottom. From my experience with Gimme More Sugar, I will say that if I ran the business as it was run the unemployment line would welcome me. The posted business hours seemed to be a suggestion. Just like other reviewers I wasted a trip here during scheduled business hours to be greeted with a locked door. It was a few months ago when Gimme Some Sugar jumped the shark when they failed to accept the Yelp check in offer. I am thinking \"Gimme A Break!\" I show the older lady that I saw for the first time the Yelp check in offer. She flat out tells me that they don't accept it. Bad business! So I just ordered an overpriced late. The woman did bring a mystery treat to my table and asked me how everything is. I was still determined to give Gimme Some Sugar another try. Considering that I am celebrating 25 National Calendar Days this year, I figured that maybe I'd hit them up on National Macaroon Day or National Cheesecake Day. By that time Gimme Some Sugar would be Gave Me Some Sugar. 

The End! It appears that they closed. 

Note: The three stars combines the original owners with the last ones. If it was a review for the original owners: 4 stars and the last ones: 2 stars."}
{"text":"If I can give it a negative I would. Took the time to drive here today to order a birthday cake for our daughters birthday  and we were told that we need to email them ????? Hello????? The fact that we took the time to drive to your place to place an order  would have been a solid sell. But you chose to refer us to send you an email? Bad business.  You just lost a client."}
{"text":"I gave this place a try based on the glowing reviews and was excited to do so. The ambiance is chic and beautiful. The girl behind the counter was helpful and pleasant enough. The prices were a little on the high side but in keeping with a gourmet bakery. We got 4 cupcakes to go and while they were beautiful to look at, we were disappointed to discover they were all dry and hard. While the cake itself tasted a couple of days old the frosting was fresh so I am not sure if they have a stockpile of cupcakes they frost before putting out or if this is their natural consistency. Either way I am not sure if based on this experience I would give them another try."}
{"text":"GSS is fantastic!  Aside from the bake shoppe which is one of my favorite places, they make amazing cakes.  They did our wedding cake and it was out of this world.  It looked amazing and tasted even better.  The customer service here is also great."}
{"text":"I'm so very pleased with how my sons cake turned out for his 1st birthday! It was was beautifully crafted and fun. Although on the pretty expensive side, I'm a firm believer in \"you get what you pay for\" 
I called them and they stayed on the phone with me and made sure that I was satisfied with what I was hearing, it was a pretty great experience. And they have great pastries! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Found this place via word of mouth from a reputable foodie source. Needless to say, this place is AMAZING. They have it all...hand made pastries and cakes, hot beverages, and both wine and beer. Very sexy, chic, and original. Love the concept...it's like a boutique bar and coffee/pastry shop in one. Music bumping. Eye-candy all around. Staff is super friendly, fun and knowledgable. Their cakes are masterfully done and awe-inspiring! Real craftsmanship and dedication that is evident in every bite. The dessert and wine parings are quite impressive. Some recommendations include the French macarons (Mac-a-ron, not mac-a-roon...there's a difference! These things are ginormous and come in dozens of flavors), opera cake (Kahlua and dark chocolate), fruit pavlova (meringue), the vegan cookies (trust me...these are to die for), and the chambord mousse domes (unreal! Chocolate-chambord mousse, something crispy and a chocolate brownie). The best thing is how humble they are. This place (I later found out) caters to A-listers 24/7...like you've likely seen pics of their products in magazines or on TMZ (birthday cakes galore for Hollywood...the Kardashians, Lil Wayne, Paris Hilton, Puff Daddy, Nelly, athletes...etc.), but they are still the most down to earth and professional pastry masters in the game!"}
{"text":"In the midst of studying, I just really wanted something rich and chocolatey. After doing a yelp search for something open late-ish at night, and I came across this place and decided to give it a try. I got the opera cake, which is chocolatey, with coffee and Kahlua - a fabulously rich cake! If it were just a little bit less sweet, it would have been perfect. Their coffee is pretty good too.

The decor is really cute too. There are all these tower cakes on the wall. I'm not sure if they're real or not, but they look delicious.

The person working there was also super friendly, and provided some great recommendations.

It's a little bit pricey in my opinion. A slice of cake was $7. Although, I was eyeballing some macarons (not macaroons) that were a large size for their price - and there were some interesting sounding flavors. At other places I've seen some that are half the size for almost the same price. Maybe I'll try those next time.

It looks like they also have wine and champagne, but as I was going as a study break, I didn't think that would be a good idea.

Hit the spot for my dessert craving. Maybe I'll visit again when I'm in need of something sweet."}
{"text":"I ordered some cookies and cake pops for our wedding and our guests LOVED them, they were delicious and light and a perfect treat for the evening. Can't wait to go back to sample the delights at the shop!"}
{"text":"Cool little bake shop with really good French macaroons. This place serves coffee and wine too."}
{"text":"I was so excited when my hubby surprised me by taking me to Gimmie Some Sugar! I've been hearing nothing but great things from my fellow Yelpers about this place. 

I knew when we walked in I wanted a macaroon, but they have several different flavors priced at $4.50 a piece. Gimmie Some Sugar has a pretty good sized menu. They even have pairings with wine and champagne. My husband ordered two cookies one oatmeal raisin and the other was called the \"Monster\" cookie. It basically was ALL the cookies in one! I finally settled on the strawberry and champagne macaroon and an espresso. The macaroon was super sweet, but balanced with the strong espresso it was perfect. Joel's cookies were moist and sweet as well.  

The decor is very inviting. We stayed and ate at a small table. They also have comfy chairs to lounge in too. It's like a really girlie coffee shop, but with fancy desserts! 

The staff is friendly, but slow. I felt bad for the girl up front cause a line started after we walked in. She had to go in the back and ask the other girl to come up front to ring people up. (I hate to say the second girl was not as friendly as the first. I'm sorry you had your work interrupted, but don't give me a sour puss.)

Overall the desserts are totally worth going for! Maybe with a couple more staff members on the weekend Gimmie Some Sugar could really rock! Can't wait to try all their other tasty treats! It's a great place for a date night or even a treat with your friends."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this bakery, but we normally are not around these parts. We come for a friends housewarming which is very close by so we decided to bring treats for our hosts.

We decided on cupcakes so that we can get a bunch for the guests as well. There were 3 flavors so we got a dozen with several of each - chocolate, a vanilla with sprinkles and a cookies and cream. People seemed to like the cupcakes. I ate a cookies and cream and liked the frosting, but the cupcake could have been more moist for my taste. 

I love french macarons, so I had to try theirs. I liked the fact they had some lovely flavors, but the texture of it and proportions threw it off. It's large whoopie pie sized and so the thickness made the crisp outer layer a bit thick and inside was cakey. I really enjoyed the flavor of the fig and cheese though. Bigger isn't always better as it is the delicate play of textures that I love. It's not bad, it's just not a macaron in the French technique sense of the word. You may love this, but it was not for me.

I think that theres probably some good treats here that are my preference, but so far what I've tried was just decent. I'll probably try some of the cakes in the fridge display next time I'm visiting the same friends in this area."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of a good almond macaron and this place has the best french macaron cookies I have ever had... and they are giant! Like the size of your palm. And they come in tons of crazy creative flavors. Super yum!"}
{"text":"Gimme Some Sugar designed and made my wedding cake and it did not disappoint. I was a destination bride so everything was done via email and I couldn't be happier with the service and the cake. They sketched several designs based on very few ideas that I provided and they got it spot on. When I finally saw the cake I couldn't believe how great it looked and found that it tasted even better. The flavor combinations they offer are spectacular, we went with the chocolate-raspberry and my guests are still talking about it. I would recommend Gimme Some Sugar to anyone looking for a custom cake, they really made my vision a reality and I couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"Gimme Some Sugar is a terrific place to satisfy any sweet tooth cravings!!!
I love that they don't close until 8pm on weekdays and 10pm on weekends.
Their have been countless instances when I feel like something sweet late after dinner and nothing is opened. Thank goodness for these guys!!!

The decor is very pretty and glitzy.    
I've only eaten the desserts, haven't tried the cakes yet but by looks of them they are cake specialists, I'd have to put them in the same league as Shoboy Bake Shop.

The mango cake and the chocolate mousse are my favorites.

I'll definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The whole family ordered something different so it was good to have a bite of everything! We had a snicker doodle cookie, it was a million times better than I have ever made! A dirt cup that was so sweet I was grateful for the size. Birthday cake, mocha and snickers macaroons, I'm not sure what my favorite was. They were all so unique and delicious! A rice crispy treat with a thick layer of Carmel on top drizzled and dipped in chocolate..Amazing! 
I was really impressed with this place and will definitely recommend and return!"}
{"text":"Desperately needing a mental health day, I took some stealthy time off yesterday to get my head on right.  
Nothing does that quite like baked goods, and I was in the area, so I finally stopped in!

The shop was dead...in fact, it took a few minutes of me looking at the menu for someone to even come out from the back.  (Strike one...late greeting...minus half a star)

The prices seem a little high to me...$8 for a cheesecake slice?  I opted for the cheesecake \"bites\" which are little squares of cheesecake.  $2.50/piece.  (Strike 2...the guy initially said $1.50 a piece, and then corrected himself when he actually looked it up to sell. Minus half a star)  I tried the strawberry, and the chocolate swirl. 

The plus sides:  the cheesecakes were really good.  I'm not usually much of a cheesecake girl unless I make it myself...but this was delicious.  Since it was so empty, I had my choice of places to sit, so I pulled up a chair, read my book for the book club, and enjoyed my cheesecake in silence. 

The guy who took care of me did disappear into the back, but he came back frequently to check on me, offering me water, etc.

Verdict:  I like this place, I'll just have to be sure to have a little extra cash next time I stop in so I can try more things."}
{"text":"Came back for more yummy cheese cake. Just needed some strawberry syrup on top. I wonder if they have any."}

Located just off the 215 in Henderson and receiving nearly universal praise from palates I trust \"Gimme Some Sugar\" from Jean Philippe protégé Kristen LoVullo had long been on my 'to visit list,' and thus when nothing in particular struck my fancy for dinner on Saturday I did the only thing a healthy, responsible adult would do - ate dessert for dinner while watching House of Cards and drinking home Siphon Brewed Ethiopian Chelelektu from Heart.  Without a doubt a 'cute' shop with friendly service provided by a young lady named Brenda it was just after 7:00pm when I walked into the small store and with a short line fronted by a woman and her daughter planning a 'Sweet 16' party I spent some time perusing the items and chatting with other customers, seemingly each with a different favorite amongst the store's nearly twenty options.  Featuring plated desserts, custom cakes, jars, cookies, and other take-home treats it was with an eye on variety that I ordered when I approached the front of the line and self-selecting a few favorites along with two selections confirmed by Brenda to be as good as the crowd had suggested I made my way to the door immediately indulging in a buttery cinnamon-laced snickerdoodle with crispy edges and a soft center, the first of a half dozen +1 items tallying $25 after tax and tip.  Showing some restrained and retaining the rest of my purchase for the twenty-seven minute drive home it was with coffee in hand that I continued my tasting first with a bananas-foster-esque cupcake that was plenty moist but somewhat marred by overly sweet frosting but moving on to the dense peanut butter blondie things improved substantially, the dense square loaded with rich chocolate tones and roasted organic peanut butter, a classic combo only improved after a minute on a warm skillet.  Moving finally to what has seemingly become LoVullo's 'signature' item, it was with a quartet of macarons that I rounded out my evening and with each palm-sized cookie featuring a characteristic crackle over rich flavors, the texture of the crmb was actually far more dense than the Parisian classic - a moist cake-like consistency akin to the American whoopie pie and although perhaps not 'traditional,' entirely delicious - both the dense chocolate dipped Snickers and rich, savory Fig and Goat Cheese \"Whooparons\" undoubtedly justifying the nearly hour-long round trip...though if they ever decide to expand I definitely see a market for a second shop in ever trendy Summerlin."}
{"text":"Gimme Some Sugar Bake Shop is the most unique dessert experience in town.  Not only do they have yummy macarons in intoxicating flavors but they serve a variety of delicious selections AND have craft beers, wines and bubbly!  
The wines are very reasonably priced - actually too good.  You need to go before they realize this and start raising the prices. 
This place is a great alternative to girls night out and a perfect place for an after dinner drink and dessert or a date night."}
{"text":"How can somebody who's always had a sweet tooth like me not love this place? I've been telling myself I'll cut back on my sweets intake - it's been a battle that I keep losing. Since this shop is in the same complex as a  Gold's Gym - that's a good enough excuse to indulge in sweet treats, right?

The shop is so cute. Black and white interior and the colors come from the beautiful cakes, pastries and macarons they have. I'm actually wishing my birthday was much sooner so I can get a birthday cake from here. They serve hot chocolate, tea and coffee, milk, juice, soda...and alcohol (at night). Champagne, wine and beer + dessert? Can I just live here? 

Before I continue, I must say that my love for macarons started when I first had them in Paris - oh l'amour! So, I'm not one of those that eat them because they're trendy or whatever. The fad can die but I'd still love macarons. These French cookies are my faves just like chunky chocolate chip cookies. I'd go to a macaron shop at every city I visit for comparison and get macarons in ALL their flavors. So, I'm glad the Vegas area has Gimme Some Sugar. My true test for macarons is pistachio macarons but unfortunately, they didn't have it when I went but I think you can special order items a day before.

They have 10 macaron flavors at a time. I think 2 are seasonal flavors and 8 mainstays. I've tried 10 flavors: fig & goat cheese, Snickerdoodle, strawberries & champagne, Nutella, PB&J, grandpa's blueberry pancake, birthday cake, maple-bacon, Snickers Candy bar and chocolate-covered strawberry. I got 14 macarons - I had to get an extra fig and goat cheese macaron and 2 extra Nutella macarons. I also got a fresh fruit pavlova and a green tea cheesecake. As for the macarons, here's how each ranks:

5/5: fig & goat cheese, Nutella, chocolate-covered strawberry

4/5: Snickerdoodle, PB&J, Snickers candy bar, maple-bacon bar

3/5: strawberries & champagne, grandpa's blueberry pancake, birthday cake

Green Tea Cheesecake:
I love green tea and not a lot of places have green tea cheesecake. The crust is crunchy. The cheesecake is deliciously creamy with a good green tea flavor. It's topped with a thin sesame nougatine and a raspberry. Amazing! 5/5

Fresh Fruit Pavlova:
A pavlova is a meringue topped with fruits. It's light and crisp. It's like a \"healthier\" dessert if you will. 5/5

They warned me that the birthday cake was really sweet and that I shouldn't get it if I was torn between that and another flavor. Hooray for honesty! The fig & goat cheese macaron sounds a bit unusual but it's actually good since I love goat cheese. Sweet fig + tart goat cheese...yum! Nutella is a no-brainer...it's instant love for me. The strawberries & champagne sounded real good and looks so pretty and dainty but the flavors were mild but really sweet. I think the strawberry flavor needs to be more pronounced. I got lucky to have the last maple-bacon macaron. Score! 

The service is amazing here. Very friendly and honest. I was holding up the line with all the desserts I got and I felt bad for the people behind me who came in just to pick up 2 items. But one of the girls who was helping me out offered them a cookie so everything was fine and dandy. Sure, the desserts here cost an average of $7 apiece and the macarons are $3.50-4.50 each - the macarons are HUUUUGE though (the size of your palm or about 4 macarons) and the ingredients are of quality. Hello? I don't mind paying for something good. You can actually get $1 off with a Yelp check-in. And if you buy more than 6 macarons, you get 50cents off each additional you buy.

I was smiling the whole time I was in the shop like a kid in candy store. My friend who was driving me around even said, \"see! It's that smile that makes driving here worth it\"."}
{"text":"Located in the Golds shopping center... this place does alot of the celeb birthday cakes they present to them in the clubs.  Their specialty is custom cakes but they do Ala carte desserts as well.  Open late if you have an after dinner craving.. 

We ordered the pistachio cheesecake and some peanut butter chocolate cake and a chocolate chip cookie.  All of them were rich creamy and luxurious.   the only downfall is the price.  It was pricey to say the least.  I would give it higher stars if it wasn't so expensive."}
{"text":"Wow that was good. Got the tiramisu in a cup and man I kinda wanted to eat the plastic cup too.  It was awesome! My son got a birthday cake macaron and devoured it.  The crime was fresh and delicious.  What's cool is the laid back atmosphere.  Plus you didn't get the whole uppity feel I've gotten from other pastry shops.  You know the I'm a bad ass cuz I can make a cupcake and it's hot on TV right now.  Overall will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Did this place change owners?!? The walls are now bare, the old cakes that adorned the pedestals on the wall are gone, and the good service and welcoming environment that I grew accustomed to have disappeared. It's sad to see how quickly things shift and change hands in this city :(

We arrived on a Saturday night to a completely empty store with no one behind the counter. We waited at least 5 minutes until someone finally walked in the store and greeted us (I presume the new owner) and he walked in the back to get someone to come out and serve us. Very poor \"new\" first impression. 

The pastries do not have the same charm they used to. The cheesecakes were not nearly as mouth wateringly good as they used to be, and the chocolate chip cookie left so much to be desired. There used be little signs up in front of each pastry telling you what it was. Now you have to ask. 

I read on a tip that they no longer accept the check-in offer on Yelp, although I can't personally attest to that since I forgot to check yelp before ordering and paying. 

They now are partnering, I guess, with a bread company. 

This place does not have the draw it used to have and I won't be back soon. Between 346 Patisserie suddenly closing its doors, and this place going so sharply downhill, there isn't a great place to satisfy a sweet tooth anywhere in the immediate area."}
{"text":"Not only do they have really good baked goods, their coffee is solid. I'm enjoying an almond latte. This place has ambience, comfy seating, friendly staff and good wifi. What else could you possibly want from a cafe? Gonna make this a regular place."}
{"text":"I love this bakery! Sometimes we just make an excuse to drive all the way there (25 min from us) I love the Nutella and S'mores macaroons! Chocolate chip cookies are amazing! Naked cakes are delicious. I've ordered customs cakes too and always been happy!"}
{"text":"When you contact a business/bakery via email a week ahead of time letting them know all of the specifics of what you would like for a custom cake that you clearly expect to cost you $200, one would at the very least expect that business/bakery would email or contact you by the next business day if they were just too busy to possibly get to your specialty cake order. Nope, not Gimme Some Sugar! I was contacted FOUR DAYS later in a very poor excuse of an email. After reading reviews of their custom cakes, mostly 1 star reviews, I guess I should be more thankful than irritated at the complete lack of professionalism & customer service!! Take your orders elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Packed up my family to drive here because it said they were open until 10pm on Sat night. We arrived to the shop around 8:30 to find no lights on and a closed store. Was not very happy especially making the trip out there with 2 young children. Also to see that this appears to not have been the first time this has happened to people with some other Yelp reviews. If you aren't going to stay open until 10pm change your hours!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cakelet for a topper and cupcakes for my daughters baby shower. Just let me say it was even better than I anticipated. The cake had a edible doll that looked just like my daughter. People are still talking about it. The taste was amazing. I ordered 5 doz for 40 people and there was nothing left to go. People are calling to find out where my amazing dessert came from. The owner herself came and sat up the display. I could not be happier. Thanks girls!!"}
{"text":"Kristen took my boobilicious cupcake topper order and was very helpful, they customize them down the the skin tone, bra types, monograms, and anything else you can think of.  

In this case I can definitely say you get what you pay for.  They were so cute, held up through 2 airports while I traveled, and tasted great.  Everyone loved them at the party I brought them to and no one had seen anything like them before."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. This is honestly the cutest little place ever!!! I took my husband here for dessert on his birthday and he loved it"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The macaroons are delicious the ambiance is great and the staff is very nice!!! Definitely recommend when you're craving something sweet."}
{"text":"This place just opened. I stopped in to try based on a news story mentioning they had vegan and gluten free options. Today they only had a gluten free brownie but they expect to have more options in the future. 

My wife had a macaron. She loved it. They have a very good selection with some interesting combinations."}
{"text":"Been coming here for awhile now, and I was also here for a soft opening or grand opening?? The inside and cake displays are amazing and very creative. Definitely worth the drive from the west side NV to Henderson. Thy best opera cake!!! This is the place for good sweets. Here they have a whole stand just for macaroons and cupcakes . Assorted flavor and some seasonal macaroons, there is always something new to try."}
{"text":"As much as I wanted to like this place I just couldn't. They serve stale leftover baked goods... First visit I bought a challah bread, I was a little worried because it was so pale but I had been looking for one for a while so I bought it. Although  the dough wasn't undercooked it tasted like it was raw. 

Second visit, I went to buy a cupcake. The display was dismal at best with only the choice of vanilla or chocolate. Not the variety I would expect from a professional bakery. It looked like scraps from the day before. But I wanted to try their cake as I am looking for a baker for my wedding. When I got home ready to try it I couldn't have been more disappointed. The paper was stiff and stuck hard to the cake, then I tried to cut it in half but instead the cake was so stale it wouldn't cut and just bent. 

I also ordered a tea latte, which the girl taking my order didn't even realize was on their menu. As I waited 10 minutes for them to make my drink, they constantly looked back at the menu trying to figure out how to make it. They asked if I wanted it hot or cold. I said cold. But at the end I got what they intended to be a hot drink, but they poured cold milk into it and I got an unpleasant lukewarm tea instead. 

I can't believe I paid money for this. Walmart has better quality goods then this place."}
{"text":"There has been a lot of attention for this new bakery off of Stephanie and the 215 and I'll quickly chime in to add my experience with them.
We visited the weekend they first opened and things were still new, kinks were still being worked out.  However, I did enjoy that first visit with the tasty pumpkin cheesecake.  
A month later, I ordered a custom birthday cake for good friend, Shirley B., who's a big fan of Gimme Some Sugar.  I e-mailed GSS with my requests for a cake with a Hello Kitty and SF 49er theme because those are two of Shirley B.'s favorite things.  Ashley responded promptly and we coordinated on the details.  The resulting birthday cake was just the thing and the surprised look on Shirley's face when we presented the cake at her birthday dinner was priceless; she loved it.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gimme-some-sugar-henderson-3?userid=7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA#xMTMOVBqAc0YKsVJaeUGEA
First-rate customer service from the beginning to the end with Ashley and her shop.  That is a rare thing indeed and I give them five stars all the way for filling the order above and beyond.  I'm a fan and we'll definitely be giving GSS more business in the future."}
{"text":"Tried Gimme Some Sugar cause I am a sucker for sweets and anything retro (the decor, mostly). So I stopped in because I heard through the grapevine that they have macarons and they are HUGE.

The grapevine did not disappoint. The macarons look delicious and are seriously large - bigger than the palm of my hand. I was super excited to grab some, so I ordered the mint Girl Scout cookie, the caramel and coconut Girl Scout cookie, a s'mores, a Nutella, and another one I can't remember. I was stoked!

I brought them home, resisting the urge to devour them in the car. I sat down at my table, opened the box, and was smacked in the face with diabetes. Holy crap were they sweet! Now, I have a serious sweet tooth. I love all things dessert, but these had a sickly-sweet over the top taste that was not very pleasing. I would LOVE a good French macaron, but I can't justify spending nearly $3 a piece for these when you can't even eat a whole one before feeling woozy. (And no, I didn't buy the one with booze in it, either).

Now, I didn't try the cakes or desserts in the case, but I would be willing to. I guess the macarons just weren't for me. I will probably be back for some cake though!"}
{"text":"After our night at Hot and Juicy, we continued on to have dessert at Gimme Some Sugar! They have a new bake shoppe on Stephanie, just off the 215.  In fact, we were there on their 2nd night open!

They have 2 display cases with yummy desserts and the staff was amazingly friendly!  They are passionate about their products and have something for everyone.  

I am not a huge sweets eater, but I decided to have a glass of wine (yes, they serve alcohol!) with a candy cane macaron.  These macarons are HUGE!  Definitely not like anything I've ever seen!  And it was delicious!  

It is great that they are open late on the weekends, this is a great place to come with friends (or on a date), to grab a drink and a cupcake.

I love supporting local businesses and really hope that this place makes it!  My only complaint is that the prices are a little bit high.  It cost me $14 for the macaron and 1 glass of wine....I understand that these are all hand made items, but the cost may deter some people from going back.  $30 for a dozen cupcakes is a little crazy, in my opinion, even if they are really delicious!"}
{"text":"Moved into a new apt down up the street from this place. I have never been here but my 21st birthday cake was from here. It was incredible! So I decided to come to gimme some sugar for a craving. I ordered the apple crisp. I took it to go, heated it up put the vanilla ice cream on top and the pecans. Well the pecans were crushed and candied! How AMAZING, it was to go and tasted so great! It was $10 for my dessert so I won't be able to grab dessert as often as I'd like but it will be a great treat when I do!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to drop in GSS. 
My, oh, my...

I~~ want to swing on your chandelier...

Fancy bake shop! They also serve wine and & beer? Wow...tried their Strawberry Beer...awesome! Pumpkin Cake Pop, bomb! Cheese cakes...(@_@) to die for!!!

The staffs greeted us when we came and was patience when we were browsing around looking for what's good to nom nom on. 

Def be back to try out other flavors of their cheese cake. I'm a huge sucker for cheese cake. 

One day I would to place an order for a custom cake from them. 

Would recommend to Friends and Family."}
{"text":"My go to place especially when I have a major sweet tooth moment. I usually come here on my way to work or after work. I love love their hot chocolate & the Nutella macaroons."}
{"text":"They did an amazing job on a cake I ordered for my husband's birthday last year (I know this review is long over due). I ordered an exact replica of the Kellogg's Frosted Flakes cereal box and came to GSS because they're notorious for their cakes. They do all the big celebrity cakes for nightclub appearances and more. I knew they would do a great job but I was shocked at how close to the actual cereal box the cake looked. Their work is very clean! They even placed the cake on a nicely decorated display board. For the flavor I chose the cookies n' cream and it was better when it was room temperature then straight out of the fridge. I love how the cake was dense but do wish it was more moist and rich."}
{"text":"I have never tried a Macaroon because they are usually with Coconut...which I'm not a fan of. HOWEVER, our first visit here today changed my mind forever!! Peanut Butter Chocolate Macaroon....END if story!! Wow!! Amazing!"}
{"text":"I wish I got the girls name that helped us because she was amazing!!we got 3 macarons strawberry lemonade...gauva..and birthday cake...YUMMM to ALL 3. My youngest couldn't decide and wanted something from the gas station around the corner instead!!! Lmaoo...the girl that worked there gave her a birthday cake macaron to try(wich she didn't like...crazy kid!!)so me and my other daughter split hers lol and took her to gas station and she was happy as all could be getting 2 bags of smarties!!!"}
{"text":"Well, I wish I could rate the desserts here. Unfortunately when we arrived after dinner,  about 7:00 PM they were sold out of almost everything. Just a couple of small $2.50 cupcakes that looked to be out all day and some macarons left. I was craving a red velvet cupcake or chocolate cake but it was not meant to be. The display case was practically empty so we left. Not sure if they just didn't make enough or maybe it was a busy day??"}
{"text":"I have to say that Gimme some sugar is decorated very cute and looks like it could be a great place to hang out.  They do have beers, wine and bubbly to partake in and that is a great highlight.

I'm going to preface this by saying that the ladies who were working the evening that we went were very interested in our opinion on what we thought about the baked goodies.  I had the rice krispy bar and my hubby had the tiramisu.  The rice krispy bar was good but nothing to write home about, the chocolate was a nice touch.  My hubby had the tiramisu.  The bottom half was the best part.  One of the ladies, actually took the parts that were not eaten to show to the chef as where they could improve. 

I'll need to give this place another shot in the future.  They are quite a few more items to try and from what I hear from others they are worth trying!"}
{"text":"In the area and craving a sweet I decided to check my bookmarks and lo and behold Gimme Some Sugar popped up on my Yelp app bookmarks. 

Having heard some good reviews from trusted Yelpers I was excited to give them a try. I walked in and the place is super cute. Clean and well-decorated. I was greeted warmly by the three girls working at the counter. They were ready for any questions and had plenty of suggestions for me while I perished their inventory. I had my heart set on a macaron and they are huge. Interesting flavors as well. I decided on the fig & goat cheese and the maple bacon. I also had some questions on some pricing for specialty cakes and towers and they were very helpful and assisted me with all my questions and gave me lots of information and contact information if I decided to order something for the future. 

The macarons were flaky and moist. I didn't love the flavors, but they were ok. I took a few bites and didn't really feel the need to finish them. I'd be back if I'm in the area to see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"I went in awhile ago to see what this shop had since I LOVE to bake & am always eager to support my local bakeries. I didnt even get a chance to try the goodies because I was so turned off by the staff. The lady behind the counter seemed like she had an attitude, but hey, maybe I came on an off day. Since I have worked my fair share of customer service jobs I know it can be hard to always be cheerful, but I ended up leaving afterwards. I gave them 3 stars because I would like to come back & actually enjoy the goods. They have great reviews and ill update this when I get a chance to try it again. Im hoping I just came on an off day & that the employees aren't actually that rude."}
