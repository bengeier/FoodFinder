{"text":"If you're serious about your coffee Carvalho is the only place you should be going to buy your beans. This local Oakville business roasts Brazilian beans in-house and has an amazing selection of different roasts for sale in half pound bags. They also do larger bags for commercial buyers. The owners, Jamie and Wayne, are true coffee heads and will happily prepare you an espresso or a pour-over so you can taste the magic. I've been a customer since Jan 2015 and pretty much visit once a week to pick up a freshly roasted bag (or two) of espresso beans. Great coffee, great prices. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"my name is rachel and I am a coffee-a-holic. I'm guilty of hipster-diving into an unspeakable number of coffee shops in both Toronto and Brooklyn NYC.

BUT, Carvalho has stolen my heart. The level of flavour dexterity is unmatched - with so many dimensions including a decadent chocolate undertone, I can safely say their beans will be ALL I purchase from here on out. 

Carvalho makes supporting local business a no-brainer. So much gratitude, thank you!!"}
{"text":"This is the best freshly roasted coffee in Oakville, hands down! Give it a try, you will see how different it is. This coffee sold, roasted and grown by the same very nice family from Brazil. 
This is not actually a cafe, but they can brew a cup of excellent coffee for you. This place is mostly for buying coffee beens and brewing equipment. I bought my pour over brewer here. You can also buy their coffee in Whole Food Market."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Oakville for freshly roasted coffee. We get our beans there every Saturday. Medium dark is what we found the best in our opinion, but there are others as well. Very friendly people there, if they are not too busy, they will offer you a cup of coffee :-)."}
{"text":"The best place in the GTA to get quality coffee roasted on site. I've tried many others that had good reviews but always come back to Carvalho. The beans are consistently roasted and extremely well balanced. I rarely have to change the grind with each new batch and my shots are always fantastic. I've even brought the coffee camping with an Aeropress without too much of a flavour sacrifice. 

Jamie knows his coffee and is always willing to spend time to educate his customers if they ask for it. It's not a coffee house in which you sit down with a slice of banana bread and get free wifi for hours so don't expect that if you make the drive to Oakville."}
{"text":"No hours posted, i got here at 11 am on a Monday and they were closed on Mondays. Needless to say this was frustrating. They had 5 stars from 6 reviews so i was hopeful it would be good."}
{"text":"After touring the world and tasting gourmet coffee/espresso, I returned home to Oakville and found that we have an amazing coffee bean roaster right here!! Carvalho Coffee Is freshly roasted weekly, always fresh with a whole range of roasted Brazilian coffee beans!
The service is also excellent, but only open Tuesday, Friday and Saturday!"}
{"text":"Not your average coffee cafe... actually more of a distributer but on certain days of the week you can come in for a cup. As I have mentioned before I am not a coffee connoisseur. All I know is that I had some in costa Rica that I cannot find anywhere else. And I have been searching for that same kind ever since. Just for that nutty, chocolately coffee flavor, without the bitterness, nor the sourness, nor the watered down-ness. Came in to see an office in the front and a small coffee tasting stand and processing machines in the back. Jamie took the time to explain to us the difference in tastes produced by different processes of the coffee bean. You can see his passion and interest in what he does. From where the tastes of acidity/sourness comes from and where the chocolately, nuttyness comes from. He also explained a bit on how it is made and temperatures and timing involved when making a brew itself. So complex, and he did his best to explain and he even let us sample a few. 
I felt bad others came in at different times and some asked the same questions we did so he had to explain it all again. He could hold coffee workshops so we could get all the info at once ha. We sat in this one room for a bit of time but wow, very informative - much better than a wine tasting tour! The coffee was good (as good as my novice taste buds can tell). Who knew I was ordering coffee the wrong way to get the tastes I was searching for?! They do distribute to coffee places in the area, but if you make your own at home too this is a good place to pick up a bag or two."}
