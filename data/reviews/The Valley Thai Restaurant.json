{"text":"The food had no flavor or spice!  We ordered pad thai for lunch and will not go back again.  Service was good however."}
{"text":"Delivery was fast and flavors were well balanced. Got tofu pad see ew, papaya salad and pork panang. Recommend all of them."}
{"text":"Brought my boyfriend for his birthday last night with some of our friends and what a great idea it was. He loves thai food and big critic also. This place blew all of our minds. We had the valley appetizer, shrimp spring rolls, beef jerky and all of it was amazing. For entrees I had the orange chicken and veggie chow mein (so simple I know) with a spice level of 3 and let me tell you I couldn't take it they really don't play with their spice. My boyfriend had a combination fried rice with a sunnyside egg on top he also got pad see ewe and he was more than satisfied. Two of our friends got the massaman again delicious. I asked them if they could make a roti for him it wasn't on the menu but its his favorite they had no problem making it. The fried ice cream was on fire literally when they brought it to the table. How awesome is that?! Everything was great from the service to the food. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We ordered fried mermaid, pad thai and fried ice cream for dessert, it was all good and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this homemade Thai Food restaurant called The Valley Thai Restaurant by accident and I'm so glad I did! 

I had been craving my favorite Thai dish (fried pork belly fat with saut√©ed Chinese broccoli in a garlic soy sauce) for a while when I missed an appointment because I arrived at the wrong address. After having to reschedule my appointment after driving 30 minutes away from home, I turned around to head back home when I saw a tiny flag on the side of the road in the distance that read \"THAI\". 

Needless to say, that flag saved my day.

This family owned business is brand new and very AUTHENTIC. I've eaten at several Thai restaurants all over the world, including Thailand. My best friend is Thai and I love her cooking. I feel my tastebuds have matured to know good Thai food. And The Valley Thai Restaurant serves exactly that. I enjoyed all the fresh herbs and ingredients they use, maintaining a very authentic homemade taste and feel.

I ordered the Tom Kha Gai soup for an appetizer which was delicious. I had the Kana Moo Grob as my entree which was very delicious. I finished every single parcel of food. The lovely and friendly waitress, Belle, told me this was one of their popular dishes. It's located under the Chef Specials on the menu. Their Fried Ice Cream dessert was the icing on the cake. The presentation is everything as it is set afire at the table. 

The prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients and end product. With an appetizer, entree, dessert, tea and lemonade, the bill came to only $32!!  I wouldn't think twice about driving 30 minutes to have dinner here again. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my boyfriend. We were seated fairly quickly and our server was very kind. We got the fried mermaid for an appetizer and it was amazing. As for our meals I asked for Lad Na Spicy 4 ( out of 5)  while my boyfriend got Guay Teow Tom Soup. Most thai restaurants wimp out on the customer when applying spice levels which really irks me. When I received my Lad Na though, boy was it spicy! So be careful for what spice you ask for because they will give you the level you asked. Aside from the spice though the Valley Thai probably has one of the best Lad Na's in Vegas. So if you love Lad Na come here and give it a shot because you won't be disappointed. This is my new go to place for thai food as it is freaking amazing."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! The Crispy duck Tamarind is fantastic! The fire fried ice cream is the BEST!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a few hours to catch my flight back to New York and after a full week of camping was really craving some good food! Yelped and found a bunch of places and decided to take chance on The Valley Thai Restaurant. And boy the reviews are spot on with some really excellent food! The people are so friendly and nice as well! That is why I enjoy family run restaurants and not chain restaurants! The care in making sure the food was perfect was very visible. I had the dumplings, red curry, mint fried rice, tom ka soup and mango with sticky rice. Everything was super delicious and coming from NYC this was absolutely fantastic quality! Can't wait to start and end my next hiking trip with this fantastic gem of a place!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Slight mistake in order:-). I requested   Items specifically with Tofu but due to some confusion there was no tofu in either item (delivery order)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Literally Authentic Thai food. I've tried so many dishes on their menu and they're always really good. You can't go wrong with the Fried Mermaid Tails, Crab Rangoon, Pad See Ew and Red Curry Dish and of course their Thai Tea :)
Service is amazing, they're friendly and patient while you figure out what to order. Love that."}
{"text":"Just checked this place out and wow is all I have to say! The Thai tea is on point, the free appetizers are ridiculous (I had the butternut squash vegetarian option) and the yellow curry and pad Thai totally made to perfection. The cherry on top is the flaming fried ice cream! I'll be back many times I'm sure. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"Taking out food. Don't know yet if their food is good. She is nice and friendly. Getting free ice Thai tea. Thank you"}
{"text":"I totally recommend this place we had fried ice cream,  green tea ice cream and the noodle soup .
Awesome food cheap price great time great service."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing along with the customer service. I come from Fairbanks, Alaska where, oddly enough, we have incredibly authentic and delicious Thai food. I find it difficult to find good Thai in Vegas, but Valley Thai is great and just like home!"}
{"text":"So good! We usually order vegetable Pad Thai, but beef and chicken are good as well! Food is tasty, and service is prompt. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Delicious meal! Fried dumplings, fresh rolls, duck dish, and yellow chicken curry.  Excellent quality."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try the duck. It was definitely not a half a duck as advertised. Very dry. I also ordered a noodle salad, very small again,  charged $11 ! Squid was total rubber! Shrimp was fresh I must say.  The steamed rice was the best of the whole order. May be because I ordered delivery?  Not worth the money"}
{"text":"We went in as a group and ordered food like tapas. We started with the sampler appetizer platter. The shrimp eggrolls/Fried Mermaids were delicious. Everything was great. The curry puffs were amazing and handmade. For entrees, we had the the Crispy Duck Tamarind, Pad Thai, Salmon Curry, and   Andaman Seafood. Everything was delicious and look amazing. The Crispy Duck was my favorite, but Pad Thai was, also, some of the best that I have had."}
{"text":"It was our first visit and will not be our last.  The pad thai was some of the best we have had in Vegas.  The larb was yummy.  We also ordered curry that was also perfect.   The staff was also very polite.  So happy to find this place."}
{"text":"Great food!! The delivery was fast and the delivery lady was very nice! We will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood guys. I was happy to see a \"new\" Thai restaurant nearby. I was suspicious if this was still Sakun Thai with a new sign. We got the pineapple fried rice, red beef curry (ordered chicken), and Tom yum soup with veg. I docked a few stars for following reasons 

Overpriced. I paid $39 for these three dishes. I felt it was about $10-12 over.

No pineapple in my fried rice! I'm talking 2 small half pieces in the entire order. I expect PINEAPPLE fried rice to have plenty of pineapple. 

Beef was very chewy in the beef red curry. I actually ordered chicken but received beef by mistake. 

Overall I'm sure I will give them more chances and try other dishes. I will update review if things improve but for now, this place is 3 stars. Time to step your game up Valley Thai. Keep in mind you are only 2 miles away from Table Thai which is my favorite place in town. Although you are located within a drunken stumble from my house, it needs to be good value and lots of flavor to get me through football season!"}
{"text":"I've gone once so far and will definitely be going again!! Family owned business the grand children took my order and grandparents made our food in the back, super yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai spot in town and I'm lucky enough to live next to it. Great service, amazing food."}
{"text":"I've lived in Thailand and this food is 100% authentic and excellent!  Service is solid, ambience is so so (but who really goes to a Thai restaurant for ambience anyway).  Best Thai food I've had in the US!"}
{"text":"This place is da bomb! Formerly Sakun Thai, now Valley Thai and the food is amazingly pretty close to authentic...Brings me back home to Bangkok. It's not elegant by any means, but don't let that fool you as the taste of Thai is pretty dang awesome. I ordered the \"Drunken Noodle\" lunch special and it was delicious. I also order \"Tom Yum Noodle soup,\" its a little pricey but well worth the flavors that included 4 shrimp, squid, fishballs, and ground pork. And to top it off, their mango sticky rice was to die for. I actually licked the plate clean. Stop by for lunch its only $7.99 for their specials. Next time, I will have to try a different dish."}
{"text":"Combo Pad Thai was really good. The Pineapple fried rice was okay. The curry flavor added was okay. Maybe the combination was not for me."}
{"text":"Went here with my Dad and even though they had a huge 20 person party, service was on point. We ordered the salad with the peanut sauce, forget the name, and it was really good. I ordered the vegetable drunken noodles and ended up dousing it with the extra peanut sauce we asked for. I forget what my dad ordered but he was content. Servers were super nice and helpful. 
Would definitely go back for both the food and the service"}
{"text":"Amazing food! We had the Pad Thai, Crab Rangoons and the Beef Salad. Everything tasted great. The location looks a bit sketchy at first from the outside, but when you're inside it's very warm and cozy. The food was definitely a 10/10."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in warm springs! My compliments to the chef for delicous and nutritous food. Fast service and helpful staff. All the meals had such beautiful and appetizing display. Never had sweet and sour pork with mushrooms and baby corn but it was amazing! Everything was well balanced with vegtables! Amazing plave! Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying thai food here.  According to the reviews posted here on yelp, they are the best. Not!  They were friendly, nice and the food was ready as the app said it would be. But the pad thai noodles I received must have been the scrap pieces, becausethey were small pieces that were over cooked. The fried rice was spice (did not order spicey). I also ordered the calamari, it was cooked in a sweet tempura but it was rubbery, their valley thai dumplings were good. For the prices the food should be better prepared. Again the service was nice, but I will not go back."}
{"text":"Spicy, tasty and fast service. The meat on the lunch was a little light for my liking, but the flavor was incredible on the drunken noodles, soup and Thai Tea."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for several years. The food is outstanding! I think I've had just about everything on the menu. I love their pad Thai, and drunken noodles. I also love the beef jerky and the fresh rolls! The staff is very nice and they make you feel welcome!!"}
{"text":"I like to come here for lunch. The lunch specials are a great value, the service is always good and fast. 

I only ever get the pad thai which is really good. The portion is sufficient and comes with a few little appetizers. My coworkers alwaya get choose different dishes and the always look really tasty. 

I think some people cruise by this place because of the shopping center it is in and its not very visible. 

Its surprising inside if you judge it from the outside. 

Dont sleep on this spot."}
{"text":"The service here is incredible. Still love their Tom Kah soup! They know my order and they are willing to make changes to my order. I really appreciate their attention to detail and friendly dispositions."}
{"text":"Anytime I am feeling under the weather I order the veggie Tom Yum soup and it seems to pick me right back up. Valley Thai is a delicious and authentic restarting that offers a vegetarian menu, which is pretty rare here in Las Vegas. Every friend I've recommended to try this place absolutely loved it! My main order is usually veggie Tom Yum soup, veggie Pad Thai or Pad See Ew and sweet sticky rice. Through in the thai tea and it's a wonderful day for me! I need to try more things but every time I come by I crave my classic order. Thank you for the great food and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"We got yellow curry chicken level 3 but it seemed more of a level of 4. The kung pao chicken was decent but nothing to write home about. Overall was decent for the price."}
{"text":"Tried this new place this evening ... And let me just say I am not disappointed !!!  First walk-in impression, The ambiance is very cozy and inviting! I loved it ! 
After being seated I ordered Mermaid Tails, Crab Rangoons, Curry Puffs, some Beef Noodle Soup (Sorry for forgetting the actual name!) [UPDATE: commonly known as boat noodle soup] and some Orange Chicken and rice for my son.  Staff is very friendly, it is wonderful that this place is run by a family !  

The food arrived quickly and it was HOT !! Freshly made and was absolutely stunning ! The plating was gorgeous, and the authentic flavors literally melted in my mouth.   Let me just say that their Crab Rangoons are literally THE BEST Rangoons I've ever had !!! I couldn't get enough of them ! Even my 5 year old wanted more !  I could've ate my fill in Rangoons alone, they're that GOOD !  The soup came in a big bowl, a portion that is plentiful and filling !  I annihilated the whole bowl and everything was so good I almost wanted to order more ! But I had already eaten so much !  If you want some exceptional home cooked Thai food, this is the place to go !!!"}
{"text":"great dishes, generous portions, sharp taste, the variety of the  menu and spices was a plus, definitely coming back..."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. We checked the yelp reviews and decided to give it a try. I'm glad we did! We tried vegetable spring roll, pad Thai and vegetable drunken noodles. All were very good. We will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Without doubt, one of the best Thai Restaurants in Las Vegas. There's something about their tasty food that makes it 5-steps above the average Thai dining experience. I can't explain it. Let's just say they really take pride in what they do. The staff (made up of mostly family) is very friendly and soft-spoken. The service is flawless. And everything is priced perfectly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went here for the lunch special and the food was pretty good.  I ordered the basil fried rice. The rice was cooked perfect but it could have used some more meat.  I think I counted like 3 small pieces.  The Thai tea was your average cold and sweet confectionary drink.  Other than that, it was $8 for the lunch and a free Thai tea with the check in.  We will come back here if we are ever in the area."}
{"text":"I am so happy to see that this place has so many 5 star reviews, because they DESERVE IT!  I have to admit when I fist came to this restaurant I was a little scared, and did not expect much from the outside appearance. Thai is without a doubt my favorite food and Valley Thai is without a doubt my favorite Thai restaurant. I have never had the chance to Dine in, however I have called for a to go order at least 15 times in the past two months. Its really THAT good. I am in love with the Spicy Basil Beef. I have never had Spicy beef this good, o have no idea what they do to it but be warned, every spicy basil dish you have for the rest of your life will be ruined after tasting how Amazing valley Thai does it. I also love love love the Drunken noodle with shrimp. I am a huge fan of spicy food, and I must admit they are not playing around with the 1-5 scale. 3 is almost too much for me. Service is always friendly and although they usually close at 10 they are more than happy to take my call at 9:35. After reading so many awesome reviews I am for sure planning on bringing my girlfriend to dine in very soon!"}
{"text":"So far my favorite Thai place... Their Pad Thai is soooooooo good! The staff is always so pleasant."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite neighborhood Thai restaurant. The yellow curry is excellent. I'd eat it every day. Try the drunken noodles, very good and spicy.  Quick and pleasant service. I recommend this place to anyone who likes Thai food."}
{"text":"Great place to eat some authentic Thai food! Generous portions of food with great presentations.  Had beef Pad Thai and it was delicious! Great flavor in the beef jerky, And the Crab Rangoon were to die for!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. One of the best Thai restaurants I've  experienced here in Vegas.  From customer service , food presentation and overall quality of food. Awesome place packed in a small location."}
{"text":"Came in with my girlfriends for lunch today. We had the chicken pad Thai, pineapple fried rice with shrimp, and some kind of sliced beef in basil sauce. For dessert, of course we had sticky rice with mangoes. EVERYTHING was delicious. 3 of us shared 3 things and still had a lot of leftover left. Will definitely return. 

Also, if you check In on yelp, you get a free Thai Tea."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai restaurant closed down so we went to Yelp for a suggestion and we are so glad we did. Valley Thai was amazing. The staff was friendly and I really appreciated how they labeled the containers and packed them so they wouldn't leak. We are definitely making them our new favorite Thai restaurant"}
{"text":"Great food! Great staff. I order from this place almost every week. I love the Pad Thai and Pineapple Fried Rice."}
{"text":"Never have a bad experience here and their extensive lunch menu is good enough to satisfy any appetite.  In fact, the inclusion of an egg roll, soup, and veggie-filled wonton chip with each lunch special makes the $7.99 price tag a steal.

The pad thai my wife orders is a large portion and she seemingly splits it into two meals every time she gets it.  The flavor is great and I find myself stealing a few bites.

I tend to go for the pad kra pow pork or beef.   It's essentially grounded beef or pork in a spicy mint/basil sauce served with rice.  A spicy level of 3 out of 5 gives a very nice kick to the dish.

Service is very friendly and very fast.  We've had a few minor hiccups at times like asking for no bean sprouts and then receiving a double dose of bean sprouts on the pad thai.  Small things in the grander scheme of things.

It's our go-to spot near by and there's enough tasty looking dishes on the menu to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Very nice people. Great service. Food was excellent too. I love supporting small businesses and this place feels like a hole in the wall, but in a good way!"}
{"text":"I wish I could award more than 5 stars. I order delivery from The Valley Thai so much because it is so good! Fast service and delicious food. My personal favorites are the pad Thai and drunken noodles, but everything I have ordered from here is great!"}
{"text":"Meh. I've ordered from here a few times and tonight will be my last. Their spicy levels are off. Never consistent. That annoys me. 

A 3 is like a 7 anywhere else and I LOVE spicy food. Their Massaman curry was very greasy this time. When last time it was overly dry/overcooked where it seemed old or microwaved. 

I understand there is a language barrier sometimes, but I asked for a peanut sauce to be excluded on the summer rolls and the sauce showed up open and all over the rolls and bag. We had someone here with allergies so we couldn't risk the cross contamination. 

Overall the place isn't the worst, but the inconsistency makes me apprehensive about ordering from there again. 

The beef jerky was actually tasty, but it arrived iced cold. I did heat it up which made it better, but the whole point of ordering out is not worrying about cooking.. right? 

Eh. Happy yelping"}
{"text":"Newly opened, nice and airy inside with a lot of tables. We decided to try them out for lunch and most of the entrees are $8.99-$9.99 served with complimentary soup that had mushrooms and a slightly strong fish sauce (but tasty) and a veggie eggroll! Pricing is a little high my opinion since most places are around $6.99-$8.99 but $10 a person for higher quality food still beats a fast food drive up anyday for me so it's all good. The only thing is that I don't see any meat replacement options (tofu, faux meat, vegetable, etc.) for vegetarians or any specified vegan options but when I asked if they could do veggies instead of meat they said no problem :) they also have spiciness levels from 1-5 and from what we got I thought the spiciness was pretty accurate to what I think the number would taste like. 

Tom Kha Veggie $5.99 - Not as creamy as I prefer, kind of on the watery side and the coconut was pretty overwhelming as if it wasn't cooked down enough. I also wish there was more of a citrus or lime flavor. Spiciness was good though. 

Panang Curry Veggie $8.99- Also had a watered down flavor and consistency. They gave me a lot of veggies though and the spiciness was good but I will say there was more spice than flavor. 

Overall with so many Thai places in the area and a higher price point for lunch specials, I prefer Table Thai or Siri Thai."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in Vegas!! Went here for dinner today and the atmosphere and service were excellent.  We ordered the drunken noodle, Panang curry, Pad thai, calamari, and crab rangoon.  Every dish was delicious, with great flavors and cooked wonderfully! I would especially recommend the crab rangoon as an appetizer, it had a great crunch to it and you could really taste how flavorful and fresh the crab is! 

The panang curry was great as well, I ordered it with chicken. The meat and vegetables were cooked just right and really brought out the spicy flavor and seasoning of the curry.  You can order your food from spice level 1-5, I tried the 2 and the 3 which was just right if you want a good amount of heat to your dish without sweating.

For dessert we got the fried iced cream which was AMAZING! The fried exterior really complimented the sweetness of the ice cream and they even set it on fire right in front of you! I will definitely be coming back here whenever I'm in the mood for Thai cuisine.  You can tell they care about quality ingredients and good cooking here. Overall a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Great food.   Service was great and the place is very clean with a good atmosphere.  
If you want really spicy food this is the place.  The pad Thai was spicy hot.   Ordered 5 spicy on the menu and it was great on flavor and spiciness."}
{"text":"Pat and the other host was pleasant. We were greeted with a smile. We did not have to wait a long time for food. Delicious! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had the pad Thai and the Thai fried rice, both with chicken.  The spice range is 1 through 5 and I picked 3.  I got just a slight burn on my lips.  MMM. I have been traveling across town for Thai food and now I am finding it in my own backyard!  Everything was prepared perfectly and I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My favorite local Thai place. Great food, great service and great lunch special prices."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Thai food.  Unique duck dishes.  I ordered the kuaydiaw duck, it was authentic and full of flavor.  Great price great customer service."}
{"text":"Another delicious meal at The Valley Thai. I decided to spice it up (pun intended) and go for a level 3 Pad Gra Pow - Beef. It was incredible! Very flavorful, and I was especially thankful for the brown rice to help soothe the spiciness I requested!! Overall, another 5/5 stars."}
{"text":"This place had a high potential to be a 5 star but the order was screwed up. The food was delicious and the price was expensive, but that's Vegas. Everything has to be slightly overpriced. Anyways, once the check came, we were charged DOUBLED for each item we ordered. The total came out to be $300 and thank god we caught the mistake. I was content with the food but the mistake was too large to be ignored.."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Valley Thai! I go here for lunch and it's always fast service and great food. They have a really good selection and the servers are always nice. Pretty sure everybody that works there is family. Be careful when you order the 5 spice level because grandma cooking in the back doesn't play around. I've had the Thai fried rice, Mongolian Chicken,  Pad Thai and Panang Curry and they were all awesome. They also give a free Thai tea if you check in."}
{"text":"Good Thai food, great Thai tea, and nice atmosphere.  If you are at the bar a few doors down, they deliver.  They don't serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for the first time tonight!!!! What took me so long to find this place so close to home?!? Everything was hot! The crunchy food was still crunchy when it got here too. 

We ordered orange chicken, beef and chicken satay as well as Thai Chicken Fried Rice - everything was so yummy!

If they u are considering ordering from here - do it! I will make them a regular delivery for us!"}
{"text":"The food comes quickly is delicious and the wait staff is very nice. Overall a very affordable Thai experience. My favorite is the pad Thai at level 5. Yummy"}
{"text":"I love Thai basil.It is Thai authentic food and family owned it.I highly recommend this restaurant.Best service in town."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times since they changed ownership and what an improvement! Staff is always friendly. Takeout is quick. The food is traditional and delicious. I'm a Thai food snob and I'm so happy to see this business hanging in there."}
{"text":"The food was very good, the girl was nice, our thai tea and coffee was tasty.  I drank my entire coffee and immediately fell asleep for 3 hours so there's a chance it was decaf.

Food was pricy for take out.

I'm only taking a star off because the straws and utensils are so cheap that my straw ended up cracking and ruining my clothes with coffee.  I then took my boyfriend's straw and right at the end of my coffee it also broke and got more on my shirt.

I couldn't use the free thai tea coupon from here because we had already spent a high enough amount to get one of ours free."}
{"text":"Service was great! Food is very delicious and although business seems slow they met my expectations with food but they exceed my expectations with there service. I ordered Panang with rice along with some curry puffs which happened to be my favorite part."}
{"text":"Hats off and a round of applause to this darling little family that does an AMAZING job from the origami napkins, friendly service, clean atmosphere, the soothing Thailand music to the scrumptious food that's served hot, fresh and generous!
Orange chicken was hot, crunchy, tangy and tasty with wedges of fresh orange slices to nibble on. Pad Thai noodles and the Beef salad was so full of flavor, I just couldn't stop eating to take a picture to share my yelp friends.
To add the cherry on top, the little guy gave me a free Thai Iced Tea that hit the spot on a hot summer night.
Thank you Valley Thai for showing Vegas how its done right. You outshine all Thai restaurants in my book."}
{"text":"If you love thai food. This place is it!  I came here with my roommate and was greeted warmly and seated.  I love that it's family own and makes you feel like home.  We tried the curry puffs and fried mermaid shrimp for apps. Bomb. I love the curry puffs how there so soft and flaky. 
For entree we had the salmon green curry, duck tamarind, and andaman seafood!   Everything was so delish!!! Salmon came out perfect ! And the tamarind flavor with duck tastes great! And andaman seafood came out fancy with a foil swan.  And seafood inside.  For dessert we had a little platter with custard over sticky rice and fried bananas and fresh mangos!   Great dinner. Love atmosphere and quick service! Makes you feel like you're in a little part of Thailand. Def will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great and really helpful! Curry Puffs, Beef Jerky, and Fried Ice Cream were my favorites but the entrees were all good as well. Definitely going back:)"}
{"text":"This is our thai home! We love the owners and their daughter. Their food is delicious every time! No matter what you order it is so yummy, so friendly and they know my daughter and I by name, even down to what we order! I love that we have found a home that makes unbelievable food and offers such a welcoming experience!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service.  Had the Panang curry with shrimp. Go light on the spicy level. I like spicy and a 3 would have been overboard.  We will bw back!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here has been great. If your looking for good Thai this is the spot, always a welcome experience, quick service, and they keep it classy and stick to their own recipe which is delicious. Excellent pad Thai, pineapple fried rice, curry and Thai tea. So grateful they're close to home.."}
{"text":"The Valley Thai takes over Sakun Thai restaurant with a new menu and focus on \"East Side\" Thai food. Not to be confused with the East Side of Las Vegas, but the East Coast of the US where the family is from, New Jersey.

The food here is amazing. We tried so many amazing things that were just stand outs from other Thai restaurants which are becoming so popular in the city.

We started off with four apps: the mermaid tails, their Thai dumplings both steamed and fried, and their curry puffs. These were all awesome and unique. Their shrimp app features a deep fried ham wrapped shrimp. Their shu mai offer a house made and wrapped dumpling with an incredible filling. The curry puffs were the star of the meal. Poke a hole in the puff and add some of the sweet and sour cucumber salad and wow!

We got chicken yellow curry, chicken pad se ewe, chicken Tom kha, and duck salad to have family style and the portions were pretty big. At this point I stopped taking pictures because I was just enjoying my food. With all the appetizers these four items plus white rice fed our party of 5 until we were stuffed and we still had left overs to take home.

The chicken curry was a favorite with all of the ingredients cooked perfectly. The chicken pad de ewe was seasoned perfectly. The Tom kha Gai was light and refreshing and not heavy on the coconut milk.

The stand out was the duck salad. I've never had this at a Thai restaurant. It was amazing. Crispy duck, fresh herbs, and pineapple. This cold salad was so good. 

For dessert we had fried bananas and their version of fried ice cream. 

Again I've never had fried ice cream like this. The crust was buttery and flaky and the ice cream in the middle was still freezing cold. It was served with some torched liquor and was awesome. 

Their prices vary from appetizers that are $7 to some high quality seafood dishes at $17/$18 and everything in between. Their space, although still under renovations, was clean. Their staff was nice and their food was awesome. They have som crave-worthy items for sure. This isn't a hole in the wall and definitely date worthy and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The food was really good and great portion sizes. We went there for a late lunch walked in and got seated right away. The server was nice. We ordered two different fries rices the basil fried rice and the spicy beef fried rice, along with an eggplant dish with your choice of meat which we chose chicken. The meal started with soup, a fried wonton, and a mini egg roll for each of us. All were really good however the I wish they would have been explained to us as to what they were when we asked the server didn't really know what was in the soup. I would have expected her to know something simple like that. The meals came out quickly and tasted amazing. Be careful when they ask about how spicy you would like your dish it's on a scale 1-5 and everyone got a 3 or 3.5 and it was really spicy. I would suggest going with more of a two. After we finished eating we sat there for about 10 minutes we had to find the server to come over and get us boxes and the check as we were the only people in the place I would have expected her to be a bit more on top of it. All in all if you're looking for authentic Thai food off the hustle and bustle of the Las Vegas strip this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Little gem...good food, service fast and friendly!!
Very clean place. White linens too!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to the have thai food. Don't let the location fool you this is a great place."}
{"text":"Going back for sure. Food, service & atmosphere was very good. It was our first time there & everyone was so nice. Drunken Noodles hit the spot."}
{"text":"Went in tonight to grab some dinner...it wasn't busy at all. I had the drunken noodles spice level 2. If you can't handle spice I recommend getting level 1 because I was so surprised at how much heat was in there. It was really good though. The service was great too! The two waitresses were very nice and attentive!"}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot but now it is somewhat out of my way, but it's an amazing Thai restaurant in town, everything on the menus is good, I'd recommend their curry and mixed veggies. The lunch specials come with wonton, soup/salad, egg roll and they serve your food so quick that you can make it back to work on time :). I love their staff and they are super friendly"}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite Thai Place in Vegas. The staff is great and the food is incredible. Don't forget to order yourself a Thai iced tea when you stop in"}
{"text":"Great food! We had the Spaghetti Keep Mao and the Pad Thai both spicy level 4 out of 5. It was definitely true to Thai spicy. For scalability to a 10 or scale, it was closer to a 9 out of 10. 

We also got the Fried Ice Cream, as recommended by other reviewers and the Fried Bananas and the fired ice cream was so delicious!! They pour alcohol on it and light it up! Very cool presentation. The fried bananas were my fav!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing, the staff was super sweet and attentive. They have a lot of different Thai foods that I hadn't tried before and of course the classic dishes. We got the fried mermaid, curry puffs and beef jerky to start and they were all super good but I really loved the curry puffs, the crust was on point. The duck salad was super flavorful and crispy and the Penang curry had great taste. We were super impressed with the fried ice cream, they lit it on fire on the table! The server said they were renovating, so I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with the place."}
{"text":"Amazing! The spring rolls were delicious and the duck sauce was amazing. Will defiantly come back!"}
{"text":"This was mediocre Thai food. The shrimp in the red curry tasted like mineral tap water. The pad Thai was more peanuty than any I've ever had before and overwhelming. However, the crab wontons were really good. At the end of the meal I felt I paid for high quality and ended up with mediocre. I will be trying to find another Thai restaurant to frequent."}
{"text":"First time here, great food & good service! From the outside doesn't look like much but the food makes up for it. I asked for a 3 and was not too spicy for me but if you're not used to spicy ask for a two or below."}
{"text":"Very nice deco, friendly server. Food was beyond perfect. If you can eat spicy food choose #5 for the spicy level. Really love the food and service here would definitely come back again when we visit las vegas again"}
{"text":"My take out order was ready earlier than quoted and I was greeted immediately when I walked in. The woman was extremely friendly and prompt and was very knowledgeable of the menu. The Green Curry and Black Pepper beef were amazing and I loved the brown rice. Just a heads up: the level 2 is pretty spicy!! Great for us but maybe too hot for sensitive people."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior, the strip mall, or the basic looking menu fool you. The food here is delicious and spice lovers will absolutely fall in love with this place. Low key, good service, great flavors. 

Only negative was the music. It's light enough to ignore but it started out with 3-4 people acoustically covering Maroon 5, then \"have yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" (but it's October). Random. 

Great place."}
{"text":"The restaurant is owned and operated by a family from New Jersey.  There were no other customers on the Thursday evening of our visit, no doubt attributable to its location in a commercial section of town, though there were a few takeout orders.  We started off with fried mermaids -  shrimp, ham and scallions wrapped in rice paper that have been deep fried and served with a sweet and sour sauce.  Our shared entrees were spicy eggplant with chicken and pad se ew with shrimp.  Each dish was prepared with fresh ingredients, visually appealing and delicious"}
{"text":"Valley is one of my favorite thai joints in town! The service was exceptional! Some of my favorites on the menu are the curry puffs and the tamarind duck. Don't forget about dessert as you'll be in for a surprise when you get the fried ice cream. Valley thai is more than just a neighborhood joint. Their approach to east side thai style is different for all the other thai restaurants in Vegas. Definitely give them a try! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! I love the Fresh Valley Thai roll and after so much ordering there this week, they added more mint, which was great! Also, bae loves their orange chicken, which I also now love. And their drunken noodles are also a fave. While I'm moving further west, I hope to come back any time I am in Henderson. Thanks for making moving week less stressful with prompt delivery and great food :)"}
{"text":"This is the best place for Thai food in Las Vegas! The food was fast, inexpensive and delicious. And it's not too far from the strip. Go for the lunch special and if you post on Yelp you get a free drink!"}
{"text":"The curry puffs are great! One time I ordered chicken pad see ew and received chicken pad Thai instead. It was good, but I wish I had received the dish I had ordered. The online ordering is so easy and the food is always ready on time. This place also has really good Thai iced tea!"}
{"text":"A very good thai restaurant with authentic thai food at reasonable price. Try the lunch special green curry fried rice."}
{"text":"We have Chicken Tom kha today.I would come back again.It is very good.Severs are great."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. Ordered the seafood tom yum, chicken pad Thai, and orange chicken. oMg it was all soo good, but the orange chicken was the best I have ever had.  Highly recommend,  there was only 1 other couple, nice quiet, soft music   And a great over all experience"}
{"text":"Upon the recommendation of someone who claimed to have been to lots of Thai restaurants and that \"this one is the absolute best!\" I ordered on-line three different entrees off their vegetarian menu for pickup.   About a minute after I placed the order via a web page, my phone rang & it turned out  to be the restaurant, wanting to know what sort of meat I wanted in the Mussaman Curry that I ordered.

Hmm, I did order if off their \"Vegetarian\" menu, however,  one of the items listed on their \"Vegetarian\" menu was something cooked in oyster sauce.   I think the stereotype about Asians not really understanding the concept of vegan/vegetarian is correct...

Anyway, I asked her for tofu in the curry, and then headed to the restaurant.  Arriving about 22 minutes after I placed the order, it was ready & waiting for me.   It was only as I picked-up my order did the hostess ask me whether or not I'd wanted eggs in my fried rice dish.  I told her yes, but they hadn't put any in, & of course by now it was too late... I wish that she'd asked me on the phone, when she called to ask what sort of \"meat\" I wanted in my vegetarian Mussaman Curry!

The small restaurant seemed clean with the usual basic Thai ambience to it, but had no diners at about 8PM on a Wednesday evening.


The three entrees I'd ordered --- a curry dish, a noodle dish, & a fried rice dish, were all OK, yet not great.  All were ordered spicy -- 3 or 4 on a scale of 5, but the only one that was actually somewhat spicy was the rice dish, which I'd asked to be a level 4.    Couldn't detect the heat in either of the other dishes.   Portion size was completely normal for what I've gotten at dozens of other Thai take-outs over the years, except the Mussaman Curry portion was a little low.

I realize that as a vegetarian, I'm  missing out on the ubiquitous FISH SAUCE that's a normal ingredient in just about every Asian food dish, particularly Thai food, & it's unfortunately the fish sauce that provides a basic flavor.   None of the three entrees I ordered really had much flavor to them, and I've eaten vegetarian Thai food from dozens & dozens of other places over the decades that were able to provide great flavor, plus spiciness.

If Valley Thai were closer to my home (there are probably at least 20 other Thai places that are closer -- I LOVE this area!!), I'd be happy to try them again, knowing from my initial experience that I need to tell them that egg in my rice, etc. is OK, and to kick the spiciness up to a level 5 (in order to hope that there's even a little heat -- a common problem at Thai restaurants around here, I guess they're afraid of stupid people that order it really spicy, then complain that it's really spicy).     But instead, I'll keep ordering Thai food from the couple places in the area that are able to make it with a good balance of flavor + heat, plus keep trying new Thai places."}
{"text":"It was okay but I don't think I'll be back. I missed not being able to order a beer with my meal. The restroom was dirty."}
{"text":"Service is awesome, food is delicious, atmosphere is very vibrant. Our server was Belle, and she pretty cool. For first timers who loves noodles I recommend pad Thai or drunken noodle. Besides entree, I had the crab rangoon, which was extra rangoonie, that's a plus, and the fried calamari, Thai tea was specially great, it wasn't watery like other restaurants, and for dessert I had Fried Ice Cream and mango sticky rice! Enjoyed them both, highly recommend having your Thai food cravings fulfilled here! =D"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and good size portions for the price! Found my new Thai spot for food"}
{"text":"Second time getting take out , I was not disappointed! I don't usually have high expectations when I'm getting takeout , cause it's never as fresh as eating at the restaurant. That being said I have gotten takeout twice from this place and both times it has been hot fresh and delicious!!! I got a little bit of everything and it was all good. Every dish and appetizer was prepared perfectly and sooo very good.. I will definitely be making this a regular on my dinner menu!






Well we order from here all the time for takeout and it never disappoints!!! Dinner was yet again great! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely hate giving out a one star rating, but something has to be said. I have never felt more unwelcomed and completely ignored in a local business before. I came here with my mom because we love Thai cuisine and love trying new places. It was lunch and they had a good amount of customers. I did notice a young lady working the front alone. Poor thing;  however, her actions (or lack of) are unacceptable. She sat us in a booth and that was the extent of the \"service.\" Within a few minutes of perusing the menu we closed the booklets and left them at the edge of our table. For the next 20+ minutes I waited and waited to order. We even made eye contact several times from afar. I even did a hand wave with a smile. Her response was walking back into the kitchen. When she came out of the kitchen she took orders from two tables who came after us and performed other tasks like serving water and thai iced to others. Hungry and tired of waiting to even order, my mom and I got up and left. The lady watched us leave, again more eye contact, but continued silence. Completely unapologetic. 

More reasons why I am pissed:
- In that 20+ minutes, no stops at our table to even ask \"Are you ready to order?\" Or \"Sorry, we're busy today and short staffed.\" 
- I watched her provide normal customer service to other tables and we had none. 

With dismal service and many more Thai restaurants out there, we will never come back. Our friends and family know not to come here either. It is apparent that Valley Thai never wanted our business to begin with.

{"text":"Come in for lunch. This was my first time here and it was great !!! Came here for business lunch and it was great. The music is nice and calm, service is with a smile and quick. I have been to a few Thai restaurant's and this one is in the upper rating that's for sure. 
Be aware their hot goes from 1-5 and does get hot at 4 :)"}
{"text":"So good. Great service. Bill was easy on the wallet. Got 5 aps  (Thai dim sum) 3 entrees. Just really good. Perplexed to be the only ones there."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food in my neighborhood. Just have to stress the importance of the spice heat scale."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The flavors and service were comparable if not better than the best Thai food in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite restaurants to dine at, for any meal of the day. I've visited here quite a few times before writing my review, and I can honestly say every one of my visits have been some of the most comfortable and pleasant dining experiences I've ever had. The servers are always so welcoming and attentive, and service overall feels very personal.

Immediately when walking in, I am promptly greeted and sat at my table. It has a nice dim-lit ambiance at nights, which makes it a great place for a quiet and romantic night out. The server takes my drink orders, and is quick to bring said drink right to my table and keep it full until I leave. The food presentation is worthy of taking pictures to post on your Instagram (Don't act like you won't), but the taste of the food is even better than it looks. 

I have tried venturing out in their menu by ordering something different with every visit. I have not been disappointed by a single dish. If passion and dedication were ingredients in their food, I'd say they added those with a heavy hand. Giving my opinion about every item I've tried on the menu would make this review much longer than anyone would care to read, so I'll just highlight my favorite items:

For appetizers, I order curry puffs almost every single time I visit! Little curry stuffed pastries, deep fried with a perfectly flaky crust and served with a saucer of cucumber salad. The server explained to me that the ingredients are made from scratch, and ridges at the edge of the curry puffs are rolled by hand.
For salads, I have ordered the duck salad upon recommendation, and I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was. Typically, I  see salads as bland, and leaves me unsatiated. The duck salad was explosive with flavor, and definitely something I'd order again in a future visit.
For entrees, I find myself ordering the beef Pad Gra Pow over and over again. Ground beef with spicy Thai basil sauce (and I always order fried egg to go with it), served with rice. It's one of those dishes I'm randomly get cravings for time and time again. Bear in mind their spiciness scale goes from 1-5. I LOVE spicy foods, but I don't order anything higher than a 2, otherwise I start sweating and crying.
For desserts, I recommend you get the fried ice cream, and make sure you have your Snapchat ready. Trust me on that one. ;)

If I could give this restaurant any more than 5 stars, I would. I highly recommend giving this place a visit. Great quality food and a fine dining experience for a great price! I love it!"}
{"text":"Sat down to order and a roach fell on my plate... No thanks we'll pass! Place was empty and now I know why."}
{"text":"We enjoyed eating at this restaurant very much.Every dish we ordered was tasty and fresh.       Server were friendly.This restaurant is hidden Jem!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered some Thai food to our room while we were staying out in Vegas. My husband wasn't feeling well so we ordered him some Tom Yum Soup. The soup was flavorful with a little spice and we both enjoyed it.

We had also ordered the Fresh Valley Thai Roll to split. The rolls are described as Mixed vegetables and bean thread noodles mixed with shrimp stuffed into a rice wrapper with semi-sweet sauce and peanut. Our order provided us with three huge rolls. The rolls were flavorful and I would order again in a heartbeat. 

For my meal, I ordered the green shrimp curry. This delicious meal was described as: Green curry in coconut milk with bamboo shoot, string bean, bell peppers and Thai basil leaves. I had messed up my order when i ordered online because I forgot to indicate what level of spice I wanted. However, it didn't matter because my meal was flavorful and very filling. The shrimp was plentiful surprisingly enough since most restaurants provide when you order shrimp will be between 3-6. I probably had between 8-12 big shrimps in my curry. Score!

Overall a pretty solid Thai place and would order again."}
{"text":"I usually get yellow curry level 3 for a really nice sweet and spicy mouthfeel and when I got theirs it was easily a level 5, my mouth burned and I couldn't even finish it. It was a to go order so I couldn't exchange it either. I got the lunch portion and the little appetizer sides it came with were disappointing as well. The free Thai tea with check in was GREAT. 

Had tried to come here once before during business hours and they were closed. Will all the Thai places around I'm unlikely to try this place again anytime soon. Really pretty ambiance from what I saw though. Overall it was an ok place with an ok experience. Good prices."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place. The Pad Thai was too sweet for my taste but the eggplant dish...MY GOD! Spicy level 4 was real spicy but not crazy. This dish is insanely good. Two thumbs way up"}
{"text":"First and foremost the service is great. The waitress was very kind and came around a few times to make sure we were doing ok, which always makes for a happy experience. 

Pros: 
Portions are large so it makes up for the higher price
Overall the lighting and table layout is very nice and inviting and romantic 
Amazing service 
Clean
Now the food!!! 
We ordered the mussels level 2 and they were the perfect amount of spice with the mussels being very hot and not chewy. The spring rolls veggie style (its also available with shrimp) they were crispy flavorful. Our entrees were tamarind duck... which for $16.99 was more than I could ask for. It was crispy yet soft meat. It was also went very well with the tamarind and didnt get lost in the flavor which was great. We also enjoyed the drunken noodles $10.99 level 2 which was perfectly cooked with very wide noodle which is our favorite and hard to find. 

Cons: well happy to say there was none!! 

This is a must try for thai lovers!!!"}
{"text":"Omg!!!! The food was excellent and the people were very friendly! I'm from Cali and have been here for a few days, so I was looking for some good Thai food! This was great! Everything about it was good! I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Flew in from Denver wanted some Thai food found this restaurant on yelp
Order from lunch menu and Phi Thai very good would say best I ever had bur very good.  Lady at counter was very nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. We went today, they kindly asked about our son who's in school. I had the Duck Red Curry and it was great. Plenty of flavor and not oily at all. The service was friendly as always. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple of days ago and this restaurant was a great mom and pop Thai restaurant. They offer a free Thai tea if you check in and the tea was amazing. The food was really good and reasonably priced. The service was amazing, the hostess came by a couple of time and checked in on us. She even offered to have the food redone because it seemed like we were struggling with the spice which was very thoughtful. You're not going to get anything fancy with the atmosphere but you shouldn't expect that with a small mom and pop place like this. Overall I recommend eating here. I know I will surely be back, I absolutely loved the Thai tea."}
{"text":"Another great experience here. First had dinner here about a month ago. Dine in experience was great. Tonight I decided I wanted Thai food and placed my order at 9:04. She was here in 30 minutes. No lie! Food tastes just as great as when I dined in and my Thai iced tea is still delicious. Love love love this place. 

For reference: I ordered combination fried rice and chicken satay."}
{"text":"This is a great hidden gem for Thai food! We have been stopping in here a few times a month for the last few months and it's always great food! The dumplings are fantastic as is the crab fried rice,cashew chicken and orange chicken.(some of the current favorites) the only way you can make it better is to bring more people so you can go family style and order a bunch of entrees to share!! Only think to watch out for is the spicy factor, love me some heat but that heat scale gets hot quick."}
{"text":"Although we were dubious at first due to the location, we decided to listen to the many positive yelp reviews and give it a try. We were pleasantly surprised. We ordered a couple different curries, chicken satay, the appetizer sampler, and pad Thai. Everything was delicious. The free thai tea with check in was a tasty bonus, as well. The only reason for one star being knocked off was that every dish was supposed to be mild (1), but was too spicy for our taste. The prices were reasonable, and was both one of our least expensive and most delicious meals during our stay in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best thai resturant in Vegas. . My fav dish was chicken fried rice and drunken noodle, yummy yummy"}
