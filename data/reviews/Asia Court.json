{"text":"Great selection of Asian food ranging from Thai, Japanese, Vietnamese and Chinese.  The food isn't heavy on oil and doesn't contain MSG which is something I always avoid.  I had the General Tso's chicken and it was good.  It cold have been spicier but nonetheless it was rather tasty."}
{"text":"Now don't get me wrong this place has very friendly staff and seemed clean enough, it's just they say they specialize in Thai and I found that most of the dishes were chinese.  I have been craving Thai for a while and since this place was close to me and the reviews in another forum were good (never trust a non yelp review) i figured I would give it a try.  What they called Pad See Eew was actually a pretty bland Pad Tai.  I ordered the Crab Rangoon (chinese) and they forgot to put the oreder in so I cant comment on that.  The wife got the Honey walnut shrimp (chinese) and was dissapointed to see that the walnuts were crushed and sprinkled over the top and now candied as the menu stated.  I think the Menu in this case was just a guideline for the Cook and he or she would get as close to the dish as possible without actually making exactly what you ordered.  Needless to say I probably will not go back here at least not if I want what I ordered."}
{"text":"Asia court has closed. In its place is Jumbo II. This is a totally different restaurant. Different owners. Some minor decor updates have been done. The menu has been changed. Also gone is the small bar section of the restaurant. it is replaced with a buffet table that will be used for lunch service. Reopened in the drive thru window. Order your food via phone pick it up at the drive thru. Never get out of your  car."}
