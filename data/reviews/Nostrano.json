{"text":"Non-pretentious decor and friendly staff.  Also, great food.   We thought that the bread, desserts and snapper brodetto were particularly amazing."}
{"text":"Great dinner. The charcuterie board was excellent. The roasted quail was the best I've ever had. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a casual dinner with excellent food."}
{"text":"Good service and excellent food.  I really don't mind the prices because you are getting good quality food prepared with love.  I have had Short Ribs, Seafood Brodetto(sp?).  All very good.  I like that the menu focuses on a few things that they do well.  They also have a good beer list.  We are spoiled in Madison that we can find excellent beers at most of the decent places in town."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Everything I've ever ordered here was above and beyond expectations. i'm not a dessert eater but i NEVER skip dessert here. I think it's the best restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"This was just fine.  I enjoyed myself, very good service.  Food (had pasta as had been recommended) and cocktails were just fine, but didn't knock my socks off.  Was chilly inside (on a pretty warm night) and hardly a soul in there.  Best thing about it?  THE BREAD.

If it were a bit less expensive, it would be a 4 star review.  But it just doesn't rise to the level of its price point."}
{"text":"I will start by saying the food is good - unique combinations, elegant presentation, and overall good taste. However, the price tag and the culinary delights are NOT worth putting up with the poor service!

I do not eat meat and I asked the waitress if a dish could be made vegetarian. She really didn't want to accommodate me and suggested that the chef doesn't like to either and so even though I had told her I would order something else, she begrudgingly told me they would make the dish vegetarian for me. Overall, she was apathetic and not welcoming. We waited close to an hour for our food with a party of 4 and the restaurant not too full. 

I had made a reservation ahead of time for us since we were out celebrating a bachelorette party and they also made no special accommodation/acknowledgment of this. Finally we ordered dessert, simple gelato, and it took an additional excessively long time to arrive. I am very unimpressed with the overall experience and would caution other people from going to Nostrano, especially not to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"Contrary to the info on Yelp, Nostrano is open for lunch.  While the menu is more limited than dinner, it has many of the same options, but a whole lot cheaper.  The whitefish sandwich and the smoked pork shank sandwich we had were superb!  They come with a delicious salad of mixed greens and baby veggies.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food. Awesome desert. But a bit pricey"}
{"text":"Note: make reservations as seating is limited.

I think my dinner at Nostrano during Madison Restaurant Week may have been the best food I have had in Madison. This restaurant is a gem.

The waiter was incredibly nice and helpful. He was very knowledgeable on the wines and beers. We had a blast interacting with him, and I think he made the experience so much more positive.

I ordered the orecchiette with game bird sausage, and the dish was scrumptious. The slices of fiore sardo added nice texture to the soft orecchiette. For dessert, I had the Gianduja Chocolate Cremeux, and I loved it. If you like milk chocolate and creme brulee, this is for you.

The Sazerac was high quality, made with the rare Willet reserve (5 year single barrel rye), and I am definitely ordering more of their cocktails the next time I go.

Nostrano is the anti-local local restaurant. If you're looking for Wisconsin-style food or a local brew, go elsewhere. I'm sure the restaurant uses local ingredients, but they definitely don't have your standard cheese curds and Spotted Cow. That said, the food is great as well as the service if you're willing to shell out the money."}
{"text":"I have to change the rating after returning a year later to a lackluster dinner.  I had the \"rabbit gnocchi\" which consisted of 6 gnocchi and a huge sausage.  The waitress's description of this plate in no way matched what was served.  The menu seemed  overly complicated and overpriced.  On a positive note, the desserts were still tasty, although pricy too."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a gift certificate there, which was great because this is a pricey place. The service is excellent and the food is mostly to die for. We had the squash soup and the scallops as appetizers, and both were totally amazing. My husband got the lamb parpadelle and I got the tagliatelle. The reason this is not a 5 star review is because I was not blown away my my tagliatelle. It was so close to being great, but was just fairly bland -- honestly, it could have been something as simple as just not having enough salt. Other than that, everything including drinks and wine were fantastic. Dessert was great, although again my husband's affogato was far better than my basque cake. Go there, and get the affogato. One of the best desserts I've ever sampled. I want to go back and get my own!"}
{"text":"Going to school here 15 years ago, I didn't expect much of anything in the culinary scene in Madison...boy was I wrong. 

I had one of the best bowls of pasta in years here (with the lamb ragout). My fiance had the seafood stew, and we started with the bison carpaccio. All were great, as good as we get in our hometown of NYC. 

On top of this, the drinks were great- I really enjoyed the old fashioned (both of them). 

Everyone was great! Matt and Julie took great care of us during our meal. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Again, a magnificent meal at Nostrano. I was very pleased to see the dinner hopping tonight, it has been underappreciated on other afternoons and evenings I've visited.
This is a very special restaurant, a place that will not settle for anything less than the best in anything it serves. I want to make a special shout-out for Jessie, the bartender extraordinaire. As I told her this evening, I love to watch someone do their work with excellence, and she is excellent indeed. She has the subtleties and extra touches to make what she provides that extra special one longs for in one's cocktails and service. My only reservation is: the servers seem to lack the personality and style that befits such a wonderful restaurant. That's not to say they are not good, but seem to lack that extra quality that works for this great place."}
{"text":"Reservation needed, but we were able to dine at the bar. Specialty libations crafted with great success!Radish salad a must have!
Main course of snapper in fennel tomato broth had every secret note of flavor, layer upon layer. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The food here is likely deserving of only three stars, but I've given four because they have exceptional dishes at times and the best dessert in Madison. The food, however, is not consistent. They are bold when it comes to the flavors they combine, and they often miss. For dessert, there was one dish with candied olive or another dish with a far-too-savory cracker that clashed so badly I couldn't believe it had ever been served. With that said, when they get it right, it can be exceptional."}
{"text":"First time visit to Nostrano was very positive.  The wait-staff was incredibly knowledgeable and attentive, the food was unique and tasty, and the bartender was very creative!  There's not a lot of seating, so if you're planning a night out here, I'd highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time.  

The prices are inline with other downtown restaurants, so you shouldn't be too surprised when you get your check.  Overall, I will definitely return here on occasion.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I visited Nostrano with friends on a Friday night and was so disappointed. I had the scallops appetizer, which was tasty but incredibly overpriced given that it was only two scallops. Then for an entree, I ordered the gnochi with pancetta, thinking it was a pasta dish. When it arrived, it was a huge slab of fatty pancetta accented by overly salty vegetables and sauce, and four or five strangely (also heavily salted) fried starch things that were supposed to be gnochi - but clearly not. The best thing of my meal was the wine. The tab (split with my boyfriend who also had the same entree) was around $50 with tip. I was ready to write it off as a disappointing and fairly overpriced meal (particularly for what it was). But then today, I realized that Nostrano charged me again for my meal (5 days later) and at a slightly higher price than I had originally paid. I called immediately and a very nice woman assured me that a manager would call back wihtin the hour to make amends. A few hours passed and no call. I called a SECOND time and was told that it was more convenient for Nostrano to negate the charge tomorrow, and someone would be in touch. 

I would not recommend this restaurant based on the food and would avoid the restaurant based on the service."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we found this gem during a weekend visit to Madison. We're from Chicago, where some fine restaurants can be found, but Nostrano truly impressed. 

I chose the seafood Brodetto, and my wife had the Whole Wheat Pappardelle with lamb ragu, and we were both very pleased with our choices. After finishing our wine, we settled on a polenta copetta to share for desert with our cappuccino. It was wonderful, too. Such unique dishes, yet wonderfully done. Truly exceptional. Our server was Clovis, and she treated us very well, spending quite a bit of time with us and checking back often. All around great evening to cap off our day trip to Madison. 

We walked in on a Friday just as it opened at 5 pm, and were able to get a table.  However, the place was packed by the time we left, so I would recommend making reservations. I would definitely return to Nistrano on our next visit to Madison. That's the easy part. More difficult will be whether to try something else on the menu, or get exactly the same items again!"}
{"text":"Amazing! A perfect place for a birthday dinner! Drinks, apps, and dinner were all delicious and representative of the 'in season' availability. Grilled octopus  was the most tender i have ever had! More importantly, I asked for a special dessert to accommodate someone who was lactose intolerant and it was 'to die for' - olive oil cake, grapefruit, oranges, Meyer Lemon sorbet, candied fennel...a perfect combination of winter fruits and yummy cake! It was an absolutely perfect evening!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal, snapper brodetto was amazing! The waitress was very friendly and helpful... Not a huge white wine person but she helped me to pick a great one that paired perfect with my dinner. Ambience is nice, small, elegant right on the square."}
{"text":"Nostrano can do (almost) no wrong. The food is fresh and creative and delicious (with the exception of the snapper brodetto, which was not very good when I had it). The cocktails are great. The desserts are inspired, particularly the olive oil gelato."}
{"text":"Dined here on a Friday night with my husband. Loved the small intimate space. Started out with a couple cocktails that were perfection. Had Snapper and a Lamb Ragu pasta. Both fantastic. The goat cheese cheesecake was superb. Our waitress was outstanding and really the reason for the 5 stars. She was very knowledgeable and offered opinions when asked. The only drawback was the wine list was a little lacking. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Nostrano is beautifully decorated, and the ambiance is warm and cozy. We had a wonderful time relaxing over drinks and three courses. Our window seat was perfect--love the large wooden window sills! The five stars are especially for the creative, delicious desserts, which were our favorite part of the meal. I had the offagato, which includes yummy cornmeal donuts and salted caramel gelato swimming in espresso. My husband had the crespelle--chestnut crepes filled with sweetened creamy cheese,  with chocolate gelato and figs. Both were beautifully prepared and were unlike the typical offerings on most dessert menus. 

I also enjoyed my entree: delicata squash cannelloni , although if you get this, make sure you let it cool before eating a giant bite like I did--it was piping hot! The marinated olives with sourdough focaccia appetizer is a good deal for $5, and there were plenty of olives and bread for two people to share. Oh, and my husband's cocktail--nehi orange--was really zippy and interesting. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the best food we have had in Madison thus far. The kitchen knows how to put flavor combinations together perfectly, the drinks are amazing and the service was perfect."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Service was unremarkable. Drinks were good. Food portions were very small. Rather pricey."}
{"text":"First time to Nostrano. I read the previous Yelp reviews and I came in with pretty high expectations. Nostrano nailed it. Although being a small and open layout, the restaurant was still quiet and intimate. We started with the Salumi Board, all made in house and out of this world! The service was friendly and they spaced out meal out perfectly. I will most definitely be making more trips to Nostrano in the future, and you should too!"}
{"text":"Worth every penny. Whatever you do, don't skip dessert and coffee. The affogato is highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this new restaurant. The chefs hail from Chicago, and the restaurant has that Chicago feel to it - I think it is a great addition to the Madison scene. 
I ordered the crispy chicken, and it was excellent (de-boned, and perfectly crispy). We also ordered dessert and it was well worth it. 

The atmosphere is great - while I never went to Peppino's, you can tell that the owners put in quite a bit of work to make the area their own. 

I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"The fact that Nostrano doesn't have a solid 5 stars is a disappointment. It is my favorite restaurant in Madison. I completely disagree that it is overpriced. There are certainly more expensive place in Madison, and at Nostrano, I truly feel like I am getting what I pay for. 

The chef here is from a James Beard award winning restaurant in Chicago. (granted it didn't win a James Beard awards when he was there, but I think it reflects the standard it holds) I mention this because the food is not only delicious, it is thoughtful. It is artistic in every sense of the word, from the presentation, conscious of both color and texture, to the curve of the plate it is presented on.  

The food changes with the seasons and is always fresh. The drinks are incredible and creative, ever changing. My favorite part is, you can tell the bartender what you are feeling like and he will make a drink to those specifications, just for you. If you don't like it, he will make you a new one, for free!  The drink making here is also masterful. They cut ice cubes to specifically fit the kind of glass you are drinking from. 

The staff is attentive without being obnoxious. They are well-versed on what they are serving you and can tell you where your food came from and why they are pairing it with whatever is on the plate. They aren't just there to serve you - they are there to educate you, if you so choose. 

Over, all the attention to detail, the comforting and inviting atmosphere, and the excellent staff make Nostrano the definition of a 5-star restaurant."}
{"text":"We were very excited after seeing the restaurant, looking at the menu, and ordering our drinks. Appetizers were great and came out on time. Our server seemed decent...until a) our entrees came no less than 20 minutes after we had FINISHED our appetizers, and he did not apologize or acknowledge the poor servie despite our comments and questions, b) he turned his nose up when I ordered red wine with fish (that stigma is pretty amateur at this point), and c) he AGAIN didn't apologize or acknowledge the poor service when we had to send steak back for being COLD! The food was decent, but not amazing enough to justify the price, especially given the poor, poor service."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. Its highs are really soaring (the charcuterie app, the rabbit boudin, the affogato) and its lows will leave you feeling ripped off (some of the house cocktails, the marinated olive app, the guinea hen, the seafood brodetto, the service). 

Nostrano has committed a few of what are, in my book, unforgivable dining sins. First of all, on one occasion I was served a very well-done portion of Guinea Hen breast. The dish was 100% white meat (a fact which was not indicated on the menu), and it was very dry. The skin and glaze were burned, and all I tasted was charred carbon and dry, mealy meat. It was atrocious. I don't agree with other reviewers who call Nostrano over-priced, but if I'm paying $24 for glorified chicken at least don't subject it to novice culinary errors. 
Secondly, I've received a mixture of average and terrible service here. On the worst occasion, my wife and I stopped in for a low-key meal on a slow Saturday night--more than a few tables were empty throughout our meal--and our server rushed us through our meal in 45 minutes flat. Entrees arrived while we were finishing our appetizer, and the check was brought while we were in the middle of dessert. 
In addition, our waitress was noticeably more friendly to the couple seated next to us; perhaps because they ordered two bottles of wine right off the bat while I only had a cocktail and my (pregnant) wife abstained from drinking. When my wife and I decided to share a dessert, our waitress visibly rolled her eyes. Few things are more insulting to a patron than being made to feel cheap by a server who won't even be bothered to keep up the pretense of good service for a low-tip-value table. 

I really can't be bothered to return to an inconsistent restaurant, and with the abundance of incredible dining experiences to be had in Madison, it may be a while before I return to Nostrano."}
{"text":"This place has been on my wife's must-go list for quite a while.  

I was expecting much more...  It was ok. 

The service was really SLOW.  I even made a point of telling the server that we were going to a show and needed to be out of the restaurant by a certain time.  We had to skip dessert due to the extremely slow service.  

The food was good but it didn't wow me.  Frankly, it felt tired.  The more inspired sounding dishes were sold out (we sat down at 6:45p - how can you be sold out of multiple entrees?!?).

Based on other reviews, perhaps we were there on an off night.  However I am not sure I can convince my wife to try it again."}
{"text":"We recently went to Nostrano for restaurant week (for dinner). I've been there twice before for lunch and the service was great and the food was amazing, so I was expecting wonderful things. I had a reservation for 4 at 8:45 on a Thursday and we got there at 8:44. After arriving, the host let us know that it would only be 2 more minutes until we sat down, and that the people at our table were just in the process of paying their bill. We sat at the bar and had a drink. 40 minutes later at 9:25, we were finally informed that our table was ready. We were all starving and I was frankly pissed. I don't understand why they couldn't have politely asked the people to leave or at least let them know another party was waiting? The restaurant staff apologized but I think it was pretty poor service that they didn't comp us our drinks or at least the olives and bread. The dinner was absolutely delicious but I was so hungry that it was hard to savor the food. Overall, not at all impressed with the service, probably the worst service I've ever had at restaurant week or at a nice restaurant in Madison. I hope they figure out a better system because I love the food."}
{"text":"After reading a few favorable reviews of Nostrano, I'm convinced they were written by friends or family of the owner.  The remodeling is very nice although there was nothing done to address the terrible acoustics in the room.  

Our appetizers were very good (Risotto w/ Pears and the Sampler platter) but rather pricey at $13-16 per. for these was too much.  From here it went down hill quickly.  My wife ordered the squash filled cannelloni.  They were rather skimpy and served on a very large plate which made them seem even smaller.  The flavor was so-so.  No salad, veggies or bread served with these either.  My entree was the Crispy Chicken Thigh for $17.  The single thigh was cooked earlier in the week and reheated before serving.  It was served with some greens on the plate - not worth the price.  Not a value at half the price.  This has to be the first Italian restaurant I've been to where there was no bread served!!!  Major disappointment.

Madison diners are spoiled with some good restaurants in the area.  Lombardino's sets the bar pretty high and Francesca's is pretty good too.  However, if Nostrano does not get it's act together and improve the entrees and how they are served, they won't be around long.

We will not return."}
{"text":"The food prepared was great, however, good food can really only go so far with such a high price tag on it. The main problem I had was how difficult it was to really understand what each food option was on the menu. We both ended up picking something off the menu and to our surprise, was nothing like we thought it'd be when it came. 

All I'm saying is that we didn't all go to culinary school and some of us struggle to make easy mac at home! So, if the menu were to explain the dishes more, instead of just listing the ingredients in the dish, I think it would help the customers expectations and would allow them to order with confidence. If that isn't the solution, then the wait staff needs to be trained to explain the dishes better. 

Again, the food was good but we spent 90$ on two drinks and two meals without really knowing what we were getting and when taking that into account as well as sub par service, I can't give more than 2 stars. 

To be honest, we'll probably not be returning but it won't be because the food wasn't good"}
{"text":"Very good food and dessert. Their gelatos are very good. I really liked the place. It was very cozy but just that its a very small place.Don't go there without a reservation."}
{"text":"Brodetto, lamb papperdelle, and sea salt caramel affogato is all you need to know. SO DELICIOUS. The brodetto and the lamb papperdelle does have a bit of a kick to it, so brace yourself for it. 

My sister, nephew and I came here for lunch and it was an awesome experience. It was quiet and empty which is ridiculous. This place should be filled to the brim with customers because the food is delicious. The waitress was really accommodating towards my 1.5 year old nephew who was in a horrible mood because we took him from the children's museum to come here."}
{"text":"Seriously Madison? We give this place 4 stars? The interior aesthetic is lovely the attitude of the employees is not. WE though that we might need a reservation but given that the place was hateful on Friday at prime dinner time that proved otherwise. This should have been the first hint that we were not in for a treat. I ordered their Old Fashioned and It was like drinking whiskey on the rocks. This is great if you like your beverages in this manner; however, I do not. Honestly, I should have sent this drink back but what the hell I dont like making a scene. The $12 charcuterie was good but they were pretty skimpy on the protein and Id have taken a cheese over the mass amount of \"homemade\" butter. Neither of the entrees were impressive. Just heavy noodles with sauce that was far too sweet. We normally get desert but it wasn't worth wasting any more time or money."}
{"text":"My food was excellent. BUT it arrived cold--all of our pastas were cold and the service was not good at all. I got the zucchini pesto tagliatele--very flavorful though. The menu is limited, pretty much just pastas. The bruschetta was great.
My bourbon cocktail was decent...but our main issue was the service. But try it for the pasta!! and the bread."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.
This place was fantastic! By far one of the best meals I have had in Madison. I went with a couple friends for restaurant week, and we were all completely blown away!
The only thing that was a little strange was my dirty martini. I learned that they don't even carry brand name alcohol like Tanqueray, so the waitress suggested a gin from Chicago which had a very unique flavor - like cardamom, and it was not really what I was expecting. But it's ok, I can look past that.
The food was SO good. To start I had a salad with picked pears and a walnut bread and my friend had the game bird terrine which was fantastic. For the entree I had the braised pancetta, a piece of pork belly served over a white bean stew with croutons. It was one of the best things I had ever eaten.... until I had dessert. The affogato was probably the best dessert I have ever eaten. Salted caramel gelato with hot espresso poured over it served with freshly fried donuts coated in salt and sugar. Amazing.
The ambiance is pretty, it feels pretty fancy and hip, more like something you would find in a city, but I liked it.
Overall our experience here was outstanding, and I would definitely return. I looked at the menu online and their restaurant week menu is quite a bargain at $35. The regularly priced items are quite expensive, so I think it's more of a special occasion restaurant. Someone mentioned it was more expensive than L'Etoile - that is false."}
{"text":"Nostrano is exactly what we needed! A small, cozy, dimly lit spot that's lively with conversation. Nostrano has a carefully thought-out menu highlighting the best of the season's ingredients, without overwhelming one with options. The farm egg salad was almost a meal on it's own. The delicata squash cannelloni was light and lovely with a crunchy roasted brussel sprout leaves. The cocktails I tried, Piper and Nehi Orange, were sweet but not too heavy - very similar style to the Velvet Hour in Chicago.  The affogato is probably the best dessert I've had in Madison in a long time. Make a reservation, it's sure to be very popular soon."}
{"text":"Cool spot right next to the Wisconsin State House, where I found myself for business. Loved the bar, which had a funny hipster vibe. Had a cocktail made from their house jam that was great. The snapper brodetto was good too. I'll go back next time I'm in Wisconsin just for the cocktails."}
{"text":"I usually don't like write a very poor review but I feel compelled this time because I have never paid so much for such bad food in my entire life.

First of all, our group of 6 was seated at a very small table along the window leaving us with no leg room.  That made it an uncomfortable experience to begin with. 

I ordered the Seafood Brodetto which comes with a Market Fish, Shellfish, Fennel & Cherry tomatoes ($24). The fish I was served which is what I was most looking forward to was about an inch and a half to 2 inches in diamater. It was by far the driest and most tasteless piece of fish I've ever eaten anywhere in my life (not an exaggeration). The mussels and sauce that they were in were again the blandest mussels I've ever eaten in my life. The meal left me 1. Stunned that a meal could be this bad 2. Hungry

My girlfriend ordered a Gnocchi dish. The gnocchi was deep fried and tasted much more like Tater Tots than any gnocchi we've ever tried. And again, the meat was way overcooked. 

I can't remember what the rest of the table ordered but only 1 person was satisfied with their meal (they ordered the Lamb Ragu).

Every person felt completely taken advantage of after the meal (Bills were $100/couple approx. with food and drink). We all also left hungry and wanting another full meal. Luckily Underground Kitchen Cooperative had a taco bar set up at Genna's next door that we happily enjoyed. 

However, it wasn't all bad. We did enjoy the decor and our server & bartender who waited on us did a good job.

I have to say that I won't ever go back especially since there are many other more affordable restaurants in town to get a much better meal.

I hope for their sake that it was just a bad night. (I will note that this dinner took place on Thursday, September 29th starting at 7 pm). After telling me experience to so many friends over and over I thought it was time to finally spend a few minutes to get this off my chest.

If you are in that area I would suggest Tornado Room, Graze, Fresco, Nat Spil & Tempest as much better options."}
{"text":"Excellent wine list and ambiance. I haven't eaten here yet, but I'm a huge fan of cozy upscale places that i can get a glass of wine and relax. This definitely fills that need. Happy to welcome them to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Thank, goodness! Finally I have found my favorite restaurant in Madison since we moved from East! The service was friendly and efficient. The atmosphere is elegant but casual. The meals we ordered - Rabbit and Pork - were fabulous with perfectly balanced sauce. Many people say the dessert here is a must. I am truly happy to have found this place - well through my colleagues' recommendations. I hope the management will keep up the great quality and passion."}
{"text":"I just read the review of the person who thought that all the favorable comments toward Nostrano were written by friends or family of the owners.  I am not a friend or a family member of the owner.  In fact, I went to Nostrano with a negative attitude not expecting much.  I was completely blown away!

I'm not sure why it's described as Italian or Mediterranean.  That's actually what completely turned me off about the concept.  I thought, \"Oh God, that's all we need... another Italian restaurant with a big bowl of pasta and lame garlic bread.\"  I am eating my words now.. along with some delicious appetizers and desserts.

As a woman, I never want to go to a restaurant and have some enormous meal that makes me want to unbutton my pants and sleep for the next 9 hours.  Hey Miranda C. who thought the portions were too small, just because you're in Wisconsin, doesn't mean you have to eat like a cow!  I go out wanting to nibble on several items (sort of like tapas style, but not necessarily Spanish every time).  I like to share with my co-diner, and eat just the right amount without feeling like I need to fast the next day.

My friend and I arrived close to 9 p.m. and only wanted an appetizer.  We ordered the charcuterie plate which was AMAZING!  The only suggestion I offered to them was that I didn't need as much of the sweet jams on the plate as they gave me, and for their own cost control, they could put less on the plate.  I could have eaten a pound of the lamb sausage.  

We had not intended on ordering dessert, but the chef convinced us to because the owners are pastry chefs and it would be a shame to pass up their specialty.  Usually since I don't have a big sweet tooth, I play it safe with dessert and order whatever chocolate dish is on the menu.  As I was scanning the list for the chocolate, a salted caramel gelato caught my eye.  It was served in a cupof espresso with house-made jam filled donuts.  Oh my God!!!  The owners truly are culinary geniuses!  Next time I go to Nostrano, I'm going to call ahead to make sure the salted caramel is on the menu.  

Even though I didn't try an entree this time, I plan to return soon, and I'm sure I'll be impressed again.  As far as the decor, it's totally adorable and cozy.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this place, including my meat and potatoes husband :)"}
{"text":"When I found out that I had to travel from Chicago to Madison for work, I immediately booked my seat at Nostrano (even before booking the hotel, to be honest). My expectations were moderately high, but they did not disappoint.  I ordered the special as a starter -- a sort of ramp and radish salad, served with tender asparagus on a bed of frisee and mayo dressing -- and it was positively delightful! The lamb ragu was equally yummy, with clearly home-made noodles in a harissa sauce.  I hadn't really saved room for dessert, but that didn't stop me from devouring my olive oil ice cream and chocolate with -- YES!! -- candied kumquat (Crema, it was named).

Also not to be missed is the Sam's Jam cocktail. It's a sloe gin base with fruit preserves, rosemary, and a twist. It's sweet (I luckily had it with dessert), but fabulous.
 
Madison has a wonderful scene, but I'll forego exploration next time and just return to what I know is great."}
{"text":"Perfect for a smoky night out. 

I would really love to stay more, but the gin dripping off the tall windows is blurring my vision of the outside world and making this all go ....very slowly. 
It's mysterious. 
It's magical.
It's an italian restaurant that lives up to your hopes and then surpasses them. 
Every dish is well in hand, and all the cocktails are spectacular. I love the lighting, the prohibition bar, the big windows, the heavy door. 
I'd recommend their version of the dark and stormy, and the lamb ragu. And dessert.

This place is an experience."}
{"text":"We ate there for lunch, whereas the prices are substantially cheaper than dinner for the same fare.
Our food was absolutely wonderful. This was one of the most enjoyable meals I have ever had in Madison and come to think of it, anywhere. The pastas were excellent and our desserts among the best I have ever had after traveling the world eating very well."}
{"text":"This was possibly the best meal I've ever had! Came here for restaurant week. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and kind. My friend has some food allergies, and our waiter was very understanding in verifying whether certain dishes contained ingredients she couldn't eat. The beer pairing was perfect. They took great care of us and we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The food was decent but definitely not worth the money.  Very limited menu and the portions were very small.  we had to wait 20 minutes for desert.  Didn't realize it took 20 minutes for cheesecake.  The coffee was cold by the time desert came out.  This is one of the worst experiences that I ever had."}
{"text":"RIP Nostrano.
Something happened. Service. Food. Drinks. Thumbs down. This used to be a great place for dinner but it seems like they intended to close, didn't, and tried to drag the last of the life out of the restaurant as long as possible. Time to put it down.

Fun tip: don't text while your guests wait for the check for 5 minutes and then ask if they need anything when you come back without the check."}
{"text":"Nostrano deserves a lot of praise. They have a simple menu which keeps them focused on just a few items. That focus pays off. The food is beyond delicious. For food in Madison this place is contender for top honors. 

Took a crowd of 11 people here they did an amazing job. I was impressed with how well it handled. Given its size that's quite the crowd for this place. Service was friendly and prompt. 

What makes this place stand out is the dessert menu. I believe at least one of the chefs was a pastry chef and you can tell. The desserts are in a league beyond the main dishes. 

Definitely a favorite spot in madison and I'll keep returning."}
{"text":"Not at all what we expected.   The staff was cold and aloof.   The cocktails were pretty good but the food was disappointing."}
{"text":"This past Friday, I had dinner reservations for 7 people at Nostrano.  I had not eaten here before but it had good reviews so I thought I'd give it a try.  Because it was Homecoming Weekend I made reservations for this large party three weeks in advance.  A few hours before my reservation time, I called to notify the restaurant that my party would be increased to 8 people.  After a prolonged period of time on hold, I was told that they had no record of my reservation and could not accommodate me.  Understand that my group of 8 came in from various parts of the country and, at this last minute, we had no other restaurant available.
     I asked to speak to the owner who told me \"Sorry. There is nothing they can do about it!\"  Obviously, someone dropped the ball on their end and it made for an awkward and unfulfilling evening.  I don't care if they have the greatest food in Wisconsin, this is no way to run a business."}
{"text":"I was definitely underwhelmed. It was less haute cusine and more haughty. I had the pork shoulder and my husband had a chicken ravioli dish. Both were veeery small portions. And by small I mean that my husband's dish was 11 bites total. No kidding, I counted. Both were in a broth that was well flavored. We were so hungry after 2 entrees and an appitizer that we went to another restaurant (Essen Haus) and had a second supper, that was much better and satifying. Let me preface all of this by saying that I have been in 5 star resturants in many countries, so I am not simply put off by food that is outside of the typical Americanized faire. This place is, to put it simply, too big for its britches. If you are an urban hipster and are looking for a scene, this is your place. If you are looking for some great food, you should pass on Nastrano."}
{"text":"Already planning my return! My birthday and anniversary have both just passed, so will have to make up a reason... But will definitely be back soon. Must. Get. Dessert. Having said that, consider sharing a salad as a starter. The roasted carrot salad with bread and cheese was well presented, farm to table fresh and flavorful. For dinner, I had pesto pasta ( coins of pasta with pressed designs ) -the grilled zucchini and baby greens on top were fresh and yummy with toasted nuts providing textural depth. Right size portion after salad and leaving room for the must have dessert. My husband was also pleased with his entree, the sausage stuffed quail. He said it was tender and delicious. ( I did not try as am a vegetarian ). 
   Dessert was a step above in both execution and quality. I loved the affogato that many others have praised, but my husband's goat's milk cheesecake was fabulous! Graham cracker cookie with creamy cheesecake, pine nut gelato, and grilled fruit added up to complex perfection.
    I ordered a drink that wasn't on the menu (amaretto sour), and unlike other diners'comments, the bartender was very accommodating and made me a great cocktail! I also ordered a ginger-based  cocktail on the waitresses' recommendation which was excellent and had special frozen juice cubes that were great and did not water down my drink... An excellent touch. My husband enjoyed his wine by the glass as a compliment to his meal. The wine list was adequate, but not extensive.
   Ambiance and service were both excellent. Our server was knowledgable and friendly and gave us fabulous recommendations. Generous and descriptive but not at all condescending. She truly wanted us to enjoy our meal. Our water was refilled immediately when getting low at least four times ( I was thirsty).
    I will be back as soon as possible. Perhaps next payday. A superb, romantic date with my husband where everything was as amazing as my date!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this restaurant so bad.  Rated highly as currently one of \"Madison's Bests\" and in the location of Peppino's (our first 'real' date spot from way back and such a charming little Italian spot), I had high hopes.  Back in town for a college friend's wedding, my husband and I made reservations for a Friday evening at 7:30pm.  We arrived at about 7:25 only to be told that our table wasn't ready.  Bar was full and since we had just come from a pre-dinner-drink at Genna's, we weren't gung-ho on the hostess's suggestion to go there and wait for them to call.  So we decided to wait outside...how long could it be, right? We had reservations after all.  While the hostess occasionally kept us updated, we sat on the sweltering curb until AFTER 8pm for our \"reserved\" 7:30 table!  WHAT. And recall:  record temps of over 100 degrees.  Woof.  I don't usually expect handouts, but for this atrocity, at least comp us a drink or dessert, no?

We shared the scallops as a first course.  I had the snapper bordetto and my husband the lamb pappardelle.  While all \"good\", I felt the price for the portion size and quality of preparedness (fish overdone), was a bit steep.  And the service was slow as molasses.  Our waitress was new (that's the only logistical explanation that makes sense) and didn't seem to have a lot of knowledge regarding the menu or suggestions.  The bartender had to refill our water glasses because she was MIA.  We contemplated dessert, but it took about 10 minutes for her to bring over the dessert menu and then about another 10 for her to check back to see if we were interested.  Hence, we balked.  

If (and that's a big if,) I returned, I would sit at the bar.  Cocktail menu looked very promising!  But overall, I think poor Peppino is rolling in his grave."}
{"text":"Similar menu to 43 North. Small portions but well thought out. Mixed drinks are served like martini. Killer atmosphere. Not cheap."}
{"text":"Overwhelmingly disappointing experience tonight (May 22, 2015). Prior 5-6 experiences have been good to excellent but tonight we were left shocked by the precipitous deterioration in food quality and marginal level of service. What is more is that we gave the server and business owners ample opportunity to correct the situation. 

Cocktails and olive plate were acceptable. From there things fell apart. Our server periodically disappeared and was not interested in correcting problems that developed. 

I ordered the celery root soup. The soup was both cold and while not offensive in taste- it lacked any meaningful flavor other than that of celery root. The seafood in the soup was rubbery and tasteless. After two bites, I informed our server that the soup did not meet my expectations and it was sent back to the kitchen. We were not charged- fair enough- but there was only a lackluster apology and no effort to rectify the situation was made. 

I requested one of the pastas on the menu at this point- the orecchiette. The pasta was mushy and covered with a bland cheese and mint. I'm not sure what the mint was doing there- but the flavors were uninspired. I opted to fill up on bread to make the best of a disappointing evening. I informed our server again that the now more expensive alternative dish was equally disappointing. 

The soup did not appear on the bill but the pasta did appear on the bill even though I gave up after 2-3 bites. I made a 20% tip (since my primary concern was food quality- although the server made minimal effort to improve matters) and wrote on the top of my credit card authorization: \"Please call regarding bill and food quality concerns.\"

I had thought the fair thing to do would be to address the matters directly with the business owners before broadcasting my concerns with friends and family. Unfortunately, the prompt phone call I received after leaving Nostrano accused me of not paying my bill and then mid-way through the phone message explained that my credit card authorization had magically re-appeared and oh by the way- I see that you had some concerns with your meal. Ironically- my phone number that they were calling me on was written on the credit authorization with the 20% tip. 

There are some serious issues going on at this place and I'm very sad to see how they chose to handle a situation that might have been rectified with even a marginal level of concern. 

I can't recommend this restaurant to anyone hoping for an enjoyable evening unless you enjoy bland food at a high price."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here.  We are only visiting for the weekend so we wanted to save our 'nice' meals for dinners and try something local we don't have in our area.  Our first hint should have been a lack of other customers on a Friday night.  We called to see if we needed reservations and where told that we didn't need reservations for 5pm dinner.  They asked if we had reservations when we got there although I don't know why, the restaurant was empty and never did fill up even an hour and a half later when we finally left.  Although they where completely empty the hostess sat us right next to the front door with only a small curtain separating us from the door.  When we asked to move they seemed less than enthusiastic.  After getting settled in again and looking over the menu (which isn't very clear where the appetizers ended and the main courses start the waitress came over and let us know that they are out of one of the fish options.  They have such a limited menu, that excluded 25% of the main courses.  I'm allergic to shellfish so that left me with only 2 options neither of which appealed to me.  (rabbit and quail)  The should mention the menu states omissions or change requests will be politely declined and to let the server know of food allergies.  When my husband ordered the seafood soup, I mentioned to the waitress that I was allergic to shellfish and she said 'there's not much in it' so it shouldn't be a problem.  I was shocked but shrugged it off as I wasn't planning on trying his soup but a few of the other menu items had shellfish in them and remember: no menu changes allowed!  We ended up ordering 3 'sides' besides the soup because there was not nearly enough of anything to be considered a meal.  For the amount they charge and pasta being relatively cheap, they could have done much better in this area.  For desert we ordered the goats milk cheesecake and cappuccinos.  I watched as the waitress made the cappuccinos with drip coffee (although she did steam the milk).  They did include an utterly delicious amaretto cookie on the side.  Made in house and left me wanting more unfortunately they don't sell them separately.  The cheesecake didn't come out for 20 minutes.  We asked the waitress about it after about 10 minutes and she said it was coming so we tried to be patient and sip the coffees so that we would have some left with desert.  By the time the desert came out we had her box it up because the coffee was already cold.  She offered to refill the coffee but by then we just wanted to get back to the hotel.  For the price, this was not somewhere we will try again."}
{"text":"Food was well done and well presented.  The grilled octopus was cooked just right. And the main dishes and dessert were quite good.  On the pricy end but was good for taking my wife there for her birthday dinner and a special evening."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!  I'm so happy there's an option like this in Madison.  The owners are apparently from Chicago & I could picture the restaurant fitting in perfectly in Lincoln Park or Bucktown.  Ambiance, service, food & drinks are all top-notch. Proud, unpretentious & deliberate ingredient pairings.  Definitely try a few staples from the appetizer list: marinated olives & Yellowtail Crudo. Delish!"}
{"text":"I came here during a work trip that happened to fall on restaurant week, which in my hometown tends to mean smaller portions and lower quality.  Not at Nostrano, although I admit I've never been here before this. The cauliflower soup with mushrooms had a delightful smoky undertone, the ragu was spiced perfectly and delicately with cinnamon and pepper that complemented the shredded meat of the lamb, and the finale of affogato made for a perfect but not too filling end to the meal. I did a wine pairing that ended with some of the finest moscato I've ever enjoyed. The staff was knowledgable and helpful. I did ask the server if the pasta was homemade, to which she responded the ragu was not; for restaurant week they used ragu instead of
their homemade pappardelle. It hardly detracted from the meal though. A wonderful experience overall, the only comparable experiences I've had happened in the hills of Tuscany."}
{"text":"I'm a fan because we had awesome service. The pate was allegedly \"legendary\" - I don't eat meat. Which is why I wish I could give 3.5 stars. It worked really well for meat eaters (my family) and only OK for me. 

Scallops were well cooked but plate was a mess, salad of garden greens and beets were fine but nothing special. I felt a little left out - especially after I tasted the grapes on my daughters lamb dish - man, did those pack a cool, interesting punch that felt - WOW. All the rest (again, limited cause I'm not a meat eater) tasted fine. 

Slow food, local focus is awesome, staff was perfect, seating in big booth was uncomfortable (too stiff backed), wine suggested was great, but it's pricey for not feeling delighted. Perhaps the meat eaters did -  my son who ate quail for the first time said \"I'd eat this anytime over steak.\" So if you are a meat eater consider that - but this is Madison and there's enough mixed marriages here where a stellar seafood or veggie dish is called for beyond pasta and cherry tomatoes, I can make that at home."}
{"text":"What can i say? The food was awesome!!!
So delicate and flavors well matched. Yet I can't give it five stars. 

I would call nostrano American Italian fusion. The food is rather expensive though, even for a small eater like me, who usually eats half my portion, I was still hungry..

Anyhow the desserts here are out of this world!!!! Very very good. 

Bar is alright, not a fan of the cocktails. 

The place is rather tiny and it's popular. So go ahead and make a reservation on opentable! It's better safe than sorry."}
{"text":"I must start this review by noting that it is ever so slightly bizarre that they keep their door locked even a few minutes after opening hour. We had a reservation for a little bit after their opening hour, but we had to knock and wait a minute before we were actually allowed in. Not a huge turnoff, but it made for an awkward start as we stood there for a while wondering if we had the wrong location.

Nostrano has a really nice, earthy/all-natural kind of ambience that isn't repeatedly shoved in your face like in some other places (OK, we GET it, it's \"farm-to-fork\", like basically any other respectable expensive restaurant). It felt comfortable and classy, but not overwhelming.

Our server was everything you'd want in an upscale restaurant (except for servers who might bring extra free food!)--attentive but not too overbearing, extremely kind, knowledgeable, and overall pleasant to be around.

We started off the meal with a salami appetizer that was sort of just an explosive amalgam of very different flavors. I can't remember for the life of me which ones were which, but some of the salami was pretty classic (still better than high-quality store-bought stuff), and some of the salami had no resemblance to anything I had tasted before in my life. Some of the pickled vegetables on the plate were odd, but some were quite good. Was it an interesting experience for my palette? Yes. Would I get it again? For $21? Absolutely not.

For the main course, I got their sausage-stuffed roasted quail with broccolini while my girlfriend opted for the goat cheese risotto. She loved her risotto with the small critique that she wished it had a bit more goat cheese. Personally, this being my risotto devirginization (how can I be a foodie without having ever eaten risotto??), I found it perfectly creamy and richly flavored.

The quail was decent, but I don't think I would get it again. For one, it was $26 for a very small quail. In comparison to the game hen at 43 North, this was smaller, not as tasty, and more expensive. Additionally, the sausage stuffing was good/okay, but detracted a bit texturally from the quail. I'm not sure I particularly enjoyed having in one bite both the stringy, delicate quail and the meaty, ground pork consistency sausage--there have got to be better flavor combinations out there. Finally, for me the main redeeming factor for poultry is the crispy, fatty skin, which this quail unfortunately lacked. So it was still good, just not a stellar dish that I would pay $26 at an upscale restaurant for.

I must say that the dessert was incredible, especially the affogato dessert. It was pretty simple-looking (basically donuts dipped in expresso and some caramel gelato), but somehow everything comes together in a gooey foodgasm of cold, warm, creamy, and soft textures. I am  honestly not a dessert person at all, but I feel like I absolutely HAVE to try this at home.

Overall, I think the experience was a bit overpriced for what it was, but still quite tasty. I would've given 3.5 stars if given the ability to, but I rounded up to 4. The dessert, service, risotto, and ambience were all very nice. I would definitely come again if given the opportunity to splurge and try something else, like the pasta."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night (the online reservation system was very useful) and had the Olive appetizer (which was worth the 5 dollars just for the amazing homemade sourdough bread that comes with it), the spicy chicken and the whitefish. Everything is carefully thought out, balanced, and with excellent quality ingredients (same goes for the cocktails - we had the sazerac and rhubarb3). Would definitely be interested in going again in the winter and seeing how their menu changes with the season."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Loved the cocktails - old fashioned & martinez - and the entrees & dessert (basque cake) were great. Not a huge fan of the potted turkey appetizer but it was interesting. 

More of a modern foodie place than a classic Italian.

We'll go back."}
{"text":"On a first visit on a Thursday night around 7:45 I and my companion were quickly seated. The bartender very helpful in explaining the various excellent signature drinks which were both very delicious. The ambience is very nice and quiet. We were disappointed that the entree we each wanted was out. We ordered two different  entrees 2 share one of the lamb sausage with pasta and the other short rib pasta dish. Nothing extraordinary heavy on the pasta light on the meat. First had the appetizer bruschetta and that was excellent. I would recommend for appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"Despite that they made me stand there and wait to conform a table for one for a while (don't people go to restaurant alone in Madison?), I like this place. A wedge of a building with an entrance on one corner seems to create unique layout with a slightly cramped bar area.
The service was lovely, a tall lovely waitress and a low table is always a good combination for the patrons. ;)
Great food, all nicely prepared. I got the seafood Brocetto, lovely! The butter lettuce salad was almost there, saved by the candied olives. Dessert, a creamy  creamy mush of gellato and expresso and a handful of bomboloni to dipped in was outreagous!!!"}
{"text":"Is this the best new restaurant in Madison? Based on previous reviews, it may depend on your luck with the waitstaff. The food quality certainly puts it in the upper tier of recent attempts at locally grown fare, as Madison tries to out-Portland Portland in the area of \"sustainable regionalism\". Nostrano may bill itself as Italian, but don't expect heaping plates of pasta; the vibe here is more rustic . . . peasant food for the \"think green\" set.

My wife and I dined here before an Overture Center event. When we made that clear to our very cordial waitress, she made sure our dessert and check arrived in a timely manner . . . kudos there. They've redone the decor from the old Peppino's digs; lots of earth tones to complement the organic feel of the food. The new bar area is very nice.  Started with the sea scallops; quite good, but we've had better scallops in Madison (particularly at Eno Vino). The highlight of this dish was actually the smoked oxtail that accompanied the scallops. . . delicious! My entree was the Pork Shoulder Agrodolce, as tender a piece of meat you could want, served with a cannellini sweet-and-sour broth. Difficult to find any fault here; the level of kale was perfect (unlike a recent experience at L'Etoille). My wife had the parpardelle with lamb ragu . . . interestingly, she had the exact same dish at a Portland restaurant called Clyde Common. This was comparable in taste and texture, which is saying a lot, as CC is considered one of Portland's best. Dessert was a cocoa torta with coffee mousse and a coconut gelato. I was pleased to find this only mildly sweet, in the European tradition, as opposed to the sugar-saturated fare you usually get at American restaurants.

This all added up to a very satisfying meal, and while the menu is limited, it was a good enough experience to bring us back (I'm interested in trying the short ribs and the sturgeon). It's a small place, and was only moderately busy for a Friday night. Furthermore, the exterior is very plain and not terribly inviting. I hope Madison discovers this place and keeps it around a while."}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I came here for a drink on St. Patrick's Day on a whim and loved the place.  Our bartender was friendly, helpful, and a very good mixologist.  He made a delicious interpretation of a gin press that made me regret my Hopalicious!  I'd like to come back some time for a full meal."}
{"text":"After hearing about their migration from Chicago, my mother and I dined there about a year ago and view it as one of Madison's best. They strive to support the local economy and farmers visible through their very seasonal menus. 

Each area of the restaurant is represented by experts who know how to bring the ingredients to their fullest potentials. Dinner is a must but also check out their amazing lunch specials and coming soon, BRUNCH!!"}
{"text":"Came in at the last minute for restaurant week. So glad we did. Yet another outstanding meal and excellent wine pairing. Discovered Monkey 47, a German dry gin in the London style that is quite impressive. And the risotto with carrot and Brussels sprouts was creamy and smooth without being heavy. An honor to come in tonight."}
{"text":"When I happened across an article of top chefs and Tim Dahl popped up in Madison I couldn't resist going to his restaurant. Of course, that would mean I would have to be in Madison and it just so happened I was going there for work.

The place did not disappoint. It definitely had a Chicago feel with the exposed brick and just a simple and minimal interior yet not at all pretentious. I liked the feel of the dining area and the waitress not only put us at ease but she also knew everything and then some when it came to the menu.

I couldn't decide on the entree so the waitress helped with the tie breaker. I went with the braised pancetta, or pork belly. It was the heavier of the options but I was fascinated with the dish and wanted to try it. It was nicely complemented with the potenta, and the other sides such as hazelnuts and grapes. It was simply fantastic and disappeared as quickly as it appeared.

We actually started the dinner with the olives and also the scallops. Both were very good... the scallops came with artichokes so that was a nice surprise (I didn't order it or read up on it). The drink I went with was homemade jam with gin and some other stuff. It doesn't really matter because it was one of the best concoctions I could remember. It had champaign so it had a little fizz but it was also tart, which is completely my style.

i finished up with the Affogato, which is basically 3 little donuts next to a cup of caramel gelato melting in expresso. You dip the donuts in there if you like but they were just great on their own! The combo sounded a little strange but it worked, which, knowing the history of the chefs, you would completely expect!!

Without a doubt, if you have a chance to come, even if it's just for a drink and dessert, then do it!"}
{"text":"Usually I take a few days before writing a review, but I feel particularly hyperbolic after what just happened. Is this what true love feels like? 

Day to day I am superbly cost conscious but at Nostrano I indulged in opulence and felt neither guilt nor regret. Order an appetizer. Order a drink. Order a main, and definitely order dessert. Everything is good. What is the word for something that is both surprising and familiar? Nostrano does this really well. 

I had the orecchiette with fennel sausage, brussel sprouts, parsnips, and a sauce that came from heaven. Every bite was like seeing through space and time. 

The espresso is transcendental -  it comes with a surprise dessert pairing.  Was it a dark chocolate covered espresso bean? A crispy pizzelle?? No!!! It was a piece of pear jelly rolled in sour sugar, and it was mouth-watering, palette-cleansing, and like nibbling on a grownup fruit roll-up.  

They have so many types of gin, gin that tastes like flowers, gin that tastes like plums. For the appetizer, the salumi board, there were two types of liver. I ate everything, and I hate liver.

Now that I've sufficiently hyped this place up, forget everything I just said and go see what it's like for yourself already."}
{"text":"Menu is very limited, to the rare extent that I had trouble finding something I wanted. The dish I eventually did pick out (mushroom pasta) was pretty excellent; it seems pretty apparent that they're making their own pasta in-house. I can't think of another place anywhere where you'll find the ingredients actually infused into the pasta. They also have a very good understanding of the meaning of the phrase \"al dente.\" 1 minute less and it would have been undercooked, 1 minute more and it wouldn't have been al dente anymore. Keep in mind that the portions are pretty small.

However, the service was extremely rude and uninviting. The waitress made more than a couple snarky remarks for absolutely no reason, to the point that I was about ready to make a scene about it. Interesting fact about this place - you can buy a six-pack for the kitchen staff. Felt like a pretty good use of money that otherwise would have went into the tip."}
{"text":"8/24/13 My wife and I celebrated our 14th anniversary by having dinner at Nostrano.  We agreed their meat board was the best we have ever had.  The salad was fresh.  The lamb pasta was flavorful.  The gelato dessert was tasty.  The service was professional, warm, and welcoming.  Their wine steward was our server and she helped pair a nice wine with each course.  My wife and I disagreed on what the Yelp rating should be.  She said 5.  I said 4.  I wish the pasta had contained more lamb.  The coffee was okay."}
{"text":"We visited Nostrano on a recent Friday night. I don't understand why this place doesn't have a line waiting at the door. It was fantastic!

We were seated promptly. The decor is clean, comfortable, and tasteful. There was a beautiful bottle display we admired from across the room. Our server was fun, knowledgeable, and seemed to really enjoy her job.

I started with the Jackman Punch which was not only delicious but fun to look at. It included bright red ice-cubes made with hibiscus tea. For an appetizer we went with the sourdough rye which was a delicious chewy loaf of sourdough bread. Perfectly crisp crust with a chewy middle. It was served with venison salami, pears, and chicory greens. I would definitely order this again. My entree was the quail which was stuffed with sausage. It included large navy beans, broccoli and salsa verde. Everything was perfectly cooked. Not just the flavors, but textures and temperatures were all spot on.

I really struggle to determine why this place was not packed. There's a ramp to park which is only a block away. It is on the pricey side but well worth it. The entire experience was just about perfect."}
{"text":"Had white fish sandwich for lunch. Yelp said it wasn't open but it was. Decent price. Had branzino instead of the white fish on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. The chef changes the menu based on seasonal ingredient availability. Cocktails were interesting and seasonally relevant. Highly recommend the bruschetta and the pork dish. Don't forget dessert it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice while visiting, both have been delicious and delightful. Attentive service with very interesting design elements-lots of cool repurposed industrial or farm equipment. Food is inventive with generous portions.  There are options for all tastes with lovely presentation. The bourbon collection is EXTRAORDINARY. 10, 12, 20 Van Winkle available, for example, with many other rare, high end bottles.  Absolutely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I thorougly enjoyed dinner last evening at Nostrano. I am already planning another trip to Madison and dinner in this restuarant. From the time that I walked in the door, and greeted by Lisa with a warm welcome, unitl the time I departed I felt the hospitality. The food was excellent! I enjoyed the Little Gem Salad (it was little, but dynamic and flavorful), the Grilled Sturgeon made me want to go back into the kitchen and slap somebody. (Where I'm from that means it was delicious.) Ha, ha, ha! Of course, I was not about to leave without trying a desert, since they are known for their deserts, so I toped my experience off with the Copetta: the fusion of the blackberries, butterscotch, basil and smoked hickeroy nuts blended with polento budino and and coconut gelato and all I could say was, Amen! Thanks, Lisa, et al for making my visit crave for more."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews and hearing good things about Nostrano, we were expecting a little more than we got. 

We started off with drinks - a Cognac Old Fashioned and a Variable High Cloudiness and Gusty Winds (fancy dark and stormy). The drinks were actually topnotch, although not as large as I expected - this turned out to be fine because they were to be savored. 

We ordered the Dunbarton Blue appetizer to share, and it was also good. The cheese was the highlight of the plate, but everything else paired well too. 

For the main course, my girlfriend ordered the Beef Shortribs, and I ordered the Grilled Sturgeon. We were not impressed by the portion size or either dish, although the presentation was very nice. My sturgeon must have been waiting on the shortribs to finish cooking because they came out nice and hot, but the sturgeon was just barely warm by the time I took a bite. In regard to taste, the spareribs were excellent, and the gnocchi that accompanied them were prepared well also. I was not delighted by the sturgeon, and though I am not an expert on how to prepare this fish, I think it may have been undercooked (it was a little pink, and juicy in the center). Also, I didn't enjoy the crunchy chick peas very well, although I have never really enjoyed chick peas in any form. 

Because we were still hungry, for dessert, we split the Sorbetto - the presentation was nice, but there are probably other desserts on the menu that would top this one (we ordered it only because my girlfriend has an egg allergy, and it was the only egg-free dessert option). I also ordered a cognac to top off the evening. I was still hungry, but I felt a little bit better about it after the cognac. 

Both the atmosphere and waitstaff were pleasant enough. All told, the bill came to $85 plus 20% tip = $102. We both agreed that for this price, we would not be back soon."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Madison. Great atmosphere, food, and drinks. A little bit pricier than other similar options along the Square, but it's worth it! You can't go wrong with any of their pastas, especially the lamb ragu. Large plates are just as good and be sure to leave room for dessert. They're all plated beautifully and are complex and flavourful."}
{"text":"Nostrano is our favorite restaurant in Madison. The sformato and quail were among the best things we have eaten in town. Brodetto and rabbit boudin blanc have also been good, but the smoked lentils beneath the quail should not be missed. For cocktails, we trusted our server's recommendation and had three glorious Fistfuls of Dollars. Impeccable service. Very quiet on a Tuesday night, with a beautiful view of the capitol."}
{"text":"The wine list is fabulous! We shared the duck pappardelle as an entree because a peek at the dessert list made us know that we would be having dessert. The duck was delicious and the homemade whole wheat pasta did not disappoint. Flavors were perfect.  We shared the affagato (doughnuts, expresso and caramel gelato) and the chocolate ganache; both dishes were highlighted with homemade sorbets. Dessert was so outstanding that we walked back in sub zero temperatures the next night to try 2 more desserts.

{"text":"I was in Madison for Business and took my team (5 total) to Nostrano.  Menu is definitely new but being a foodie, I enjoyed it.

My dinner started off with a Manhattan.  The bartender made it perfectly!  We skipped appetizers and moved to the main course where I ordered the Rabbit Gnocchi.  This dish was amazing, presentation 5 stars, flavor and taste 5 stars, and everything was prepared perfectly.  Entree 5 Stars

I skipped dessert and chose to order a glass of Port.  The team ordered dessert and from where I was sitting, I was jealous.  Dessert looked great and everyone devoured them, leaving me with not even a taste.  

One additional comment, between a Manhattan before dinner, a glass of Pinot Noir with dinner and Port after dinner.  Drinks were priced perfectly, not expensive at all and definitely worth it!

Overall, I will go back every time I am in Madison and I will recommend this place."}
{"text":"Might be the best food in Madison that is not a burger, brat, pizza or falafel sandwich. Great cocktails,amazing foodie-lovers Italian eats. Call ahead, the place is small--like just a little bigger than Cleveland's Lunch small."}
{"text":"Truly a fine dining experience here every visit. Madison is fortunate to have such a lovely restaurant.

Locally sourced ingredients, and a nice balance of interesting dishes that include rarity items like wild game sausage. I love that they make every dish a unique blend of ingredients.

Really, though, don't we all visit here for the desserts? I've read the chefs are married and the better half of this dynamic duo is baking her amazing creations downstairs while he runs the main kitchen, which you can catch glimpses of from the bar.

I have but one complaint, which is they do not have decaf espresso. I realize this is an oxymoron for many who may read this review, but there is a famous dessert with caramel gelato, swimming in espresso, in which I would love to indulge, but the caffeine would put me over the edge. My server says many patrons request decaf. It is unfortunate they cannot oblige.

Oh, and we also visit for the clever craft cocktails and creative mixologists.

A recent visit during Madison Restaurant Week, winter 2015, proved to be a lovely way to spend part of a dreary afternoon enjoying a 3-course, perfectly portioned lunch, for only $15.

Finally, I will mention some folks will find the menu a bit intimidating. I admit I usually Google at least one listed ingredient during each visit. I suggest jumping into the menu with both feet. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nostrano was very accommodating to give us a last minute table for two at 9 on new year's eve. I tried the \"our word\" cocktail, which was strong and tasted like flowers soaked in gin (though not at all in a bad way), and ordered the bison carpaccio and the roasted quail. Both dishes were really yummy. My bf got the scallops and the braised pancetta. I don't really go for seafood so I was not jealous of his starter, but I knew I'd made a mistake letting him get the pancetta for the main course instead of me...it was absolutely delicious. My food was good, but his was better.  We both had dessert, me with some fancy donuts and salted caramel/espresso gelato, and he the pumpkin tiramisu. Our wine with dinner was a yummy syrah recommended by our waitress. Basically, it was a great meal, especially considering how impromptu it was.

My only complaint was that I did not find either the cocktail, entree, or dessert menus to be as well-rounded as I expected.  I felt like each could have used one or two more options.  There was nothing beefy, for example, to order as a main course, and nothing lemony for desert. That made me try some new things, but kept me from being able to balls to the wall bliss out on my dining experience.  I'd like to go back and see what they have in future seasons---maybe their menu changes?

A note abt service: it is SO awesome to have a waitress who is really competent but chilled out. She also had the world's most adorable name...Cricket!!"}
{"text":"The people here are all very welcoming and nice. The host was awesome! 
Things slowed waaay down once we were seated. Took forever to even order, even though it wasn't busy. We sat for a long time with empty water and cocktail glasses even after we asked for refills.
The food was ok. My orecchiette had a strong cinnamon or nutmeg flavor which was sort of off-putting. Husband really enjoyed his short rib rigatoni. All-in-all probably wouldn't come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Food: 5 stars.  Very creative and sophisticated cuisine.  The Brodetto was probably the best I've ever had.  My wife had orrechiette with a wonderful homemade sausage and brussels sprouts.  Wonderful as well.

Ambiance: 4 stars.  Nice, but more like a hipster bistro.  It just didn't match the food. Easily overlooked.

So why 3 stars?  $$$$$$$$$$$  $9 for a dessert?  $23 for a bowl of pasta?  I mean, yeah...REALLY good food, but this would have been a $70 dinner in New York City and it was over $100.  Great food, but the value just isn't there.  As a result I probably won't go back.  L'Etoile and Harvest are right around the corner, just as good and cheaper.

I never thought I would say L'Etoile was cheaper than anything."}
{"text":"We were out progressive dinner/bar hopping, with craft cocktails a prerequisite, and Nostrano was one of our stops. Our cocktails were excellent, they are very serious about their craft cocktails with top notch ingredients whether you choose a classic or something more creative. The menu was interesting, and the execution was excellent, so we ended up doing two courses at Nostrano instead of just the one we'd planned. We sat at the counter by choice so we interacted with several servers and the bartender, all great. We expected Merchant down the street to be great and it definitely is/was, but we liked Nostrano even more. Merchant is more (noisy, dark) craft cocktail bar with good food, Nostrano is more top notch casual restaurant with craft cocktails. Both wonderful!"}
{"text":"I dined here with my date during Restaurant Week. We were extremely pleased with the food taste and presentation and pleasantly surprised by the portion sizes, which were generous. The menu is refreshingly different with tasty twists like candied olives on a salad or taboulleh made with farro. Decor and service are also very nice-a lovely place for a special dinner.

The menu changes, but we ordered (and loved):

Marinated Olives

Little Gem Salad
Farro Tabbouleh

Smoked Pork Crepinettes
Orecchiette (with spicy chicken sausage)

Lemon Ricotta Cake
Baked Chocolate Ganache"}
{"text":"\"The people of Madison shall make a pilgrimage to the great restaurant, and bring their famine and strife to the wooden tables. But the cooks shall vanquish the hunger of the masses and the cups will runneth over with exquisite craft cocktails until all forget their misfortunes of days past.\" - Nostra[no]damus

So it is written, and Nostrano is the consummation of the prophecies of old. 

\"...their nostrils will be filled with the fragrance of savory snapper brodetto and grilled guinea hen. The braised pancetta will melt upon their tongues and the desserts of ganache and affogato will delight their palates.\""}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and pacing, but the food just didn't measure up.  The menu has so much potential, but the food was just not \"knock your socks off\" which is what you'd expect at those prices.  We had the white gazpacho, salumi platter, rabbit and orecchiette.  Besides the over salted sausage in the orecchiette, none of the food was memorable.  I'll definitely give them another shot considering the atmosphere and pacing are perfect for a lingering dinner with good company."}
{"text":"Yes, as good as it gets. I regret not writing a review way earlier when I dined here in April. Bad Jesse bad Jesse. I'll start with the space. The layout of the restaurant is super cool. When you walk in the bar (which looks like a bar that I used to belly up to in East Village) is right by the door so you don't immediately have to stand face to face with a hostess or host upon entering. I like that! Not that there is anything wrong with being greeted by a host or hostess upon entering a resturant. Nastrano's layout is just unique. What also unique is the wine and spirit selection. The carefully selected wines and hand crafted cocktails really brought the whole bar program to the next level for Madison. Whoever selects the wines definitely knows what they are doing. I love a notable selection of boutique wines and bubbles without the pretentious or stuffiness.  The server made incredible recommendations to my partner. \"if you like a sauvignon blanc try this Italian white\" \"This red blend drinks like a super tuscan and will pair well with seafood if you choose seafood for dinner\". Also we had negronis made right. Equal parts sweet vermouth, campari, and gin.The quality of the bar ingredients were top notch and also carefully selected. Ok now for the food. The menu may seem a little intimidating for the average foodie but there was nothing intimidating about the knowledge and helpfulness from our server. Marinated olives were better than the olives I had in Sicily. Like others have written, the plating of dishes are as beautiful on the eyes as they are on the taste buds. We had the quail dish. Nice crisp skin and incredibly moist meat. Just the right amount of salt. The snapper dish was a home run too. I literally wanted to pick up the bowl and drink the brother that the snapper and squid where in. I didn't though. Instead, i sopped up that deliciousness with the grilled bread. Now on to dessert. This was the point of Nirvana at Nastrano. Sea salt and caramel gelato. Enough said. don't ask just try it and then order a second one. Trust me you will thank me for it."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently ate here, and while it wasn't an unpleasant experience, for the money I'd rather dine at Eno Vino. The cocktail menu lacked anything light and fruity but they did accommodate my request. Our server was polite, but she made little attempt to explain the esoteric and limited menu even though we told her it was our first visit to Nostrano. She also made little attempt to bring our drinks promptly. As a former server-now foodie, this is a huge no-no. I actually enjoy the anticipation of waiting for a well-prepared meal, but I expect to be offered a drink the first time a server visits my table, not wait ten minutes after her second visit. The menu has few vegetarian options, and if I wanted a salad I can make a magnificent one at home for about 1/8th the price.

Hubs had the risotto, while I had the seafood brodecco. The portion size was perfect and the flavors were amazing. My tastebuds were dazzled, and I sampled his risotto-which is what I will order if we do end up going again. Our server didn't bring our new drinks out until halfway through the meal. Perhaps she was new, or having an 'off' night? The place didn't seem so large that the bartender could have been that backed up. On the plus side, our drinks lasted us through dessert, which was a chocolate torte with gellato. Made from sheep's milk, it was slightly salty, but I thought this only added to the flavor.

I would have given more stars if there were more options for those of us who prefer not to eat mammals. I also would have appreciated more welcoming hospitality as opposed to the indifference we encountered."}
{"text":"We've lived in Madison for 44 years. We have regular feedback from a former chef and frequenter of restaurants. I think this was one of the best meals we have ever had. We had sturgeon and quail. One of us marveled over the butter crisp lettuce appetizer while she shared our entres. A delightful birthday meal."}
{"text":"When I visited Nostrano the first time, years ago, I was not only impressed with the food but with the service as well. The food was delicious and our server had a vast knowledge of both the food and alcohol they served. They were very attentive and I was eager to visit again. If I was writing this review at that time, I would have given 5 out of 5 stars. 

Unfortunately over the years the quality of service has slowly declined. The staff isn't as knowledgeable nor as attentive. Our most recent visit to Nostrano today was extremely disappointing. It's Restaurant Week so I give restaurants a little slack on food quality and service. It's a crazy busy time so I imagine it is a stressful experience for the staff. However, when we arrived for our lunch reservations (a party of 4), only about 25% of the tables were occupied. It was pretty slow. We placed our orders right away, with my husband asking for his dessert to be boxed right up front, and the first course was delivered quickly. Our second course came about 20 minutes after our initial dishes were cleared away. A little long, but again, restaurant week, I'll let it slide. 

Our server was not super attentive to our table but our drink glasses were kept full by other staff members as they went by the table. Midway through our main course we advised our server that we were on a tight timeline and would need dessert and our bill soon. 30 minutes after the main course we still didn't have either and half our party had to leave to get back to work on time. The server refused to pack the dessert to go, even though that had been an initial request for one of the meals. The excuse was that the dessert wouldn't keep well; however, it surprises me that Nostrano wouldn't be prepared to send desserts home with their guests. Isn't that an age old tradition? Taking your dessert to go?

Anyway, another twenty or so minutes later, still no dessert while the table behind us that came in during our main course is well into their own desserts. I had already left and by that time my husband had had enough. He expressed his dissatisfaction and left (even though we ended up paying for the full meal). 

Nostrano has always been the place we go when we get a date night. I'm sure we'll be back, but it won't be our first choice anymore."}
{"text":"Probably shouldn't review this place because I want it all to myself! 

My BF and I made a reservation for 9:30- but we got hungry early and showed up at about 8:45 and they were very accommodating and even got us a table outside.  We started out the meal with the scallop appetizer.  The scallops were melt in your mouth delicious and it came with wonderfully smokey oxtail on the side. 

I ordered the squab which came with red cabbage and spatzli and my not-so-inner food nerd was totally thrilled because- 

1) Never had squab before and it was delicious! I expected it to have a more poultry-ish taste/texture but it definitely didn't.  Don't even know how to describe it other than yummy!
2) This dish reminded me of German food (which I love) but in a Northern Italy kind of way (Italy borders Austria after all).  So cool to see  different side of Italian food.  

My boyfriend had the tri-tip.  He loved his meal- I was too focused on my own to pay attention to what he was saying about his.  

The portions were perfect- we had just enough room to split a dessert. Can't remember the official name of it but it was a toffee pudding with gelato and bananas on top.  The BF and I  had a memorable experience with toffee pudding at another restaurant and this was just as good (dare I say better?) than the dessert that got us excited for toffee pudding in the first place. 

To say our server - Greg I think- is knowledgable about the food is a total understatement.  You can tell he knows and loves each dish.  He was just as excited for me to try squab for the first time as I was.  And I was pretty dang excited.  :D

Nostrano is a must try!!"}
{"text":"I came here last week for lunch during restaurant week and all I have to say is that the service and wait time on every single course was ridiculously long. I came with a friend who is moving soon, so this was supposed to be a nice going away lunch. Not the case. 

I understand restaurant week is a crazy time (I work in the food industry), but each course took around 30-45 minutes. We spent over 2 hours in Nostrano total, and we even arrived around 1:15. 

Our server was sweet, but had zero sense of urgency. I asked if we could have our desserts ordered right when our entrees came and she said that everything is coming out as soon as possible. Umm okay? I also asked if we could have our check right away so we will be ready to go when our desserts come. Like the rest of our meal, the desserts took another half hour and we still had not received our check. When we finished our desserts we had to wait another solid 5 minutes while our server was standing by the bar doing absolutely nothing. And again, we had to wait another 5 minutes for the server to pick up our cards to pay for our lunch. 

The worst part was that the restaurant was not very busy at all.

Overall, the food was good, but the service and wait time of this restaurant was SO disappointing. Since this experience I'm not sure if I'll be visiting Nostrano anytime soon."}
{"text":"I think Nostrano is by far the best fine dining place I have tried in Madison. The waitresses were friendly and even the bartender was nice to greet you too (which I find it rare since you have waitresses to do that). 

The food is amazing and while I definitely prefer more choices due to my pickiness, I can see why this limited menu choice works so great in their favor. The risotto was packed with flavor despite how simple it sounds. I enjoyed the cocktails they had too."}
{"text":"Went for cocktails the other night - and they were fantastic. For about $8 you'll have a variety of cocktails to choose from. They all tasted great. Sorry to say that they don't have the Orange Nehi anymore - must be seasonal.

Interior is cool, but the space is pretty tight, so don't expect to come without a reservation or bring a large group.

Had one bite of food, and some olives, but I'm planning to get dinner there soon - word on the street is that it's great. The desserts are supposed to kill. Might make 5 stars after dinner."}
{"text":"I've never left a 5 star rating before, but when you wake up the morning after wishing you could eat it all again, I am compelled! We had the salami board, the lamb ragu and then the goat milk cheesecake and we can honestly say it's one of the best meals we can remember. This place is a gold mine I am grateful it's here in Madison."}
{"text":"This has to be the best food I've had in Madison so far. My roommates wanted to come here during restaurant week, and at first I was skeptical of their $35 pre fixe menu when most places were only $25. It was definitely worth it. 

We decided to try to get different things so we could try it all, and there was not a single thing we didn't like. I started with the cauliflower soup, and it was rich and creamy and full of flavor. My roommate ordered the brussels sprout salad, and it was incredible. I've never had brussels sprouts taste so good! My other roommate ordered the pate, which was also fabulous, and served with a fantastic side salad. The mains were also all great - from the orecchini with game sausage to the mushroom risotto to the snapper. The desserts also did not let us down - they were rich and elegant, and the perfect way to finish off the meal. We were so full when we finished that we had to call a cab home!

I'd love to come back here, but it is a little bit pricey. I'll save it for my next big occasion. Again, best food I've had so far in Madison!"}
{"text":"Cannot believe I have not written a review for Nostrano yet. It's one of my favorite places in madison. One that never disappoints.

I always liked everything I had here, with the boudin blanc and the pastas being some of my favorites.

I also often brought guests here and they always seemed happy. And the few times I happens to be dining with a vegan, they've always been able to accommodate them.

Also good wine selection and great desserts!"}
{"text":"I had a salad for lunch. What a disappointment. Too small and over dressed. In keeping with the skimpy portions, it was served with a half piece of bread. This is a $9 salad? Man give me Panera or Bruggers or anywhere else. I left the restraunt and went to another restraunt for lunch. I can just imagine going there at night for a drink that costs the house $.70 cents and charging $9. Very poor value. Very nice decor. Yuck."}
{"text":"I was very excited to check out Nostrano and did so for the first time during restaurant week (RW). Not sure if they were having an off night or if it was the syndrome of not putting your best foot forward for the RW masses but I just wasn't impressed. First the good: very friendly and attentive staff. The hot apple toddy was five stars. Most excellent. It smelled much stronger than it was (a good thing) and was delicious. Perfect for the chilly winter evening. It was served in an adorable little metal pitcher. 

We started with the olives and focaccia (not part of the RW deal) which was good but nothing special. First courses were decent and my lamb terrine was easily the highlight. Something about the farro tabbouleh just fell flat. It lacked any real flavor. Second course was super disappointing. I had the winter squash risotto which lacked any flavor and the risotto was not well cooked. It was just a bowl of orange goo. Very odd. Sadly the walnuts accompanying that dish were the highlight. The bf had the cavatelli which just kinda tasted odd. The pasta was chewy and the sauce was blah.

Dessert was just okay as well. I'm super bummed. And very surprised. I left feeling like Nostrano was capable of so much more. I have a feeling it was the RW syndrome but nothing really made me excited to come back."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty and elegantly presented.  I was impressed with the service, which was snappy.  The portions are quite small for what you pay and the drinks are particularly expensive.  Easily $100 for two people.  Would dine there more if the cost wasn't so prohibitive."}
{"text":"Top of heap for Madison restaurants.  Cocktails were fresh and innovative and food followed suit.  Rivals great restaurants in Chicago.  Interior designer should be shot though - eclectic design that's incredibly confused and close to distasteful."}
{"text":"This is really, really tough. I want to give Nostrano 4 stars (who says that?!), but I can't. 

Their lunch menu for Restaurant Week was mostly unchanged, and that's pretty disappointing to me--I expect more from a restaurant of Nostrano's quality.

However, the entire meal was nearly flawless--service, food cooked perfectly, flavors amazing. 

So naturally, this poses a problem for me--unchanged menu, but superb food?

Yeah, I'll stick with the 5 star rating.

Everything was, as usual, delicious. The panzonella with summer squash, fresh bread, pesto and ricotta? Excellent. The orchiette with pesto and spicy sausage? Um, yeah...fucking awesome.

And that bombolini with salted caramel gelato?! To die for. 

Nostrano, I've got your back. Outstanding."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very expensive, subpar service for the price range.

The brodetto is literally teeming with seafood in a slightly acidic tomato broth. Buckwheat noodles with pesto are extremely al dente, and almost remind us of a thicker buckwheat soba one would find in Japan but with local Madison ingredients. 

Pasta shells with fennel sausage, parsnips, and brussels sprouts are out of site good. I think this is my favorite dish in Madison. 

They recently had an heirloom tomato cocktail special. I thought it'd taste like a bloody mary but instead it was almost an herby grapefruit flavor. It was amazing and closer to a work of art than what usually passes as alcohol. 

Their homemade bread and olives is both elegant and casual, though it's a whopping $6 for a small serving and they don't otherwise bring bread to the table. Basket refills also cost. Bad business.

Desserts are also great and I'd classify them as nearly avant-garde when one combines their different textures and flavors.

Service is about as good as the square's burger joints. Expect to pay $80-100 for two drinks, one appetizer, two dishes, and one dessert. This place is sometimes empty on the weekend -- I worry that they may be pricing themselves well out of range for the 45,000-person pool of UW students right up the street. 

They need a happy hour with some sandwich or small-but-filling plate options. Nostrano is nearly the best restaurant in town, and with a few pricing and serving tweaks the food quality will shine even brighter."}
{"text":"We started off with the bruschetta which is probably the best I've ever had. I wish they had more of it on the dish and not just two slices of bread. I also vote for an abundance of artichokes, but maybe that's just me. 

I ordered the rabbit dish and boyfriend has the orecchiette. My dish was definitely not as I expected had I not looked at the pictures here on Yelp, but it tasted pretty good. The gnocchi was a great consistency and the confit mixed in with the mushrooms was a perfect mix. Again, more more more! 

He liked the orecchiette but did say the sausage was a little too salty for his taste. He likes his pasta more cooked than it really was but he still enjoyed it. 

To be honest, the food was great but there's something about it that isn't exactly making us want to go back anytime soon. Maybe it's the menu choices? We definitely would like to come back and try the quail. Or have a few drinks."}
{"text":"Here is Madison for 10 days for work. On the first day, I stumble across this place. Looked like a great place to dine alone at the bar. Turned out to be a great choice an shave been back 2x since in the ten days in Madison. The bartender was friendly and food was delicious. On day 2, it was craft bar week and the tasting menu was not like your typical nyc Tasting menu. The portions were full portions with full beers!  

What I'd recommend are the scallops and the braised pancetta. Amazing meals and I plan to be back on my many future trips here."}
{"text":"Pretty great! This is one of the more shwanky places near the capitol I think.. Very good food compared to the normal German stuff in WI. I cannot really recommend the Rabbit I had, but my buddies had delicious meals with their chicken and Orechhietti*(sp) meal. Starters was this delicious salami plate. Price is what I would normally expect from a restaurant, but compared to other stuff in Wisconsin, it's cheaper. Very yum!"}
{"text":"Went here for our first anniversary. The drinks were good. The food was good. The service was slow. They were very busy, but that shouldn't hinder on the quality of service. Add another waitress. Add another bartender, and it would have been perfect."}
{"text":"I cam to Nostrano for lunch with a friend and we did it up $100-$120 big. 

For our appetizer we ordered the panzanella which is basically toasted bread with fava beans, tossed with ricotta and what tasted like olive oil and herbs. It was good, whatever it had on it! 

For our entrees, we split the orecchiette with fennel sausage and brussel sprouts and the pappardelle with lamb ragu and a hint of cinnamon. They were very different, but both absolutely fantastic. My friend made orgasm-type faces the whole time, no joke. 

For dessert we got the basque cake and the baked ganache. The ganache was absurdly rich and wonderful. I didn't have much of a basque cake, but I do remember liking it! Not as much as the ganache though, cause nothing can live up to overwhelming chocolate!

For drinks we both had two cocktails. I started with an old fashioned which was, as it should be, strong and bourbon-y. It came in a small glass with a large round ice ball which I absolutely loved. For my second drink I had a summery drink much like lemonade which, unlike the old fashioned, was sweet and perky. Absolutely delicious! 

Overall a wonderful meal. Definitely hurt the wallet, but considering the amount and quality of the food we got I would say that our lunch was an absolute winner!"}
{"text":"Very pleased with Nostrano and would place it among Sardine, Forequarter, and Pig in a Fur Coat as top spots for special occasion dinners. The service is attentive without being overbearing (four stars to our server Tiffany!), the menu covers a lot of bases, and the food delivers. We had the focaccia and olives to start, followed by risotto and quail, with baked ganache and bombolini/affogato for dessert. All the flavors were great and matched excellently. The wine and cocktail lists were some of the best for comparable restaurants in Madison: a range of options and prices, and not too long and overwhelming. The desserts were large, to my delight and satisfaction. (Doughnut lovers: go for the affogato. If the espresso will keep you up, get ready to pop a sleeping pill. It's worth it.) Nothing occasioned one of those revelatory moments where you want to drop to your knees and bow to the dish, but everything was tasty. My only real qualm is that the 90s alt/grunge playlist brings me back to my college dorm, which isn't what I want when I'm dropping some hard earned dollars at a fine restaurant. The casual decor is a nice break from restaurants that take themselves too seriously, but it verges on feeling TOO casual. In other words, not the place for dudes looking to make a dramatic wedding proposal to pop the question."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I went here for our engagement dinner and we couldn't have been happier. We sat for a couple hours and never felt rushed, enjoyed prosecco, wine and cocktails with our app and entrees. The space is small and beautifully decorated, close to the Capitol Building. Service was friendly and fast. We're vegetarian and there wasn't a ton of options but both our fresh pasta and risotto entrees were AMAZING. The pasta literally melted in your mouth it was so fresh and the sauces and ingredients were light yet flavorful and interesting. One of the best dining experiences I've ever had, and I don't think it was just because we just got engaged! It's not cheap but the food and experience is worth it on special occasions."}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable meal this past weekend at Nostrano. After being wait listed at several Capital Sq restaurants, we stumbled upon this lovely establishment. It was busy but there was no wait on a Friday night around 7:30.

Service was good, they did not rush you, and they spaced the courses appropriately. To start, we got the carrot salad and crab bruschetta. Both were unbelievable and started the meal off on a wonderful note. 

For our main course, we got the halibut and Fish broth soup (forgetting the exact name). Both dishes were tasty, however, extremely salty.

The dessert was really the highlight. We got the goat cheese cheesecake with a nut brittle and Rosemary ice cream. It was spectacular and unique. Not too heavy."}
{"text":"Every dish seems to be a home run and always fine the service to be very friendly.  A very interesting menu the is executed flawlessly.  Can make a valid claim as the best in Madison."}
{"text":"Vies with L'Etoile for most elegant food in Madison (but at a lower price!).

My boyfriend and I went here for Valentines Day dinner (actually the weekend afterward) and were amazed by every part of our meal. After asking for and receiving great recommendations from our server, we decided to split two entree dishes - rabbit and gnocchi.  Both were, in a word, delicious.  Though we were both stuffed after dinner, we couldn't resist getting the Affogato desert.  Truly a treat. A modern, quirky Italian treat.

The ambiance was fancy, but also modern and somehow midwestern. The dinner-time look was candlelit dinner mixed with [hip] nostalgia with hints of Italy, sharp angles, and a farm. The clientelle were almost all date-goers.  

Will definitely go back for another special occasion in the future."}
{"text":"Returned to Nostrano last night with part of the ladies progressive dinner. I picked Nostrano because of the excellent experience that I had before. This time, I was embarrassed that I suggested the place. While the dessert was as good as I remembered it, the service was odd and occasionally downright rude. 

Our server did not know the menu and all we were having was dessert and drinks. He couldn't answer questions about drinks, such as \"What is this?\"  He recommended a drink for another in our party and described it as smooth and extremely palatable. When it arrived, it was anything but smooth, instead it was extremely medicinal and sharp. This is fine if that's what you were expecting but she was not. 

We also had people in our party that has some dietary restrictions and they were really unaccommodating. For example, I ordered the Affogato and asked to go easy on the espresso as I'm pregnant. He told me flat out no. I asked him if he was serious and he said yes. He did offer to serve it on the side, however I was just stunned. For such a lovely establishment to be so unaccommodating. It was more like the service that you would get a Dick's Last Resort. You know, where you pay them to be mean to you.

When I have been to Nostrano on a weekend night, when they are much busier, I have received exceptional service. It seemed as if they have their B squad out on week nights. I'm still disappointed thinking about it. In short, I felt like an inconvenience the entire time I was there and like they don't want my business."}
{"text":"I ate here with a group and was very disappointed with the meal.  The salad was just a large bunch of bib lettuce with a tiny bit of dressing.  The meat dish was very small and not worth the money.  I won't go again."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times for lunch.  The first time I was here for their Restaurant Week.  I had their pulled pork shank sandwich.  It was tasty, but I found it a bit greasy overall.  It was served open on a slice of bread.  I think they had drizzled olive oil on the bread before serving which made it heavy.  

I was here this past Thursday for lunch with some friends.  It was pretty empty for lunch and this was evidenced by the fact that they only had one person working front of house.  I ordered their buckwheat tagliatelle this time.  It came with a poached egg on top and it was pretty tasty, but I would've preferred the tagliatelle cooked a bit longer.  Even though I like my noodles to have a bit of a chew, I found these noodles to be a bit hard.  It was still tasty though and the portion size just right.  

If you're looking for a slow tasty lunch, this is a nice place.  Their desserts are also amazing, but they're really pricy.  I might have to make another visit come Restaurant Week time."}
{"text":"I visited for lunch on a Friday afternoon. It's a lovely building in a fun location. I had the Whole Wheat Pappardelle with lamb ragu. This choice was a delicious and comforting. The pasta is fresh and the ragu had so many layers of flavors going. I could eat this every day.  I passed on dessert, but the menu had some amazing choices--goat milk cheesecake--intriguing.  Service was very good as is the people watching on The Square."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. Great food and a nice wine selection. I recommend the scallops or almost any pasta dish."}
{"text":"Overall the food was good, though overworked.

However, the menu is pretentious with ingredients that not even the wait staff understood or were able to explain.  Would have expected a focus on simple ingredients instead of useless layering of unecessary ingredients that do not improve flavors or stand out.

Prices were in line with other downtown restaurants.

Would not go again."}
{"text":"Nostrano brings an interesting and innovative take of Mediterranean food to the table. Easily, Nostrano belongs on any list of \"must try good eats\" in the Madison area.

My wife and I visited Nostrano during restaurant week. We had made reservations so we were seated immediately upon arrival. The atmosphere was very modern and well decorated. It provided a relaxing atmosphere compared to the hustle of the city outside.

Service was slow at times, but it wasn't horrible. I definitely do wish that our server had been slightly more attentive during the visit. Our main dish felt like it took forever to arrive, which was strange since the menu was shortened for restaurant week. I feel that the kitchen should have been really moving along considering.

For an appetizer I had the gamebird terrine, which is essentially fancy bologna. It was very well prepared, and it paired nicely with the pine nuts and jam. I just wish there was more jam and crackers!

My main course was halibut served over leek gnocchi with a mushroom broth. All things considered, the fish was cooked perfectly and the broth was delicious. I do feel that there were not nearly enough gnocchi under the fish. I think there were at most 8 tiny gnocchi.

For dessert I had the affogato. There's not much to say here because the dish was executed classically and well. If you love your espresso with a touch of dessert, this dish is your pick."}
{"text":"I ordered the lamb ragu because the yelp reviews were raving about it, but I'm not sure why that was. It was extremely over priced. The taste was not equivalent to the price value. Ordered the affogato for dessert. It was good, but it really just tasted like a fried donut rolled in sugar. Nothing special, but I would rather spend a few dollars on mini donuts than eat at this over priced restaurant. Environment is definitely an older crowd as well. I wouldn't recommend going here. If you want a nice Italian restaurant with lower prices I would recommend Cento."}
{"text":"Fresh. Flavorful. Good service. Great Sazerac. Couldn't have had a better New Year's Eve."}
{"text":"We have been to Nostrano twice, a year apart, and both times it was amazing. Great cocktails, carefully made, great beer selection, and a fantastic chef/ kitchen that will amaze your tastebuds. Beautiful interior, good service. A top pick when I am in Madison. Be sure to make reservations!"}
{"text":"I agree with much of Erin Hanusa's recent Isthmus review (http://www.thedailypage.com/isthmus/article.php?article=31323) of Nostrano. I sampled most of the same dishes she reviewed, with a couple minor variations, and I found the food to be expertly prepared and refined while still fitting in with Madison's affinity for rustic, comfort, local and seasonal food. I often think some kind of goofball molecular gastronomy place will never work here, for example. The cauliflower soup was delightfully presented with sprigs of romanesco and a delicious crouton, which made for a tasty counterpoint, texture and flavorwise, to the creaminess of the soup.  The risotto featuring pheasant confit was a tangy surprise.  The flavors were earthy and strong, but it fit nicely with the soup and felt seasonally and thematically appropriate.  Entrees of crispy chicken and braised beef were excellent.  In the latter case, I've recently sampled the same dish at a number of Madison restaurants and this is the best implementation yet, with the beef so tender it fell apart on the fork and the tang of the accompanying sauce enhancing the beef's rich flavor even further, while cutting any heaviness that may have resulted in the beef alone. Desserts were also excellent, as were the two vintage throwback cocktails we tried.

That having been said, with the exception of the hostess, who was very pleasant, welcoming and friendly, the service was terrible. The waiter who we had became visibly irritated/angry when my dining partner asked to retain her menu, so that she could read it while sampling the dishes we'd selected. She was still speaking when he turned on his heel and walked away from her in mid-sentence. In shock, I considered donning my coat and leaving at that point. He came back a moment later - to apologize? Actually, he said that the previous interaction had \"thrown\" him and he needed to ask me once again what my food selections were.

It really was bizarre.

Meanwhile, the other server helping tables near us seemed to be very nice, and she was engaging with the customers quite differently - I longed to have been seated in her section. I spent the meal feeling quite uncomfortable and the incident frankly ruined an otherwise splendid meal. The bad vibe was topped off as we left, when I turned and thanked the bartender who was standing at the door and who'd made our cocktails. He just stared back into my face, without returning a comment, smiling or acknowledging that I had spoken. What?

So, I really have to give this new restaurant probably 4/5 stars for its right-out-of-the-gate spot-on culinary success. But I think I'll retain a rating for service at this point, hoping against hope that this was a fluke. We choose our favorite downtown dining spots - Magnus, Sardine and so on, not only based on their excellent food but because of the pleasant, comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. Good food is a baseline in the downtown Madison scene. Service and ambiance has to be part of the equation, too, for the place to make it on my return list. I compare this to my other recent foray into the Underground Kitchen, whose dishes need some refinement but whose staff was clearly engaged in a labor of love, and eager to share the love with the customers (maybe slightly too much, as the chef took a seat at our table without any warning!)."}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite fancy place in town!  We've been here for restaurant weeks, valentine's dinner, lunch/dinners.  Always so tasty and memorable.  I always eat and lick everything off my plate- the flavors are complex and carefully crafted to blend together well.  Robust and beautifully plated dishes.  I enjoy the orchietto pasta (sp?) and octopus salad.  Drinks are strong and unique.  Highly recommended as a place to take a special friend, co worker or date.  Not a large space so reservations recommended for dinner."}
{"text":"Just as I said last year, this place is tops in Madison.  Went with my gf for a great meal.  Homemade egg pasta, morels, ramps...oh my!  For nothing else, just stop in for a dessert and coffee.  Amazing and creative options that will knock your socks off."}
{"text":"You know how in some 80's-late 90's movies there's that one new person that comes into class and everyone's like, \"Daaaaaaaaayum!\"?

That \"person\" is this restaurant.

I went here last night with my significant other for our anniversary dinner and it was just too good. I got the braised beef short ribs which came with gnocchi and swiss chard (I had the cipollini removed due to food allergies). The gnocchi was so tender it melted in my mouth and had a wonderful buttery taste, some had a more bitter taste because of being placed near the swiss chard. My significant other got the pork shoulder agrodolce and thought it was \"good\" (his words, not mine.) It had an almost barbecue-like taste to it because of the cannellini beans.

Both of us got the same dessert, the Torta which was a sponge cake with a coffee mousse, some maple agrodolce on the plate with a coconut gelato on the side. The gelato barely had a coconut taste, but it was very nice and not too sweet.

Service was nice, our waitress came at the right time and refilled our glasses and anything else we might have needed. The place is a little small, but I think it adds to its charm. A little difficult to hear the person you're with sometimes, though.

The only complaint I've really got about this place is that there's some disjoint to the dishes: for example, two of the items on my plate (short ribs and gnocchi) were savory, and then had one extremely bitter item (swiss chard) that seemed out of place. This was the same issue with the dessert--the coconut gelato, maple agrodolce, and cake were all fairly sweet--and then the coffee taste from the mousse and the coffee grounds on the side made for a really awkward and overwhelming taste. I'd much prefer it if the entire plate was balanced, but that's a personal preference.

Overall, I really liked this place and would definitely come back. Daaaayum, Nostrano, you lookin' fine."}
{"text":"We spotted Nostrano whilst strolling around the Capitol, & recognized it from a recent list of Madison's 20 Hottest Restaurants. It lived up to its ranking. 

Cocktails were fantastic, my rum punch with hibiscus flavored ice cubes: now THAT'S what's up. The salad was just okay, but my girlfriends kind of brisket sandwich was great, & i think im comfortable saying that my whitefish sandwich was one of the best sandwiches I've had in as long as I can remember. 100 delicious flavors playing off of eachother, & drowning in sauce just the way I like it. Delicious. The place also has a great look to it. 

The only thing keeping me from posting 5 stars is the fact that I only had lunch there. If I ever make it back to Madison for dinner there & it delivers like lunch did, I might have to boost this baby on up."}
{"text":"Came in with a group and had the wait staff jump to get all of our tables together immediately so we could sit right by the beautiful window view. Then, without having to blink, our server came to our side to have drinks and appetizers ordered within ten minutes. We had the salami board which was enough to fed six people and the sourdough board. My dinner was the cavatelli which had huge chunks of lamb marinated to perfection. I would definitely recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Went back for about the 10th time, and it was a great experience. They had an heirloom tomato appetizer special which was delicately flavored and otherwise spectacular, and I had the quail, which was also fantastic. Skillful drink preparation for not that much coin. Still a gem and worth going to at any opportunity."}
{"text":"This may be my favorite place in town. Dishes are imaginative and well portioned. Oh, and f'ing fantastic. Their cocktail, the Fistful of Dollars, is probably my favorite drink in town. Great, great spot."}
{"text":"we finally got a chance to check this place out yesterday (v-day). we had a reservation and were seated immediately. 

we started with beers and the marinated olives. the beer list is small, but stellar - dragon's milk on tap? yes please. my fiance had a gulden draak. the olives came with a lovely rustic bread and were yummy, but unpitted. i'll admit we weren't sure about the proper way to go about eating them. i hope no one was offended that hands were used.

i ordered the snapper brodetto, a slightly spicy tomato-based seafood stew with clams, mussels and squid. it was wonderful. my fiance had the orecchiette and really liked it. the plating on all of these dishes was simple and elegant. 

we went for the gold and ordered crema for dessert... it was SO good. the olive oil gelato, bittersweet chocolate cream and toasted ciabatta played very nicely together. the candied kumquat was a pretty garnish, but it tasted a bit like christmas and didn't really seem to go with the rest of the dish.

our server was very friendly and attentive. the rustic decor is cozy and inviting, but i found the music selection a bit disjointed... the clash, misfits and ramones are awesome bands, but nostrano is not a punk rock dive bar, so it seemed like an odd choice. anyway... all in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is such a great place, I don't know where to begin. The salads are amazing, the drinks, the ambiance, and the entrées are all top-notch. The offagato for desert is a must."}
{"text":"Hmmmm... my third five-star review ever (and for some reason the other two are for vegetarian restaurants, and neither are in Madison!)

I think this is my favorite \"nice\" restaurant in Madison.  Plenty of other places I'd rather go if I was looking for something specific (like Chinese or Indian!), but if you're looking for a nice dinner somewhere that is neither fancy or formal (but that has food and prices that might fall into that category), this place nails it.

This is the kind of place where it is clear that the chef has thought about every single thing that is in the dish or on the plate.  The kind of place where I find myself thinking about and focusing on every bite.

I guess the only caveat was that my wife was not a fan of the cauliflower soup and thought it was a bit bland (but the mushrooms in it were great).  Other than that, everything was phenomenal, and the service was friendly and unpretentious. 

I know this place gets pegged as \"Italian\"... it's definitely closer to \"new American\" (whatever that means)."}
{"text":"I went with my girlfriend and her sister for my girlfriends 21st birthday (before we obviously went out HARD to the bars).

We shared a charcuterie plate, which was very good, but not as good as Underground Kitchen (RIP).  We also shared a carpaccio dish for starters, which was fantastic. Then, for entrees, between us we had a gnocchi dish, lamb ragu & a fennel/brussel sprouts/sausage/citrus dish.  All three were beyond incredible.  Tons of bold flavors.

Desert was also wildly incredible.

Overall, definitely the best meal I've had in Madison."}
{"text":"I had built up some high expectations from things I had heard from friends and coworkers and folks I knew who worked there. So perhaps I just expected too much. 
   Which is not to say anything was BAD. Certainly not.  Everything was perfectly acceptable, if a little overpriced for the level of enjoyment of food / quantities. 
    The menu is small and somewhat lacking in descriptors, and our waitress (who was friendly, smiled, knew her business, attentive but not overbearing) apologized that some of the descriptors were actually incorrect when we asked about them.  (Wrong type of nut listed, wrong vegetable ingredient, etc.) They had also made some subsitutions in some of the things we ordered, and did not tell us (or the staff apparently) about these changes until we pointed out that what we had did not match the menu.
     The bison tartare had a lovely texture and I was really excited about it, but turned out to have almost no flavor at all. The greens and oil that accompanied it were all that could be tasted, though the combo of textures was very pleasing. I tried some of the paper-thin bison (which had to be carefully and painstakingly scraped of the plate with a fork or knife and spread onto a crostini) all by iteself, and still could only detect the lightest of beefy flavors. I can compliment it's subtlety, but I would have preferred to actually taste my food a bit more.
     The pasta's we ordered (we passed them around a little) were fresh and properly cooked. Perfectly al dente. Several of the dishes were very good, most were just good. Nothing was so good that anyone said, \"wow, you have to try this one.\"
    The lamb dish contained almost no perceivable lamb. A nut-based pasta had several fried herb leaves that were far too large and overpowering to be eaten without singing the palate; other bits were pleasantly small,crisp notes in proper proportion.  Notes of lemongrass served another dish very well, 
   The signature cocktails were tasty, if somewhat unspectacular. (A $15 cocktail turned out to occupy only half of a small champagne flute.) Nothing left me feeling scammed or unpleased, but nothing left me excited to tell people that I had finally gotten around to really trying the place out. 
     The atmosphere is pleasing though, the decor is 4 stars and a nice mix of upscale and accessibly trendy. (On a silly note, their bathrooms were quite lovely and originally decorated, not to mention spotless.)"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend to Nostrano and we had a pretty good experience.  I had Whole Wheat Pasta With Lamb Ragu.  It was absolutely delicious.  My Girlfriend had red snapper with Clams and Mussels.  Another very good dish.  My only issue with Nostrano is the menu.  They have a very small menu.  So when you go there and they are out of certain dishes you might only have 3 things to choose from.  But overall, I would say give this place a try."}
{"text":"Thank you Nostrano for a fabulous night out in Madison. I count this among my new favorite restaurants... if only I lived closer instead of in Chicago so I could become a more frequent patron.

For drinks: everything on the menu looked creative and enticing. I went with the rhubarb3, which didn't disappoint, and also sampled a couple others. Looked like they had a very nice wine list as well - my husband had a glass of Primitivo and was happy.

We skipped appetizers in favor of dessert, but I wish I would have stuffed myself with olives and/or the scallops in addition to the rest of our primo meal. We went straight for the entrees, and were very impressed with the chicken meatballs (just a little spicy kick) and the lamb ragu pasta. The lamb was perfectly spiced with something akin to cinnamon or allspice, for a rich and comforting flavor. Also had the whitefish with a side of roasted vegetables, which was definitely the healthiest of our dishes but still nicely flavored and very fresh-tasting. 

For dessert we had the torta, which had a nice slightly salted taste to one of the layers (chocolate+salt = delicious). Also the salted caramel gelato with an espresso wash - I didn't like this one quite as much, but the rest of my fellow diners were in heaven. Finished up with some coffee, and lingered in the restaurant chatting for at least 40 minutes after our meal. Our servers were happy to let us linger and continued to fill our water glasses, making us feel very welcome and at ease. 

Decor is subtle, with a nice blend of sophistication and country charm. I can't wait until our next Madison visit so I can run back to Nostrano!"}
{"text":"The food is prepared at a very high gastronomic level.  Small place and somewhat intimate with nice ambiance.  Poor layout as there really are no \"good tables\" to be had.  Waitstaff was ok but slow - not up to the level of the food.  Went on our 30th wedding anniversary which we stated on arrival but seemed to be no big deal to them."}
{"text":"Chicago magazine featured Nostrano 2 years ago and I've been wanting to try them ever since. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. My husband and I went here with another couple for dinner last night and I can't say we had a great experience.

First off we all ordered a cocktails and the salumi board to start with. We also wanted to order the scallops, but they were out so we decided to order the snapper crudo instead. 

Drinks arrived and they were good. Interesting and refreshing, but not amazing. I can't remember the name of my drink but it had cucumber and gin and it was just a little off balance for my taste (too heavy on the sweet/cucumber). But my husband loved one of his. Unfortunately, one of the other people we were with did not like hers at all and never drank any of it.

The salumi board was great and a bunch of different wonderful meats to try and a nice pickled vegetable salad. The pate on the board was especially stellar. The crudo was just ok. The snapper itself isn't a very flavorful fish, but the ingredients it was paired with was nice. Unfortunately I got an extremely chewy piece and that kind of turned me off of eating any more of it.

My husband ordered the rabbit boudin blanc and confit and he gave me a bite of his nettle gnocchi that came with it and that was AWESOME. Perfect texture, creamy rich taste, delicious. I ordered the lamb ragu pappardelle and while I can totally recognize that it was a fantastic dish, it was spicy. There was definitely nothing on the menu to indicate that (though on the online menu I see now it lists harissa, it doesn't say that in house, it says cinnamon instead which is \"spicy,\" but not in the same way) and unfortunately it was too spicy for me to really eat and enjoy my whole dish. My friend ordered the tagliatelle with walnut pesto and she really didn't like it so I offered to trade her my lamb ragu since it was too spicy. But hers was oddly bitter (probably from the rye and radicchio) so I didn't get far there either.

In the end we left with a $200 bill and one drink completely not drunk and two dishes of pasta only eaten about 20% of the way. Pretty big bummer. The guys were happy, and my husband loved every single dish and would probably rate this place much higher than I, but I left hungry and disappointed. :("}
{"text":"Not impressed, look toward any of Madison's other establishments. 

The best thing about Nostrano was our friendly host and his effort to get us a table on an otherwise double-booked Saturday night. We promised him to order and dine quickly so they could have the table for the next party. We ordered 3 dishes and it took an hour for them to come out and they were warm rather than hot. The dishes were the Rabbit Boudin blanc and confit, Snapper brodetto, and Rigatoncini. They were just ok while the rabbit boudin tasted bland. I visited Pig in a Fur Coat earlier and ordered more dishes for a dollar less and left very happy and satisfied. To top it off our waitress had the personality of April in Parks and Recreation and although they apologized they didn't take anything off our bill. At first I overlooked our wait because the host said they were double booked but after noticing a few empty tables I wasn't very understanding.

I hate to say this but I had a better time getting burgers at Dotty's for a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow. Mille grazie to Corey D for suggesting Nostrano for lunch. It was a very welcome respite from the gloomy tunes playing outside. 

The reviews are stellar and on point, so I don't think I need to go into too great of detail. Allow me to give you just a few snippets...

Decor: Is lovely, homey but still modern and minimalist. Large slab tables and a few booths, cool shutters and windows displayed on the wall and a beautiful bar.

Menu: Also nicely edited. A small but mighty menu that will likely have something for various tastes. Do yourself a favor and get the orecchiette. It is beautiful - a moderate lunch sized portion is still ample and filled with perfectly cooked ears of pasta and sprinkled with delightful fennel sausage bits, root veg and a few greens. It is just smashing. 

Service: Friendly, knowledgeable and leaves you to enjoy your meal. Just what I was looking for. 

Do not overlook the desserts - the affogato is not to be missed! I mean, really, who would be able to pass up caramel gelato, sea salt, espresso, bombolini (donuts). Not this girl. I don't care how full you are, get the affogato."}
{"text":"Lovely place.  Had the homemade jam soda, warm chicory salad with roasted sunchokes and soft egg, and perfect al dente whole wheat pappardelle with cinnamon lamb ragu.  Great service at the bar...really talented bartender that weeknight.  Watched him make an absolutely flawless Ramos Gin Fizz.  Shook that thing for days.  Really cool."}
{"text":"What did I miss? If this is the best restaurant in Madison, we're pretty doomed. 

The waiter was great. Cordially greeted us, and suggested us delicious Rose to begin with. And I usually don't even like Rose, but it was perfect for a hot summer night. A cocktail called Kirby, also pointed out by out waiter, was fantastic as well. 

Food, meh. I like the concepts behind all dishes. The radish salad came out looking lovely, but a bit over-dressed. Dressing wasn't anything special. Soft-shell crab was salty whatever, so was my bf's pasta. The house made pasta had lovely eggy color and texture, but nothing more to write about. And the dessert was dreadful.   Too sweet, not particularly enlightening presentation or flavor.

I love the interior decoration. Very chic. I can definitely come back for cocktails."}
{"text":"A wonderful place for an anniversary dinner. While we made reservations, it surprisingly didn't appear needed on a Friday night around 8pm. I would've preferred a table further in the back where the setting is a little more intimate and not as cramped near the door, but still not a terrible table considering. 

The bar service was fabulous. If you're a whiskey fan, don't hesitate to try one of their bourbon cocktails.

The food - in presentation, quantity, and quality - was incredible.  I ordered the Bruschetta appetizer and an on-special creamy, pesto pork dinner (apologies the name escapes me). It couldn't have been done better. Dessert was a raspberry-drizzled, chocolate slice of \"ohmygod.\" The menu can be a little intimidating as some of the items are likely less familiar, but don't be afraid to ask (or google). The only downfall was the \"no substitutions\" in any manner - to add in or take off. I found that a bit off-putting, but nonetheless ordered a dish much to my liking without needing any special instruction.

While the seat option for a reservation table wasn't the best, the partially-intimate setting was still beautiful. I would've personally preferred a server with a little more salesmanship, but she did a fine job.

Most definitely looking forward to a return visit. Check out their page to see their specials, both dining and cocktails, as they rotate frequently."}
{"text":"AMAZING place! After one visit, it's hard not to call this one of my favorite places in town. It has a fun, casual atmosphere and incredible food and cocktails. They are the only place in Madison (that I know of) that has soft shell crab and their braised Panchetta is incredible! I would definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Really good home-made pasta. We ordered the Lamb pasta and the chicken pasta. If you want to get technical, it was the spicy chicken popette paccheri & the whole wheat pappardelle lamb ragu.

Both were excellent, plentiful portions, inventive and delicious. presentation was wonderful. The desert of Affogato was really good. We had beer with our dinner instead of wine, and the beer selection seemed great. 

The interior is very cool, it is elegant and upscale without trying too hard.

Some reviews here complained about accommodations for large groups. This place is relatively small and not really suited for groups larger than 4 in my opinion. It's great for a date however."}
{"text":"Better service might have got them five stars from us.  I began with a cocktail called \"Never Rub Another Man's Rhubarb,\" named from one of my favorite quotes from Batman, spoken by Jack Nicholson (the Joker) to Michael Keaton (as Batman, well, Bruce Wayne).  It means the person speaking wants the listener to keep away from his woman.   The cocktail consisted of Milagro Select Barrel Reposado Tequila, East India Sherry, Caramelized Rhubarb, St George Agricole Rum, and Lime.  It might have come a bit sooner, but it was a very good choice on my part for the beginning of the dining experience.  Mitchell and I began with BRUSCHETTA made from grilled country bread, fresh mozzarella, charred summer squash, anchoiade, and salsa verde.  It was very nice, though a just bit greasy.  Next came a denouement, it just took too long for our food to arrive, we arrived at 7:00 but our food didn't make it to the table until some minutes after 8:00; the service was the problem.  The waitress explained that it was only her second night there, but frankly, for me, that's only an excuse, and not an acceptable reason for a problem with service.  She ought to know, for instance, that what I'd chosen to drink with dessert was beer, not wine.  Also, the wine we drank, while quite nice, was too warm.  It was the same temperature as the room, and should have been in the 50s, from a cellar or wine cave.  At any rate, our remaining courses came together:  Cornflour tagliatelle made with sweet corn crema, marcona almonds, basil, cracked pepper, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese - delicious!  Rigatoncini made with beef short rib ragu, harissa, roasted parsnips, ricotta, and tangerine arumato - also delicious, though we didn't love it quite as much as the tagliatelle.  Grilled Sturgeon made with fava bean scafata, artichokes, escarole, fregola sarda, and green tahini - also delicious, almost like sweetbreads, while somewhat chicken-like, we both loved it, and for me, it was what was calling me to try out this restaurant, it's been on their menu for some weeks.  The waitress couldn't tell me what type of sturgeon it was, but said that the \"chef-owner\" would come out and talk to me about it.  He never made it, apparently being too busy, which I understand.  I left my name and contact info, we'll see if he gets back to me.  Last, we had roasted quail, prepared with green garlic sausage, farro, spiced chickpeas, zhoug, purple dragon carrots, and yogurt.  We think we also saw a lot of pomegranate kernels on the platter, too, but they're not mentioned on the menu.  The quail was also lovely, though perhaps not quite to the height of the sturgeon, still, excellent.  We opted not to choose any dessert, but instead took a trip to a bakery in an older neighborhood of Madison for something else that Mitchell was in the mood for.  Perhaps after a subsequent trip to that place, a review will follow.  So, the food here is likely to call back, but the service may or may not stop us coming again.  A similar dinner at another restaurant right off of the square might be a better choice, as we quite loved dinner at Cento.
_________________
UPDATE:  It is now five days later, so the \"chef-owner\" has had a plenty of time to give me a call about the sturgeon, but no call has come.  That's pretty disappointing, and tells me they don't really care a lot about customer service (the poorly performing waitress) or customer satisfaction (nobody bothering to inform me about the fish).  We've had far far better responses from restaurants, and definitely better service.  For not getting back to me, I'm lowering the score by one star, from **** to ***."}
{"text":"Food quality is very good. Think modern chef-y Italian instead of mom n pop red sauce Italian and you get the general idea. I'd say 4 stars for the food. 

I knock my rating down to 3 stars because of the prices. To me, everything on the menu is priced a few dollars too high, and they really get you with the drink prices too. 

If a dinner for 2 with a couple drinks per person here came out to maybe $70-80ish, I'd give it a 4 or possibly 5 star rating. But I can't help but feel that Nostrano is a bit pricey for my general satisfaction level with the food."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time, after having heard great reviews for years. Had the martini (amazing), the salad with the pork cheek (fantastic), the lamb paparradelle (great), and the rabbit plate (good). Also some dessert but it's hazy because of the wine. A little pricey, and the ambiance is kinda meh, but the food and service was great."}
{"text":"Okay, as frequently happens this is really a 3.5 star review, but that's not an option. That being said, this was easier to round down to three than up to 4. I had very high hopes for Nostrano and unfortunately they were not realized on my first visit. 

Some terms I would use to describe my experience and the food at Nostrano: 
Good, fresh, sweet, light, straightforward, fine, pleasant

Some terms I would NOT use: 
Excellent, surprising, complex, rich, deep, luscious, robust

The 'yes' terms are all fine and in some settings are even desireable but for a pretty expensive meal I'm looking for at least a few of those fun guys from the 'no' list to make an appearance and they just didn't. Pretty much every dish (including drinks) was prepared competently but lacked any sort of pizzazz. 

Started with a daiquiri which was fine, but a little sweeter than it should have been and a Sauvignon Blanc from Loire which was not at all to my liking but enjoyed by my wife. The charcuterie board was fine but was lacking anything with spice and would have benefitted from a bit more crunch in one or more of the accoutrements. Also, call me crazy but I don't think a summer sausage makes the cut for this sort of dish; give me a nice salty ham or something instead. The rillette was fine but neither of us really enjoyed the salumi or the pate-foam. We also tried the bruschetta, which was fine although the anchoiade was a bit overpowering. 

For mains I tried the semolina cavatelli and my wife had the rigatoncini. The cavatelli was fine and the carrots and lamb sausage REALLY complimented one another. The carrots eaten without the sausage were a little too sweet which lent a somewhat unbalanced sweetness to the dish as a whole. The Rigatoncini was fine (do you see a trend???) and there seemed to be a fair bit of nutmeg and/or clove that highlighted the sweet character of the dish. The ricotta in particular in the rigatoncini would have benefited VASTLY from some fresh cracked black pepper. 

Finally we shared the affogato for dessert. This was not fine, it was GREAT! Far and away the best thing we had at Nostrano was the affogato! From what I've seen dessert is a strong suit for this restaurant, and it would probably be the thing I'd be most likely to return for.

Overall the service was fine, but not at all exceptional very much like the food. Almost every dish would have benefitted from a bit more spice, or salt, or crunch, or citrus, or SOMETHING! I'd hesitate to say what we had was bland, it really wasn't, but neither was it exciting nor memorable. I can't say it's likely I'll return to Nostrano since I know there are better restaurants in Madison but I wouldn't rule it out as an impossibility either. The only things I can say for certain is if I did return I would DEFINITELY get the affogato..."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the wine pairing was an affordable treat.  The goat cheese cheesecake is to die for. It's not too sweet and very light. They have great service as well."}
{"text":"Rude bartender. Stressed out wait staff. They need an attitude adjustment at this place. 
Food is good but they could really use a manager who can keep the staff upbeat and on the ball. $28 for a plate of food needs to come with the full package."}
{"text":"Last time I was in Madison, I truly enjoyed the dining experience here. I remembered that I had the risotto dish that was heavenly. When I would think about Madison, I would think about that dish.

With my most recent visit, I made it a point to come back here to get the risotto!! About the restaurant, it's a tiny space at the corner near the Capitol building. It's got about 12 small tables, and some bar seats. It's a great place to have one of those intimate-conversation type of place. I ordered the risotto again, but it wasn't the same as what I had last time. I had a cheesier variety last time. This time, it was as creamy, and melt-in-your-mouth as last time, but it had potatoes and tiny little flowers in it. Interesting. I prefer the other variety I had, but oh well.

The dessert was the best part of dinner. It was a really dense block of chocolate ganache, with seared marshmallow, on a river of caramel (that's what I think it is, at least), some graham cracker crumbs, and some kind of gelato. This description is not doing it any justice. It was so good though! I would definitely come here again when I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but I think the food has gone downhill or the prices have gone too high for Madison. I had the soft shell crab appetizer for $17 and the asparagus risotto for $23. The appetizer was a bruschetta with a strong sauce but nothing to write home about. The risotto sauce was too creamy and the risotto was lacking melted cheese (which I consider the number one ingredient for Risotto). Something was definitely off but I can't pinpoint what it was. 
I hope the owners of this place check more often on the quality of the dishes because it's a nice and trendy little gem.  Maybe I ordered the wrong items. However, at these prices everything should be good. 
I know for a fact the desserts are spectacular here but I did not order any because I was already down because my selections did not meet my expectations."}
{"text":"Inventive menu, great space, good service, interesting drink menu, and great local ingredients.  

I had the braised pancetta--which was incredible.  The radish salad was good--not great.  

Nostrano is a very good restaurant, but I wouldn't put it in the same category as L'Etoile.  People who think that Nostrano is Madison's finest restaurant haven't been to some of the other places around the square."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a great Italian restaurant in Madison, which is why I chose Nostrano for dinner. We started with two appetizers, the salumi board and the bruschetta. We enjoyed both, and they came out pretty promptly. For entrees, we chose the whole wheat pappardelle in a pesto sauce and the shellfish bucatini. These took quite a bit longer to come out, to the point of impatience. The pappardelle was delicious and I ate every bite, but the shellfish bucatini was really unimpressive. The sauce sounded awesome as it included lobster, fennel and oregano, but I found it very bland. It needed a little spice or something to make it more interesting, but it fell flat and I wished I had ordered something else. We ordered desserts, which also took a while to come out. Both the Meyer lemon mousse and the baked chocolate ganache were flavorful and beautifully crafted. 

All and all, the food itself probably earned four stars, but I was not very impressed with the service. It was a long, drawn out meal (more so than your average nice meal), and though our server was nice, we had to point out that we needed refills on our beverages more than once."}
{"text":"While I would agree that the food was good, it's hard to get over first impressions.  After a much longer than anticipated drive from Chicago, we were eager to try out a place recommended by Chicago magazine; that - and the fact that chef is apparently a transplant from Chicago.  

I called the restaurant en route to advise that we'll be 15 minutes late; \"no problem,\" I was told.  When we arrived, hostess looked surprised that we actually showed up.  She shared a few whispering sessions with a couple of other people at the restaurant and not until I gave her a look to ask what's up that she told me that there was some \"confusion\" with the tables and that we could either sit outside (not the best view) or wait 30 minutes for a table inside.  

Desperate for some dinner since it was already getting late, we chose to take the outside table.  Needless to say, as good as the food was, it was hard to enjoy it when our table was next to a compost pail and our \"music accompaniment\" were trucks parking on the street. For what they charge at this place, the manager could have come out, offered a dessert or something for the inconvenience or at least an apology.  Not the best way to start our Madison trip."}
{"text":"Easily one of the two best restaurants in Madison. The pasta is phenomenal and extremely filling, the cocktails/drink selections are very solid, and the dessert menu is always creative. The menu is small, though, so if you have any dietary restrictions it would pay to check out the menu in advance."}
{"text":"I love lamb. Not to be confused with I love lamp.

But let's start at the beginning. The marinated olives and sourdough focaccia was the perfect starter. What looks to be normal bread is actually a tasty homemade loaf of deliciousness that you can dip in marinated olives. Who needs a plain plate of olive oil when you can dip it into actual olive juice with tasty olive treats.

I was very excited to see Whole Wheat Pappardelle with lamb ragù. The pappardelle noodles were fresh and al dente, just the way they should be served. The lamb ragu was incredibly flavorful with the whole dish looking small but being incredibly filling to the point where I couldn't finish it all. But then there's dessert...

I was full, but that didn't mean I couldn't indulge in a little sweets action. I mean, c'mon. We ordered up the Affogato (caramel gelato, sea salt, espresso, bombolini). I would have never thought to put gelato in a pool of warm espresso, but hey, that's why I'm an awful baker (and cook for that matter). The gelato ran into the espresso and made a dreamy concoction that could satisfy you alone. But no, there's more. Served on the side are four tiny sugared donuts. Added dipping bonus round! 

I also thought it was nice that this restaurant doesn't scream Italian. It doesn't have pictures of granny's making pasta or vines of grapes hanging from the walls. It's modern, sleek and clean. Perfect for lunch, dinner or dessert. Like... you should go in for all three because you'd be cheating yourself if you didn't!"}
{"text":"I have been to Nostrano many times, as their menu changes seasonally. On my last visit, we ordered the salumi board and olives to start. Both were delicious, but the salumi was outstanding. So many combinations of meat/mustard/garnishes to create both sweet and savory bites, depending on what pleases your palate.

For dinner, I ordered the rigatoncini (lamb ragu sauce). The sauce was deeply savory, but the pasta was lackluster -- it sat backseat to the sauce rather than being a strong part of the dish. 

Both of my parents ordered the pork and loved it. I tried a couple bites and wish I could have had more. The dish is well thought out and each component contributes to the overall flavor of the dish."}
{"text":"I've tried Nostrano twice - once for dinner about a month ago and once, this week, during Restaurant Week, for lunch.  Both times the service was inattentive and slow.  During the dinner experience we were very disappointed to find issues with the food (capers where there shouldn't have been any and surprise pistachios in the salumi/pates - an issue with my allergic dining companion).  We were even more disappointed by the slow service.  A simple dinner took all night due to 20-30 minute delays between courses and a server no where to be found to redrinks, etc.  My experience this week for lunch was more of the same.  A lunch with reservations turned into 2 hours away from the office and we had to leave before being served the dessert.  What I've been able to eat I've enjoyed but I will not be back due to the experiences I've had with the service."}
{"text":"Went here a months ago on a cold and rainy evening for dinner and I can't say enough about the quality of food this restaurant serves. I had their Braised Pancetta (pork belly, kale, etc) and my husband had the Orecchiette (fennel sausage, brussels sprouts, etc.) . . . DE-LI-CIOUS. The restaurant is small (like several other locations in Downtown Madison) and intimate so I wouldn't recommend it for groups larger than 4."}
{"text":"I will start off with the notion that the food world totally overuses the word \"local\".  Very rarely is there a place that truly does \"local\" food, with the Angry Trout in Grand Marais, MN being an exception.  Nostrano abuses that term even though Nostrano means \"local\".  Let's go through a list of what isn't local from their menu.  This list includes Olives, Octupus, Yellowtail Crudo, Meyer Lemon, Taleggio, Aged Balsamic vinegar, vanilla bean, cocoa nibs, seafood brodetto (there is no seafood in Wisconsin), nocellara olives, Madeira, ceylon cinnamon, Marcona Almonds, kumquats, Sicilian Pistacchios, Pomelo, etc.  Plus the wines are from all over the world.  Being in Southern Wisconsin, there should be no beers from outside the area because that is one thing we have plenty of good selections.  Grolsh should not be on the beer list.  

That brings me to my point.  Who cares whether it is local or not?!!  It just has to taste good.  Food moves around the world and thank god it does.  I like seafood in Wisconsin.  Although Walleye, Trout, Northern Pike, Perch, Sturgeon, and other local fish are tasty.  

Let's just shutup about the \"local\" b.s., admit it is clever marketing that brings people in even though they should realize eating seafood in Wisconsin is by definition not local.  Just enjoy the food.    

What didn't I like about the meal:

1- The Carnarolli risotto was off.  It tasted like Chef Boyardee risotto finished with too much balsamic vinegar.  It was cooked perfectly.  
2- Not a big fan of the yellowtail.  When it comes down to it, i just don't love raw fish.

What I liked:
1- Our server was fantastic and knowledgeable
2- The entrees of the beef short ribs and the pork shoulder were good.  But the gnocchi with the short ribs didn't taste great and were crumbly and not al dente. 
4- The presentation was very nice
5- Cocktails were delicious
6- Desert was really good
7- Very romantic and pretty inside.

I really didn't enjoy the starters.  This place prices the entrees well ($16-$19) but gets you with the starters and the drinks.  if we had come in at $40 per person, I would have given this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Madison.  The food is incredibly delicious.  Every bite is PACKED with flavor.  Each dish is beautifully plated with a variety of textures and flavors.  

I highly recommend the whole wheat pappardelle with lamb and the pan-roasted quail.  Both dishes were so amazing my mouth is watering just thinking about how good they were.  I can't wait to come back to Nostrano!"}
{"text":"We had a 5:45 dinner reservation and when we arrived to an empty restaurant and asked to have a drink at the bar (as we have heard wonderful things about the mixologist) and were promptly reminded that there was an 8pm reservation behind us and that we should not take too long. We sat down to our table for 3 and ordered a round of drinks and the Bruschetta, which was wonderful. The three of us each had a different meal, 2 were quite salty (the quail and the oriechette) and the rabbit was bland. When we asked to order dessert at about 7:30 our waitress looked at her watch and again reminded us of the reservation following us. The dessert was delicious, we paid our bill with a marginal 15% on a $200 total and left the restaurant by 7:55. Hopefully the 8 o'clock group felt more welcomed than we did.
