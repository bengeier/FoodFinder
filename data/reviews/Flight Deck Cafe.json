{"text":"The food is good. Your best meal will be breakfast. Be prepared to spend a few extra dollars."}
{"text":"I think it is high time for me to write a review for Coleen and phil's place. I have been a regular for over 10 years, ever since they only did subs and salads at the old fbo.  I enjoy many items on their menu, but my favorites are the New Yorker and the Sentimental Journey.  The New Yorker is a huge rueben sandwich on panini toasted marbled rye.  And the Sentimental is a great hamburger!
The restaurant hours vary by season and a simple call ahead can ensure that they will be open if you are flying in.  When i fly, part of my preflight is to check if the restaurant is open before embarking on a $100 hamburger.  
Gateway airport has the most unique blend of general aviation, corporate, commercial and military aircraft of any airport I know, please stop by and top off your tank!"}
{"text":"Well the food is good. Nothing to special, what makes this place standout is the view of the Phx-Mesa Gateway Airport ramp. If you pick the right time you can see some pretty cool aircaft while you enjoy your lunch. The prices are good for the quality of food you recieve.oh and the restaurant is full of model aircrft hanging from the ceiling."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! You bet I'm going to be a regular now! Flying saucer is my new calling. I'll be here every other day forever! Such great people AND food! Thanks guys!
And if anyone didn't have a 5 star time, please try it again!"}
{"text":"This is our new spot for breakfast!! The buffet was excellent with eggs made to order and the employees are very friendly. I have not tried lunch here yet but I'm sure it is excellent also. I will be coming here whenever I want a good breakfast!"}
{"text":"The location is awesome, i really enjoyed coming here for breakfast because you can get a table practically on the runway. Very cool.  Now the food, well -- its your standard breakfast deal ; nothing too fancy or impressive. It was better the first time I went, took a client here for breakfast one time, and sort of regretted it because it was a bit low class for that type of occasion. The food was OK, staff is very polite and friendly. I just wish the seating was better (booths) and the food could be a bit more imaginative too. Great place to take kids for breakfast / family outing.  I give em three stars, because the food was only OK but perhaps my opinion will change in the future."}
{"text":"Very close to ASU Poly campus where I go to school so we tried this place once with friends. For a Thursday morning, it was fairly near full capacity and busy. I thought the decoration/environment was great. Food was slightly on the expensive side for what it was (paid $8.50 for a midsize cheese steak) but worth it. Menu is rich but waiter didn't check on us after he served the food. They also have weird hours, they close early in the afternoons so had never had a chance to try this place after class."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food was not the best, I had the omelet.  They used canned mushrooms and the egg was not cooked all the way through.  But I will come back and try something else next time.  There are model planes hanging from the ceiling and pictures all over the walls with planes in them.  Which my 1 year old son LOVED!  You can watch the planes out the windows.  So fun!
Staff was great!"}
{"text":"This place is super convenient for me.  I work in the same area as this caf√©.  I call in my order and they have it ready for me within five minutes.  I get the French toast with bacon every time.  They even know that I don't like butter so they won't put it in with my meal.  I've never tried lunch or dinner there but the breakfast gets a 4 star with me. 

Very friendly staff and good food.   A nice place to bring family and watch planes come in or just grab your meal and leave."}
{"text":"The menu items are all cleverly named My triple decker club sandwich, affectionately known as \"xxxx\" was a mile high, while 3/4 of the mile was bread. I recommend getting the fries as a side because they were crispy and tasty. The potato salad was tasty as well, but a small dollop barely constitutes a serving.

What really sets this place apart is the ambience. Decorated by posters and prints of aviation across history as well as small model airplanes hanging from the ceiling. If you're a fan of aviation, young or old, this is one place that should be on your list. Here, the ambience almost outweighs the service and the food. Whereas the food and service were both decent, neither one was very special. You can seat yourself, and if you're lucky, you can snag a table by a window that overlooks the tarmac of the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport. You'll probably see small private planes, but you may catch a glimpse of a couple fighter jets or a larger passenger plane from Allegiant Air."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to grab breakfast. On the weekends (both Saturday & Sunday) they have a breakfast buffet for about $10. It's a pretty awesome buffet that includes eggs to order, bacon, sausage, hash browns, corned beef hash, biscuits & gravy, pancakes (blueberry & plain) with a hint of cinnamon, French toast, bread pudding, yogurt, cereal, fruit, & donuts. There might be more but I can't remember right now. The place is clean, service is good and there's a great view of the airplanes & jets taking off & landing. There are also many model planes hanging which are pretty cool to look at. 

The flight deck cafe is north of the terminal. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. These airport cafes all tend to be very good. I am glad that they remain unfound gems to most. Found is awesome, service is great, and prices are not bad."}
{"text":"I'm not often to write poor views, but this one irks me. I've FLOWN IN no less than 3 times to have breakfast at this restaurant and it was closed. What airport greasy spoon restaurant is closed on Sunday morning? When we went in and asked why they were closed, I was told, \"It's slow around here, and he wasn't making money.\" Did he expect Obama to come in and bail him out, or stimulate his business while it was closed? Seriously. Just a hint, here, Mr. Business Owner, but you can't make money if your doors aren't open. 

We've instead flown over to the restaurant at Chandler where it is ALWAYS busy, and there was even a wait on the Sunday morning I went. 

Put out a good product, for a reasonable price, with good service, and you'll make money, and you won't be slow. Not only will you get me in the door once, but you may even find me in there regularly. 

I think I'll fly up to Sedona where I know they'll be open for 3 meals a day, 7 days a week."}
{"text":"I have been going here on and off for a few years now. I am not a fan of the breakfast buffet. just seems like the food is very bland. However, I do like the burgers. I have had  a problem with needing to get up and get my own refills. I like the atmosphere. There is one kid that waits on the people that I think he should stay in the back. He seems to be an idiot. I have had a very nice lady wait on me once and she was wonderful. My last time in I had a tall young man help us. He seems very nice and well mannered. If he was wating tables all the time, then maybe I would come in more often."}
{"text":"had a saturday morning brunch there with my kids who got to watch the planes take off and land. it is a neat novelty and the food is good, but not great. service also good but not great. Interesting spot worth trying, but not sure it's worth revisiting."}
{"text":"Had breakfast buffet there on Sunday morning.  It was really good for the price of only $10.00.  Friendly, helpful staff.  The bread pudding was really good.  I have seen reviews complaining about the prices.  I thought the prices were great.  Go to another airport and try to pay what you are paying there.  NOT.  The place was really clean also."}
{"text":"This place is always a family favorite! The weekend breakfast buffet is great, and refilled quickly as needed. It's nothing fancy. Just plain good breakfast food! The service is friendly, cheerful, and attentive. 
The location is great... Tucked away, and slightly off the beaten path. It's a great place for kids with all the airplanes hanging from the ceiling, and the big grassy area just outside! 
Many weekends there are flight of military aircraft parked right outside. Which is always cool!"}
{"text":"Had Sunday breakfast here with my family and three of her BFFs from her b-day sleepover. The buffet was simple with limited choices but the food was really good. They had the basics for breakfast food: Eggs, bacon, sausages, hash browns, fruit, cereal, pancakes, you get the picture...all you can eat.

The pancakes were great. I'm not a corned beef fan, but I'll eat it here. The staff was down to earth friendly and for some reason I can't explain, the atmosphere gave me that \"mid-western, eating at my favorite Aunt's house\" feel to it.

Model planes hanging everywhere, I sat under a \"Bone\" (B-1 bomber). Six people well-fed with some good cookin' for under sixty bucks. Can't go wrong. I'd like to try a burger here sometime, if it's anything like their breakfast, it will be friggin' good."}
{"text":"I had a very good breakfast burrito here this am breakfast. Great service too. They had a buffet but was not what I was searching. It looked ok. Not great though."}
{"text":"CLOSED - sadly. Never been disappointed. Great place to take a family to watch planes and eat a quality meal. Recently missed the breakfast buffet and glad we did. Lunch menu is great!"}
{"text":"Such a great little spot. You not only can look out the windows and watch planes, commercial, private, and even some time old planes and military jets. The food is great as well as the service. I work in walking distance from the cafe and love to come walk over for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I swear I have left 900 reviews for this place!? I guess not!? What happened lol!? LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The family staff is so friendly, attentive and great at what they do! There hasn't been 1 time I have gone here and been dissapointed. Its a cute life cafe outside the Williams Gateway airport. You can sit inside and watch planes come and go, super neat! They have great aviator decor, great relaxed atmosphere, nice and clean, easy going kind of place. If you stop by come for breakfast! Their hint of cinnamon pancakes are delicious (way better than ihop!) They also have a very affordable breakfast buffets on the weekends.

Flightdeck - You are the reason I am fat! LOL! Your food is way too delicious to throw away, clear my plate every time, no matter what I order! Keep it up! :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for this place from the main airport lobby, you need to exit and go 2 or 3 buildings north (past the car rentals, past the lawn). Cafe name is prominent on the building at the entrance."}
{"text":"I have called and left four messages over several dates with this establishment asking for a detailed receipt for a credit card receipt. I've yet to get a telephone call back. If anyone knows of a telephone number that I could actually reach a human there - please let me know."}
{"text":"Pros: Staff friendly and helpful and view can be good. Cons: everything on table was sticky with food. Including menus. Just creeped me out. Food was ok."}
{"text":"My kids love this breakfast buffet. They can eat as much bacon as they want and they can watch the planes taking off too. Very reasonable prices."}
