{"text":"Good food! Sometimes its a little off, but when its on its Gangsta!"}
{"text":"The food here is decent but the customer service is terrible! My husband and I drove 20 minutes to pick up food for a large group of family we had over. When we got home, we discovered it was the wrong order. When I called to notify them of the mistake, the owner refused to remake the correct order. She told us that what we got was a better deal than what we actually paid for. When I informed her that our family does not eat beef which is what the incorrect order was, she apologized but still refused saying that she would lose money. Well she certainly ended up losing something...our business along with others I'm hoping! Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Always good .some times better then others,but compared to other places this is my first choice.the hot sour soup is best.portions are very large and prices are average.the atmosphere  is not best but who cares you are there to eat."}
{"text":"Wah Sun is a most definitely a hidden gem. I prefer their food to Hunan and you get a lot for your money. My parents used to take my sister and I to Wah Sun every Friday night before TGIF. Good memories and great food.  Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Miss the old Wah Sun- this one is just ok.  They have a pretty decent eggroll and big portions but kind of your typical chinese restaurant. Prices aren't bad. I always like it going down but then feel painfully full after eating it.  I wish they offered brown rice."}
{"text":"I live about 20 min away from Wah Sun and had heard good things so we ordered take out last night and ate in.  I don't expect much from Chinese food, it's usually all pretty much the same.  Well,  I hope they were just having an off night, because the food we had was very poor quality, bland and overcooked.    I ordered the assorted appetizer and the pot stickers were deep fried, not steamed or pan seared and the chicken satay was leathery and overcooked.  I didn't finish my entree of cashew chicken because it was not good at all.  It looked and tasted like they used a saucepan instead of a hot wok to cook it.  It was only my first time there, but I won't be going back since there are better options for chinese around."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants, especially for lunch.  There is no alcohol but the food is delicious and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I really like wah sun. The food is good and the people that work there are very friendly. I don't think I would eat there the place could use an update. But the food is good for the price."}
{"text":"It had been 20 years since the last time I was in Chesterland and the last time I had visited Wah Sun.  So -- after a 20 year absence I was hoping that Wah Sun was as good as I remembered.  IT WAS.  We stopped here during the early afternoon (after the normal lunch rush) on a weekday afternoon.  Considering the time of day, I was surprised that the restaurant was still busy and that we weren't the only ones enjoying a late weekday lunch.  The food was as good as I remembered and the service was very good. The staff was quite pleasant and very efficient.  As several other reviewers have commented -- this is truly a hidden gem - you have to know where to look and even then you might miss it.    Good place for a good meal with good service at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I love Wahsun! Chesterland is lucky to have it.  I live in Colorado now and definitely miss having a solid Chinese restaurant option."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Geauga County. Good people  great service. The wonton soup is outstanding."}
{"text":"Don't be scared off by the actual look for the place. I'll admit it's down right sketchy looking. My guy LOVES it but I could take it or leave it. I will tell you the owner is amazing!!! One time my cc didn't work and she let me take the food and call once I got home. It was so nice that she trusted me. Their Rangoon's are amazing, as well as the spring rolls."}
{"text":"Loved it! Hidden gem! And when I say hidden, I mean - I had no idea this place existed till one of the locals told me about it.  Their wonton soup is really good! the rest of the menu isn't bad either; but also not the best chinese food I've ever had.  They're friendly, quick, and efficient."}
