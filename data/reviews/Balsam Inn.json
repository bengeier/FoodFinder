{"text":"Best service ever! Just had a few drinks at the bar, but staff was great! Tiramisu was excellent!! Enjoy!!!d"}
{"text":"I've been to Tavern Square Dominion many times and I've always had a great experience. Balsam Inn, on the other hand, was disappointing. 

I ordered a soup of the day, which was bland and salty, and the penne à la Norma. It was an odd combination of eggplant and tomatoes, the sauce was oily and the dish was pretty unflavorful. 

The only redeeming quality of the place is the decor and service."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. Kind of overpriced. Cocktails are tasty and the pasta dishes are beautifully cooked. The place is gorgeous as well. Will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited the Balsam before a hockey game. Fantastic decor, ambiance and great food. Must try the flat bread and the pappardelle pasta."}
{"text":"Bel endroit pour prendre un verre, prix raisonnables et belle sélection de cocktail parcontre y manger est une autre histoire... En fait, je pense que le fait de payer 2$ pour le minuscule bol d' huile qu' on m' a servi pour y tremper mon pain plat m' est resté au travers de la gorge. Le reste de la carte est très ordinaire pour des prix exorbitants. Dommage. Je vous conseille la porte à côté, le Dominion Square Tavern, établissement tenu par les mêmes propriétaires. Clairement, outre la magnifique déco, le Balsam témoigne d' un grand manque de vision culinaire..."}
{"text":"Conveniently located downtown, Balsam Inn has everything to please. We went on a busy Friday night with a reservation for 6 people. When we got there, the place was already full and very loud. The interior is delightfully decorated and the whole place is lighted with candles which creates a very intimate setting.  Our waiter was very friendly and took his time answering the dozen of questions we had for him. 

One of their specialties is called the flat bread and is made directly in front of you at the back of the restaurant. The best way to describe it is a very flat pita. It is best eaten with other dishes.

We also tried out their hunter sauce pappardelle which was excellent, their beef tartare which lacked flavour but came in a very generous portion, their white anchovies and egg Cesar salad, and their smoked herring and potato salad. Both salads were delicious but forgettable.

Overall, the price is affordable, the staff is friendly, and the food is good but not memorable. 3/5

Special note: go check out the bathroom!"}
{"text":"Un des rares endroits absolument charismatique au centre-ville ! La nourriture est bonne sans toutefois être dans mes tops. On y va pour leur pain plat maison, l'atmosphère et un bon verre de vin.

* Attention: fermé le lundi !"}
{"text":"Nous sommes des habitués de la Taverne juste à côté, mais nous adorons le Balsam aussi en raison de cocktails, du bon pain plat dans le four à bois et de la qualité du service (surtout quand on s'assoit au bar, on le recommande chaudement!!)"}
{"text":"Had a lovely experience here with tremendous service at a very reasonable price. The ambiance is dark, warm and friendly. I had the Lamb Sirloin and Zaatar ($22).  It was perfectly cooked and served with a surprising and tasty zucchini salad. My GF had the Porc Osso Buco with rosemary polenta ($21) and loved it. Their delicious appetizer flatbreads are formed, rolled and baked at a station near the bar that features a wood-fired oven. I highly recommend getting one and spending the extra toonie for the oil and apple vinegar accompaniment. The artisan apple vinegar is locally produced and adds amazing levels of complexity."}
{"text":"Go for the drinks, NOT the food. This is one place in Montreal I've been to that I would not recommend for dining. 
I ordered the tomato flatbread. It was basically toasted pita bread with roasted tomatoes on it. It could have definitely used some garlic & fresh basil. 
I also ordered what I thought was grilled calamari with herbs. Instead it was grilled calamari with some sort of root vegetable (fennel?) salad & a heavy cream dressing. The calamari did not smell or taste fresh. The waiter told me it was delivered that day & did little else to ease my suspicion."}
{"text":"Decor 5/5 food 4/5 staff&service 4/5
The food was delicious, the service was quick and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Love the french pub vibe!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. We reserved a table for a birthday celebration but were crammed into a tiny table next to the kitchen. Then we sat for 15 minutes without even having our drink order taken. I will never go to the Balsam again."}
{"text":"Service was as good as it gets. The restrooms are worth a visit by themselves. The food was ok. I'd say, a great place to have a drink with a good snack menu but a lackluster restaurant."}
{"text":"Perhaps I was lucky to get them on a good night, but it was my first time here and absolutely loved it from start to finish.

We came a little early about 15 mins before 7pm on a Saturday night without reservations for two people and settled at the bar, which is always much more interesting. We started off with their on tap cider, and we're big cider fans, and it was delicious. The bartender lady was friendly and didn't have any trouble ordering our food. We had the salmon and beef tartare, with a cream of cauliflower w/ bacon soup entree. All 3 dishes were delicious. I typically don't like dill in my salmon tartare, but it was tastefully balanced and truffle oil was used sparingly - just enough to give it a smooth taste than an overwhelming one. Enjoyed the cider so much we ordered a second round of drinks. We stayed for about 2 hours and watched the place fill up. 

I much prefer this place than next door's Dominion Square Tavern as it's always crazy busy. Here the atmosphere is a bit more relaxed, not pretentious at all and loved the refurbished vintage decor, the great original tile work in the bathrooms and vintage stall doors. 

There are very few places I thought worthy to eat in Downtown Montreal, but by far this is my favorite. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Like Dominion Tavern next door, Balsam Inn has done a great reno and is one of downtown's most stylish eating options away from the chain restaurants. I haven't eaten much here but what I have tastes - the fried chicken - was good. 

My lousy reviews is generally due to poor service. Our main course arrived before our drink order - two glasses of wine, nothing tricky - and I could only cringe as I watched the waiter repeatedly bring each table the food first, then have to return inside to fetch cutlery - at least 4 times! 

My review would have been 3-stars until the waiter knocked my wife in the back of the head as he walked by with the water jug! Very sloppy service."}
{"text":"Fried chicken and the cucumber salad were great! Oh, and the little pot of melted cheese with the fresh flat bread was fantastic.
Really nice spot and the staff was great."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and enjoyed a lovely quiet dinner here. The service was friendly and attentive. The waitress changed a drink we did not like. The pasta was delicious -- we had penne with eggplant and tagliatelle with prosciutto . Rocket salad starter was dressed perfectly. Garlic bread was generous and so tasty. We resisted ordering more. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a chill, romantic dinner or for a fun catch-up with friends. The interior is dark and cosy, which feels pretty inviting and comfortable. It looks a lot like it's brother, Dominion, but as others mentioned, not as crowded. I actually think I like Balsam Inn better in terms of food and cocktail choices. In general, the food is not remarkable, and that's okay. An exception goes for their fried chicken and tiramisu.  Both were among the best I've had. The chicken was a little sweet, super tender and juicy :P The tiramisu was just really well done. Also, as a plus - they have a lot of whiskey based cocktails. 

I rarely go to the same restaurant twice in MtL, because this lovely city boasts many enticing options, but I'll come back here many times in the future. There are not many places like this is downtown."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and had the chicken pappardelle and the salmon tartare. Both dishes were delicious. Our server was friendly and the food came out quickly. We sat outside and they were nice enough to warn that it was windy. This place does not have a lunch menu so it was a bit pricey for lunch. There is no parking lot so you have to find parking which will add to the cost."}
{"text":"This place looks awesome, the atmosphere is great and the kitchen in full view is top notch. The plates are on the small side, but I like that (usually too much food on the plate). And the food was great, except for that odd chorizo bread thing. Okay, the Fried Chicken isn't Montreal's best, but it's damn good and definitely NOT dry. The service was excellent too."}
{"text":"Balsam Inn is a restaurant, I've been meaning to try for quite sometime. Having read so many wonderful reviews, a outstanding review on The Gazette as well, and most of all the menu stood out for being simply delicious. 

Now from my point of view being there for lunch, I truly loved it! In almost every aspect. Which I will go into details about. There was one big drawback, which I will explain in a bit. 
We began by placing our order for the appetizer and main dishes all at once. Only one of us ordered an appetizer, which was a Caesar salad prepared to perfection! Crispy, cold, fresh Romaine lettuce, gently coated with a light but very tasty house made dressing, a perfect crunch to every single crouton and a salty bite of fresh Parmesan shavings. Lastly sprinkled with small but generous amount of homemade bacon bits.  Portion size was perfect as well. 

As our main dishes. We ordered the pork Osso Bucco, an the Charcuterie platter, which is a descent size to share for two. The platter consisted of the following: House made ricotta, House made salami, their wood fire oven flat bread, arugula, a tangy/sweet tomato relish, a lovely aged cheddar cheese, entire types of olives, roasted eggplant, zucchini, and fennel. All  this finished by a very light dressing of balsamic vinegar. Superb each and every bite!
*Note! (This is where they loose points for me) Our meals, which were only two dishes, arrived 40 minutes later. Sadly, our waitress did not advice us at all of any delays, nor apologized. 
Yes, the restaurant was packed, yet.. I think 40 minutes completely unacceptable! 
After 40 minutes of us very patiently waiting, I approach our waitress to ask,\"How much longer must we wait?!\" She was polite in stating that our dishes will be arriving in five minutes. Which they did. After the long wait. 

As for desserts: We ordered one Tiramisu, and a fresh cherry(Available in season only) puff pastry tart, with a delicate scoop of almond flavouried ice cream. Both desserts were excellent! The tiramisu was creamy, descent amount of coffee, a good taste of the real Mascarpone, and rich. Again, outstanding!

In terms of the service and ambiance. As I walked in, I fell in love with the decor. It's a good mixture of vintage, with elegance, but casual at the same time. No need to dress fancy. The chairs were quite comfortable, the tables are a good size, and the bar is absolutely beautiful. In fact, every touch of this restaurant from the wood fire oven to their bathroom is unique and again beautiful. 

Our waitress was incredibly professional and friendly. She began by speaking very clear about the lunch specials, asking each question very politely but always adding a tiny touch of laughter and humor. Which was the right touch! 

Overall, I would highly recommend The Balsam Inn. The food, the ambiance, the service was perfection that it made me completely forget about the long wait for our main dishes. Having said that, if you are limited on time, or can't risk a long wait. Sadly, I would recommend to think twice if you'd like to try The Balsam Inn."}
{"text":"Great Italian place in downtown Montreal. We started with the Roquette salad - light and refreshing greens shaved parm and a roasted shallot dressing. The dressing was genius and it's on my to do list of things to recreate at home. 

For mains, I had the Alfredo, which was probably the best rendition I've had to date. The sauce was somehow both rich and light, and coupled with crispy pancetta the whole dish was to die for. I batted boyfriends fork away several times before I licked my plate clean. He had the special (turkey confit with potatoes and paprika aioli) and it was phenomenal. 

Finally - dessert. We opted for the vanilla creamaux which came with strawberry jam and a crumble on top. The creamaux was amazingly fluffy and light and the strawberry jam and crumble just pulled the whole thing together. I regret sharing just a little bit, I definitely could've eaten the whole thing myself."}
{"text":"Super décor, l'experience aux toilettes vaut le détour. (Le savon ) Comme les autres disent on ne se sent pas au centre-ville. thank god! La bouffe est bien, similaire à la Taverne et dans les mêmes prix. Côté cocktail, aussi bien qu'au Baldwin. Finalement j'ai essayé le midi et le soir, j'ai préféré la crowd du soir et j'ai trouvé le choix limité et assez cher pour le midi. Il existe de meilleures options à moindre prix dans de meilleurs restos. Mais certainement un spot a considérer après le travail ou en début de soirée."}
{"text":"Incredibly close to its sister restaurant Taverne Dominion Square and also has a fairly similar vibe. 

The cocktails were very tasty and you will be in heaven if you're into Aperol Spritz type drinks. The melted cheese with homemade flatbread was a sure hit, and the arancinis were a home run: the right amount of filling, sauce, and crispness. 

Make sure to ask about the daily specials since they are a well kept (and delicious) secret."}
{"text":"Before I tell you how much I loved this place, let me say: THEY CANNOT HAVE ANYONE UNDER 18 IN THE RESTAURANT/BAR. We brought our 13 year old with us and had to sit outside (cool July evening so it was fine). Just know you have been advised.

The food was so delicious (order several items and share, the servings are perfect size) and the service fast and friendly. Price was great and we could not have been happier!

One last thing, order the homemade lavender lemonade, seriously delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice, high end restaurant with a wood burning fireplace. I had the fried chicken and it was great, then I ate the tiramisu ice cream, which was awesome!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended as a \"French Bistro.\"  The menu was rather limited and appeared to have more pasta inspired dishes.  I had the Caesar Salad and my parents had pasta dishes.  The food was average and the service was very slow.  I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Much like dominion tavern the drink prices are expensive and portions are small but the food was good. I think it's worth trying out if you'd like to order a few plates and share among friends. I wouldn't expect the best Italian out there but it's worth a try."}
{"text":"For people who work downtown, this is a great place to end the day with a cocktail or dinner. We've walked in off the street four or five times, and they've never had any problem accommodating us without a reservation. The staff is friendly and efficient; they come by often to top up wine glasses and make sure that you have everything you need. The menu is Italian-inspired. The meatballs with toasted pine nuts are outstanding, as is the cannelloni (whoever is making their tomato sauce knows what they are doing---it's perfectly balanced, not overly seasoned or acidic). Their cocktail list is good too; they are one of the few places I've been to that stocks Crodino, which I like. All in all, you cannot go wrong here, or at Balsam's sister restaurant, the Dominion Tavern, which is right next door."}
{"text":"Super cute spot to catch lunch:
*artisan cocktails 
*pour over coffee 
*professional, hip staff
*hooks under the bar
*made to order food with quality ingredients 

Check out the bathrooms.  LOVE.  So great a fellow tourist went all the back to her bag just to get her camera to snap a pic."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place: great cocktails, wonderful decor/ambiance (a sort of old-fashioned feel, with elegantly old-school bathrooms and lovely powdered soap), and the food is really, really good. It's light, small to medium portions (we had the tapas and salad-style plates, but the main courses might be more generous), and varied enough without being weird. An enjoyable place for a date or friend hangout - just make sure to get there far enough in advance, since it was packed on a Friday night (understandably). Fancy and upscale yet social and unpretentious."}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about this restaurant. You can't go wrong with anything the Dominion Square family launches.
Delicious food, great ambience, very attentive and accommodating staff.

Hassle-free online reservations: I had placed one reservation online, and another couple added themselves to our evening, so the staff was kind enough to merge both reservations and place our tables together. 

Service was quick and appetizer versus main courses were well timed apart.
Everyone was very pleased with their meals. Absolutely delicious.
I will definitely be returning again in the near future, and more regularly."}
{"text":"I read about good flat bread, so I just chose this place.  Well.. this isn't a full restaurant. I would rather call it, wine bar where you can get some nibbles. 

Simple plain flat bread is 4 CAD (additional 2 CAD for oil!!!).  I was recommended for tuscany pasta (pepe) which was a simple home-made pasta with parmasan/salami oil(fat). It was ok and if you can't go to Tuscany to try it, go ahead.  Very small menu... 

Good place for a date night that you don't need full dinner."}
{"text":"Came for a nice after work / workout drink / fido was really close so why not stop by lol. The place was dead and that's just how we like it. Loads of attention and quick service. Big bright beautiful restaurant with loads of seating. As my fav place to have an old fashion is at their bar right next door dominion square tavern I knew they would make excellent drinks.

Started with two glasses of wine which was a bit funky tasting so our waiter tasted it and said you're right and gave us another wasn't sure the name but it tasted a lot more fresh so I was pleased.

We shared the antipasto plate which was the perfect amount for two. The pickled vegetables were a great touch but the cheese tho.. DROOL WORTHY! Very tasty. They give you warm bread with olive oil on it and if u finish it and want more it's a $2 charge unless you take slices white bread with olive oil on the side which is what I did because I wanted to switch things up.

After our meal we got a old fashion & negroni both were made with love and fantastic. I went to the bathroom and as I was coming up the stairs I could hear him making my drink I knew he nailed it and he did.

Before we left we had two margaritas with no salt they were good as well. They are served over ice in a small glass not slushy. It was good.

I had a perfect view of the snow falling this afternoon through the big windows, nothing but snowflakes just the way I like it. This place has a great cozy vibe I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant !

L'ambiance est très sympa, la nourriture d'une qualité exemplaire, les serveurs extrêmement gentils, le seul bémol sont les prix, un peu cher mais c'est le prix pour une telle qualité !

Je recommande !"}
{"text":"This new gem in the downtown core is an amazing new Italian bar/restaurant. They opened on Halloween 2014, so it's still brand new, but feels like it's been around for a while. The dark wood, the long bar and the wood fire oven give this place a charm I can't resist. The cocktails and the food are delicious, and the ambiance & lighting make it a perfect date spot! I was really impressed and I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I've been curious about this place for awhile; Balsam Inn's beautiful wooden façade is easily noticable in a city full of concrete, and its name is so poetic! I went there for dinner last week to catch up with a friend, and we had a great time. 
I was basked in a warm glow as soon as I stepped in. The place is chic but cozy, with attractive wooden walls and rich leather benches. The kitchen can be seen through a glass wall in the back. We sat down and chatted for a bit over a drink. I had a Crodino, which came in its original little bottle, next to a glass of gin with ice and orange peel. I ordered the \"Papardelle Sauce Chasseur\" and my friend got the cavatelli. The food was nicely presented, and tasted delicious. The papardelle was topped with crispy chicken skin (a little bit salty) that complimented the soft texture of the pasta. The sauce was rich, with a pleasant acidity. Perfect comfort food! We ended the meal with a dessert, which was tiramisu for her and orange cake for me. The cake was really good - it was dense and warm, which allowed the orange fragrance to really come through. The ball of ice cream on top contained candied ginger, which went well with the cake. 

As we left, I was surprised to see that many people in the restaurant were dressed pretty chic (dress shirt and pants). I suddenly felt a bit underdressed haha"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of checking out this restaurant this week and I found it reasonably priced, good quality food and we had great service too! 

They are really starting strong and I hope they keep it up! The restaurant was really full, on a Tuesday evening, and I didn't find the kitchen slow and everything we ordered was amazing. 

We ordered the fried chicken, seasonal veggies, calamari, stuff pasta with squash, an assortment of cakes, jumbo shrimps and more. We all enjoyed the meal immensely. 

This place is only for 18+ because it's also a bar. As well I loved the washroom for its powdered soap and old English pull toilets and hidden hand dryer. Most importantly it was really clean!"}
{"text":"Overall, I really enjoyed the Balsam Inn. Food was interesting and delicious, the place was really nicely decorated, and the service was great. My only gripe is that the portion sizes are small. If you are really hungry expect to pay a little more."}
{"text":"Made a reservation here for 3 for a friend's birthday and it was all in all a great experience. We sat on a big red leather banquette in the back next to the wood oven, with a great view of the comfortable, vintage, elegant room. The service was friendly, helpful and attentive and the cocktails and wine we ordered by the glass were all excellent. And the food made us hugely happy, I loved the mushroom flatbread, and the meatballs were big and nutty and perfectly moist and generally perfect. The spinach salad was simple and fresh and great for sharing, and the orecchiette with pancetta and fresh peas was so good I'm still thinking about it. I was super happy with my dessert too - a whipped nougat ice cream on crispy lovely buttery almond cookies, really kind of surprising and great. With 5 shared plates, desserts, and 3 drinks each the bill came to $70 each, so definitely not an inexpensive meal but I loved what I ate and the overall experience so I felt like it was perfect for special event. Really glad to have more quality options downtown!!"}
{"text":"Why hasn't any one mentioned the absolutely beautiful bartender?! 
I digress... The food at Balsam is American with a splash of French Canadian surprise. We were there for lunch and found the salads to be pretty good. Next to us were mostly professionals in for their lunch break - which honestly gave a busy bustling feeling to the space."}
{"text":"Zero stars if I can give it. They screwed up a reservation and a group of 8 had no where to go."}
{"text":"I wouldn't really call this an Italian restaurant it's more like a wine bar with a limited appetizer and entree menu. I choose this place base on their Yelp reviews. It's not the type of place you have to get all dressed up for; it's a casual vibe. The food was excellent; we enjoyed their Tomato soup which was the soup of the day. Flat bread with Kale and Feta was ok didn't blow me away. For our entree we went with the Hunter sauce Pappardelle and it was absolutely delicious. They had a pretty good wine selection which is a plus. We came here late and way past the dinner rush so there was no wait for a seat outside. The service was fast and we had a very pleasant server. Balsam Inn is a place I would hang out at if I wanted to enjoy a couple of glasses of wine and have something to nibble on."}
{"text":"Mon copain et moi, qui avions déjà essayé la taverne dominion (leur grande soeur) juste à côté, nous avons voulu essayer Balsam le temps d'un 5a7. Nous avons essayé les calamars, le pain ainsi qumune petite trempette. Nous avons également commandé un gin tonic (tonic maison) et un spritz. 
Points positifs : 
- la qualité des ingrédiens est impeccable 
- le service est poli et très professionnel 
- très bel endroit, ambiance parfaite pour un 5a7 

Points négatifs :
- le pain n'en vaut pas la peine, il s'agit d'un pain naann point barre . 
- les assiettes sont petites pour des prix très élevés 
- je n'ai pas aimé le tonic maison, qui était très anicé. Mais bon, il s'agit d'un goût personnel !"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and the place is quite nice just like the Dominion Tavern which is right next door. 

Went for the table d'hôte which consisted of a tuna and lobster bow tie pasta and a choice of soup or salad. It started off well as the soup was quite nice so I had high expectation about the main course.  Pasta came and first thought was the plate was quite small for a $21 table d'hôte. The taste was alright but nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Balsam Inn is located just next to Dominion Square Tavern and it is so obvious it is owned by the same people. The restaurant is like the little sister of DST, hasn't reached her class yet, but full of potential.

The cocktails are amazing. Managed to sip from five and they were all very delicious. My favourites for the night whiskey splash and the balsam one.

Food is good, the menu offers really nice choices. Some dishes may be considered of small size, but this is warning if you are really hungry, I personally was satisfied. We shared a flat bread with sun dried tomatoes and I really enjoyed it. My main dish was the confit of white tuna. Very nice combination between the salty fish and the sweetness of the veggies garnished with white raisins. My friend had the home made cavatelli, I was worried that her dish looked kind of small, but she claimed the pasta sauce is creamy and filling. 

The service was great and our host knew very well the menu, he was able to give us good recommendations on cocktails and dishes. Other then that, the music is chill, not the same as in DST, but almost, the bathrooms have the same cool design. I'm happy with my visit and I would say that Balsam Inn is a plan B if the place next door is packed or plan A if you are in need for something a little different."}
{"text":"The serving sizes are \"European\", and it's a good thing because the dishes are wonderfully rich, expanding in your mouth, not your stomach. I had the calamari for my entrée, I think it's the best I've had in my life. The osso buco (pork) almost melted. And the orange cake relieved the weight of the two preceeding courses, rather than oppressing them as desserts unfortunately often do. For apéritif, kir cassis prepared and served perfectly. The Crozes hermitage we had with our meal was as full-bodied as the food. Definitely worth visiting again."}
{"text":"I took the Ravioli main platter.....6 pieces that's it?!?!? Very disappointed for 19$..... If this was for 10$ no problem. But come on!!!! I wouldn't suggest this place at all. Especially if you are hungry."}
{"text":"Première expérience au Balsam inn et ce ne sera certainement pas la dernière. Délicieux petit restaurant italien localisé sur la rue Metcalfe juste à côté de la Taverne Square Dominion du même propriétaire. Nous avons été agréablement accueillis dans un cadre feutré et intime. Installés sur une banquette confortable avec une bougie au centre de la table, l'atmosphère idéal pour une soirée en amoureux. La serveuse très charmante nous a suggéré de quoi débuter en boisson. Je ne voulais pas d'alcool donc j'ai pris à sa recommandation la limonade à la lavande, vraiment très bonne! Mon ami a pris un cocktail maison mais qu'il a trouvé trop fort. La serveuse lui en a gentiment proposé un autre sans frais. En entrée nous avons débuté avec la mozza du Québec et tomates: 3 choix de tomates (rouges, vertes et jaunes savoureuses et juteuses) avec une sauce balsamique épaisse assaisonné de gros sel. Un vrai délice! Puis, les calamars qui étaient savoureux avec une purée de hummus (si je ne me trompe pas). Les calamars étaient cuits à la perfection, pas caoutchouteux. Comme plat principal j'ai pris le tartare de saumon accompagné de frites. Le tartare était savoureux, parfaitement assaisonné avec des concombres marinés sur le dessus et pour les frites rien à dire. Mon copain a pris le T bone sur beans, il l'a trouvé très bon. Pour ce qui est du dessert mon cake à l'orange était juste WOW, moelleux et goûteux avec une délicieuse boule de crème glacée. Le blondie qui est en fait un brownie au chocolat blanc avait tout pour être un pur délice mais la sauce caramel au beurre salé s'est averée beaucoup trop salée. La serveuse a pris le temps d'en informer la cuisine.
Bref, une adresse que je recommande fortement pour un souper tout en finesse et plein de saveur et pour un service attentionné et authentique."}
{"text":"This place never fails. Over the course of many years, I have dined many of times and each meal has been scrumptious. I say with confidence, this place has by far the best bangers and mash in the town. The bangers (sausages) are change every week if i'm not mistaken and they are made fresh at the restaurant. Reservations are highly recommended on the weekends. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I recently tried balsam in for the first time for lunch with coworkers. We made a reservation for 7people and they had our table ready immediately. We got great service , including a great wine recommendation and really enjoyed the casual chic ambience inside (outdoor seating also available).  The prices are fair and our food was fresh and well prepared and presented. Great lunch or dinner spot with a group or one on one, where you can have a nice meal in a nice setting without breaking the bank (lunch and dinner specials are also offered and change all the time) Most of us opted for pasta dishes and one of us got the tuna tartare - we were all very happy with our food and our vegetarian coworker was also happy with the menu and her meal."}
{"text":"Pas mal. Mais rien d'inoubliable non plus. D'abord, le serveur nous vante le naan maison sans retenue. Nous nous attendions donc à une révélation. L'ange Gabriel n'était toutefois pas au rendez-vous. Le pain était bon mais de là se fracasser le crâne sur le coin de la table... Et il en va tout autant pour l'agneau au zaatar que j'ai commandé. Deux petites côtelettes accompagnées d'une salade quelconque. Le sel prédominait dans la préparation du zaatar. La viande était tiède-froide. Le poulet frit de ma convive était goûteux mais avait le défaut d'autres poulets frits de d'autres bons restos: trop graisseux et trop grillé. Il y a plein de bonne volonté dans ce Balsam Inn mais il faut garder en tête que la qualité de la nourriture est dans le top des priorités. L'accueil et le services sont des critères importants mais il faut demeurer rationnel."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting Montréal from NY. On reccomendations from friends this was the first place I  ate at. Ordered an old fashioned which was on point. Met with friends and ordered 5 or so dishes on the menu which were all delicious. Flat breaf was freshly made to order. The fried chicken and the braised pork were my favorites. Wine flowed nicely. Ambiance was relaxing and cozy. Great time all around! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Le meilleur service professionnel reçu jusqu'ici. Staff calme et sympathique. Le meilleur Martini dry à Montreal. Le Balsam est notre \"go to place\" de quartier/5@7 prolongé mon amoureux et moi.

Je suis d'accord avec les avis mitigés de leur pain par contre. Not a big fan myself. J'aime essayer leurs \"plat du jour\" qui ne m'ont jamais déçu. Mon plat coup de cur est l'osso buco de porc, servi sur polenta maison crémeuse arrosée du jus de cuisson. C'est à mon avis à se fracasser la tête oui! 

I rarely eat desert but they have an orange almond flour cake I can't resist.

You also have to know that contrarily to other restaurant WINE BY THE GLASS is not more expansive than buying a bottle. It's pretty cool if you want to try different wine or need that extra glass after the bottle is done.


Leur seul défaut...j'aimerais qu'ils aient au menu des huîtres fraîches! Ca c'est vraiment Perso."}
{"text":"Went for a quick dinner with a friend, thank goodness we made reservations because as soon as we sat down, they were turning customers away because there were no more seats. I had a soup of the day and the hunter sauce papardelle pasta plate. I absolutely loved both. The soup was a carrot with ginger puree drizzled with some green oil and sesame, super tasty, warm and hearty, perfect for the yucky rainy weather today. My pasta was delicious, perfectly al dente, the sauce with mushrooms and bacon hit the spot that was craving something with umami. The menu mentioned Chicken in the pasta but in retrospect, I really didn't detect much chicken.... Hence one less star. Service was great, I wanted hot water because I'm getting over a cold, sometimes waiters don't comprehend but this one brought a steaming teapot with cup and lemon slice over! Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday and I have to admit that the place was so dark that it was a bit spooky. It is in the heart of downtown, next to the Sun Life building and the Dorchester Square. I was having a hard time reading the menu because I was so blind in that darkness, a lot of my friends took their tartares, either beef or salmon, to be honest there weren't too many choices in terms of food, I took a platter of cheese and prosciutto and other goodies, but it was so huge that I had a hard time finishing it. Also the food was too dry so I have to keep drinking. Their wine was okay but nothing super stunning. I think that the food is quite pricey at this place and the taste average, so not very worth it."}

J'y suis allée le lendemain de l'ouverture, le service etait encore un peu hesitant. En tout cas, les cocktails sont bons et originaux, et les petits plats allechants. Une superbe place qui a un cout mais l'ambiance y est franchement agreable (le four à bois ouvert sur la salle est splendide)."}

This is a great comfy casual restaurant with a nice atmosphere. A great place for groups.
They have a great selection of wines by the glass and our waitress was very attentive and friendly. My water glass was kept filled and I liked the waitress' wine suggestion.
The only gripe was the food. I had the salmon tartare which didn't have much flavour other the overwhelming strong flavour of raw onions which was very unfortunate -- I can't taste the dill, lemon or truffle oil because of it. Someone in my party had the steak tartare which also suffered from the overuse of onions with not much other seasoning. I thought the side of fries to the tartare dishes was a bit odd, I would have liked some bread or crostini to have with my tartare. 
As this is supposed to be an Italian restaurant, maybe it's best to stick to their pasta dishes and their more Italian fare."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Montreal, we came here for dinner one night. Our hotel was located on Rue Sherbrooke, only a 10 minute walk to the Balsam Inn. 
We did not have reservations and they were quite welcoming to seat a party of six. One being a baby, to which they were quite accommodating to. Unlike the tavern next door who do not allow children there even though they have an extensive food menu. 
The interior is trendy and rustic. 
The cocktails came quickly and the appetizers were all good ; fresh mozzarella and asparagus, arancini balls, and the Cesar salad. The salad had used a grain mustard as one of the ingredients for the dressing. It was one of the best Cesar salads I have ever had. 
For my entrée, I ordered the pork meatballs. Very good. The other guests were happy with their choices as well."}
{"text":"Petit frère du Taverne Dominion Square, c'est par hasard que mes amies et moi avons passé une soirée là bas, ne trouvant pas de place au Dominion Square justement. Quelle belle surprise, nous avons adoré nos cocktails et les plats étaient délicieux, les desserts un peu en dessous néanmoins.  C'est une excellente alternative à la Taverne, avec déco années folles."}
