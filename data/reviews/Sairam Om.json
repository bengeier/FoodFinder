{"text":"Ate here last week. Ordered samosas, dosa and utappam. The samosas were fresh and hot and exceeded my expectations. The masala dosa was excellent, utappam was okay. The chutneys were great. None of these items were too salty or too oily -- a big plus!

The sambar was somewhat disappointing -- lacking in flavor and too salty. 

Overall, one of the best south indian restaurants that I've been to in the US."}
{"text":"Sairam Om is now my favorite Indian place in town.  While it's a bit of a drive, you get a large amount of very delicious, reasonably priced food with a southern Indian twist. 

highlights:
-great food
-prices about the same as other local indian restaurants
-a lot of food with free rice refills
-far from the center of town"}
{"text":"While the food here is delicious - probably the best I've had in Champaign-Urbana, the kitchen/service is so terrible that the experience is rendered unenjoyable.  I have been to Sairam Om four times over the past few months, but my last visit was totally unacceptable.  On this visit, the restaurant was moderately busy (people were dining at many but not all of the tables).  I was dining with four  friends.  We expected the food to be a bit slow, and it was.  While this was expected and tolerable, the first four dishes came out of the kitchen one dish at a time over the course of approximately 30 minutes.  The final dish (mine) did not arrive after even an additional 30 minutes (despite assurances from the waitress that it was 'coming right out').  This was particularly annoying as one of my dining companions, sitting directly across the table from me, ordered the same dish I did!  After everyone else had finished their food, I told the waitress to simply cancel my order as I was not going to force everyone else to wait for me to eat (if/when it arrived).  To top off the outrage of not receiving an entree, the waitress had the audacity to charge me the $2 and change for my lime juice!  When I requested to speak to a manager about this incident, I was told (on a Friday night at 7:30 PM) that a manger was not available.  It goes without saying that I won't be returning soon as I rather enjoy eating when I dine."}
{"text":"My family is south Indian. I've lived in south India. I think this place is great! I would have given 5 stars if it was closer to campus.

The location is pretty far from campus but well worth the drive (hopefully you have access to a car).  The interior is simple and unassuming but, let's be honest, I'm going there for the food.

I ordered the onion pakkoda (crispy fried onions and spices) as an appetizer and it was amazing!! Exactly how I like it - fresh and crispy. They were also fairly generous with the size of the helping so I was filled with thanksgiving, delight, and delicious food. It also set a good tone for the rest of the meal.

My friend and I ordered some dosas (crispy indian \"pancakes\"). I got a masala dosa and he got an onion dosa and a plain dosa. His dosas seemed very crispy and he really enjoyed them. My dosa was pretty good as well but a little soft on the inside. This is pretty common though since there is food on the inside. The sambar and chutneys (sauces for dosas) were also pretty good.

I thought I'd be adventurous and ordered some parotta (round indian bread). It's a special food I remember eating when I was living in India. When the parotta's came out, I was filled with glee to see that they were exactly as I remembered them. Awesome!

In summary: great food. good price. you should eat there."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the real deal. The food comes in \"levels\" of spiciness and you get to pick your level. Their dishes are diverse and you can add or remove ingredients if you please. 
My tomato rice had a vivid red color, my curry sauce over fish was a bright yellow.  The curry sauce had a tinge of coconut flavor, and the tomato rice was a powerhouse of aroma and flavor. The foods blended together created an ecstasy of savory, exotic tastes. Their samosa appetizer was not only hot and comforting, but literally aromatic, steaming with scents of fenugreek and spices. 
On the side of our table, I spotted a \"did you know\" card about fenugreek. Sairam Om bothered to list a bunch of health benefits this seed provides.
On our way out, after sweating and leaving the plates clean, I noticed the smiling owner encouraged us to crunch some fennel seeds from a bowl, saying \"it's good for your digestion\". He was totally friendly, saying \"sir\" and \"ma'am\".
I don't mean to sound cheesy but I'm dying to return and eat the same plates, just so I can stop dreaming about how tasty they were."}
{"text":"Finally some interesting food in this town! My husband had the goat khadi and I had the lentil curry described as a delicacy. Both were excellent, but I enjoyed the lentil curry flavor a little more than the goat. Like the other reviews say, it is lighter than most Indian food, but it is still plenty of food. We had leftovers for lunch the next day. The menu says they have beer and wine, but they didn't have a beer and wine list. I'm unsure as to why; might be something with the license. This may eventually be a five-star place in my book, but I need to try it at least 1-2 more times to try more things and determine its consistency."}
{"text":"Finally, CU gets a very good, maybe even excellent, indian restaurant, one that serves southern indian, no less.  I've been twice since they opened, and it's clearly one of the very best Asian restaurants of any kind in town.  Certainly, it's an order of magnitude better than Bombay Grill (on 1st), which while it was initially better than Basmati seems to have become insufferably greasy.

So far, the masala dosa and the okra curry have been my favorites dishes, with the vegetable biryani also being very flavorful.  The mango lassi definitely emphasizes the yogurt over the mango.  Overall, the prices are pretty cheap for CU with dosas at $5-6 and vegetarian entrees at $8.  It's been pretty empty both times I've been, and service and the kitchen has been very fast."}
{"text":"This was my first foray with S. Indian food. My friend is from Pakistan, so I eat his cooking regularly but he said I should try South Indian, too. We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Madras chicken and Fish Malabar. All were excellent, and not too spicy. I would say I am semi-used to spicy food. We also had a Masala Dosa, Chettinad kozhi rasam, and vadai. The soup was actually the spiciest thing I ate. Everything was excellent. Will be back."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Indian food I've had in Champaign.  I had the Chicken Shahi Korma with parotta as an entree and the chicken tikka dosa as an appetizer.

Way too much food for one sitting, but it was delicious.  Definitely going back to expand my horizons."}
{"text":"CLOSED!!  Tried to go for lunch the other day....there are signs for \"the curry house -- coming soon\"."}
{"text":"Good food. Had the Chicken Tikka Masala and Mutton Madras Curry, and enjoyed both dishes. Looking forward to my next visit already!"}
{"text":"The food was appalling.  The lamb in the lam biryani tasted stale and uncooked and the butter chicken had no flavor.  The service was rather pathtic too - no serving spoons unless you ask.  Nothing was done till you asked - that included water in your glass.  And we were the only table in the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"I am excited to come back to this place! My husband and I went a few Fridays ago and split the mysore masala dosa and the chilli onion uthappam. Our items came with delicious lentil soup, which was very enjoyable in combination with the dosa entrees. My husband had a mango lasse that was very reasonable priced considering how good it was, while I had a chai tea that was quite lovely.

My only complaint is that they seem over-saturated with servers at this point. They seem to stand around waiting overzealously for whatever they need to do next. For me, it is a bit irritating when I want to enjoy my food and not be rushed in some process of theirs. However, I think with time the owners will work this out so hopefully this aspect will be improved.

I really enjoy southern Indian food. In my experience, it tends to be a bit lighter than what one might typically see at an Indian restaurant. Some of the items might catch customers off guard, but go for it! This is a really tasty place serving a tasty type of food."}
{"text":"After living in South India for nearly a year when I was ten, my family came back to Champaign Urbana and found that there was no way to get good Indian food here, let alone South Indian. I look forward to trips to Chicago to get a Masala Dosa. 
NOT ANYMORE! I am so thrilled that someone finally opened a South Indian restaurant in this town, this is the most exciting thing to have happened to our town since I'm not sure when.
Not only do they have Dosas, which are priced very well and delicious, but everything else I have tried so far has been flavorful and cooked perfectly.
I have known about this place for a week, and been there 3 times, that's how good.
The waitstaff and management are very friendly. They make you feel very comfortable.
( Disclaimer - I actually reviewed this place on urbanspoon as well, because I couldn't find the page for it on yelp right away and was very excited to review it.)"}
{"text":"I went on a Wednesday evening, so maybe my experience was just because they were having an off night. 

I NEVER send food back - I just find it mortifying. So I sucked it up when my samosas came out still cold in the middle. But when my entree (Paneer Tikka) came out with *maybe* twelve dime-sized pieces of paneer floating all alone in two cups of bland, lukewarm sauce.... After reading all the great reviews, a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!!  I haven't had much Indian food, but my first visit to Sairam Om was a major success.  Service was very very gracious and friendly, and my Chicken Tikka Masala dosa was flavorful and ample in size.  Entrees are around $10-12, but the dosa was only $7.  And mango lassi was a delicious beverage addition!  Visit ASAP!  I know I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"The only other Indian food I've had in Champaign has been Bombay and it's pretty awesome so I had fairly high expectations when coming here.

I will say that initially, it was pretty desolate. We were probably the only table for the first 15 minutes. We were kind of in a hurry which made me nervous because every Indian restaurant I had ever been to usually took a little while. We ordered butter chicken and tikka masala (see pics) and were super surprised to see how quickly it came out.

They didn't have naan which kind of bummed me out, but the bread they did have was definitely awesome and flaky. I ended up enjoying it quite a bit. The portions were also pretty big. We had tons of leftovers when we left and I was super satisfied. Overall, I really loved the food and I'll definitely go back!"}
