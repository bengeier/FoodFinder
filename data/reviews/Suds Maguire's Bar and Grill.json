{"text":"I've been to Suds twice so far. The first time I ordered the pizza which was amazing! The crust was thin and crispy and done just right. Plenty for leftovers! The second time I had the Suds burger. Their burger meat is a special blend created by a butcher just for this restaurant. The service was friendly and our food came quick. We will definitely be back to Suds!"}
{"text":"Good food, laid back atmosphere; nice spot to watch the Cavs. The burgers are really tasty."}
{"text":"Service was good,food was terrible!  Had the perch . It was definitely not lake erie perch! Tasted like old frozen ocean perch that they cleaned out of the freezer from ayear ago,worst fish fry I ever ate in my life! Cole slaw horrible. The perch was fifteen dollars not exactly cheep, overly breaded and dry! Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had a fun night out with friends at Suds! I hadn't been there before and didn't know what to expect since the location is a bit out of the way and I think I've driven past several times without noticing it.  But I was pleasantly surprised. The food is bar food but very tasty. We split the fried smoked provolone skewers and pub pretzels for an appetizer. I'd go back just for those! The beer cheese sauce was amazing. I also had the philly cheese steak which was very yummy but pretty standard. My fries were a bit cold but they tasted fine. They have a great draft and bottle beer list that ranges from traditional to trendy and also includes some local brews (and they offer pitchers as well). The ambiance was fun - it's like a nicer dive bar type feel but with good food and good service and even kid friendly. The music is a bit loud but that's part of the charm. They have skee ball and old fashioned bowling in the back to keep older kids entertained. They had live music the night we were there which was very good.  They also have a points loyalty program that I will look into more the next time we're back. Good crowd, good food, good ambiance."}
{"text":"Had house salad w chicken+3bucks very bland $8total place is to pricey 4 me.also had fish fry very small pieces lots of fries.$10 really? Old suds was way better !!"}
{"text":"I got some wings there which were okay but had to wait for pizza doe to be finished before we could get our food. That was completely okay with us if we didn't have to deal with the very rude bartender. She was outwardly disrespectful and impolite towards customers as if we were her friends. In this day and age, customer service is #1 and it doesn't matter how good the food is, it was ruined. Good luck staying in business."}
{"text":"We walked into Suds Maguire on a whim yesterday around 4:30. We really liked it. I got the fish fry, which came with a good, slightly spicy coleslaw and fries. Lots of food on my plate and it was delicious. The breading was this crunchy fluffy that was cooked just right so the grease didn't soak in. I get heartburn when something is too greasy, and this was not. Hubby got a club sandwich which had a lot of really nice ham and turkey, tomato, and not sure what else. It came with fries as well. He really liked it and couldn't even finish it - took half home. The fries are the really skinny kind, which I prefer.  There were a lot of people there and everyone seemed to be having a good time. I saw across the room a few pizzas that looked to me like the brick-oven style (yay!). I'd try that next. They had good beers on draft - not tons of beers, but good ones.   The servers were friendly as were the customers. We sat at the bar next to a guy who knew the place when it was at a different location a long time ago. It has a sports/bar pub feel to it, which I don't mind at all.  Overall - good food for good value, friendly, upbeat. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because as we arrived the place was getting a little busy and the very nice bartender could have used some help. But they just opened in the past month or so, and are probably still figuring out the right balance of servers on a Friday on Valentines Day."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner and service!! We tried the burgers and they were delicious! Our server Heather was outstanding!!!  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and had great recommendations. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened for an occasional drink and pizza. The pizzas are so freaking good! Love it"}
{"text":"We are regulars..friendly service..food is great..nice sized portions..unique monthly menu specials..mini pitchers of beer are best deal in town"}
{"text":"Went here on a recent Friday with a group from work, for lunch.  Since it's the Lent season I decided to try their fish fry...and I'm glad I did!  The fish was an ocean perch served with a mound of fries and coleslaw on the side.  The fish was lightly battered and had a crisp flaky texture to it (and the tartar sauce was on point). Fries were good, especially soaked in malt vinegar. The coleslaw had a spicy kick to it, and twist i was not expecting but enjoyed nonetheless.  Service was good, but dishes took a fair amount of time to make it to the table.  That being said, everything was hot and fresh so only a minor issue.  Will definitely come back again as we work right down the street, nice to have another option in the \"neighborhood\"."}
{"text":"Good food and beer menu. Nice atmosphere and also has a touch tunes. Patio is nice as well."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, both times having been seated at a table in the back. Beware of noise from the games--basketball and bowling--which was very loud and intrusive, and at times made it hard for our party to hear each other. I can understand parents wanting to come here to eat or drink while the kids are entertained, but those interested in conversation should certainly avoid the three or four tables in the rear."}
{"text":"Decent salads, good sandwiches, but GREAT pizza.  I've gone here 8 or 10 times for lunch / dinner and have never had a bad experience.  Lots of big screen TVs to watch the game, and an acceptable amount of beers on tap from which to choose - coupled with the killer pizza - makes for a nice evening out.  The fresh mozzarella and basil pizza is my favorite.   I will comment that the lunch service can be a bit slow, so this might not be the place if you are in grab-n-go mode."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a grey Saturday. Very pleasantly surprised with the food. We had the pub pretzels to share, and they were very fresh, with a nice beer cheese sauce for sipping. My wife had the Jackie burger, with saut√©ed onions and mushrooms, with baby Swiss. Our friend had the lunch combo, with 1/2 Italian sub and 1/2 Caesar salad. I had the pizza special - a white pizza, with 4 kinds of cheese, oil and fresh garlic. I only ate one piece of the pizza, and the rest came home for later, mostly this was because I devoured the tater tots that came with my wife's burger. They were delicious. Service was good, although it was fairly empty. I could see some of the noise issues some have mentioned I'd it was more crowded - the jukebox plays super loud at times.  Overall, really good food, nice space, and am looking forward to going back again to try something different, like the 50-50 burger or wings."}
{"text":"Went here Friday night at 630 with my wife and baby. Only three groups ahead of us. Took 15 minutes for the guy to write our names on waiting list. Same guy went and cleaned up every table and delivered a pizza to one of tables. At one point there were 30 people waiting and staring at enough empty, cleaned tables to seat everyone. However nobody was seated. Everyone waiting was very frustrated. Waited a total of 35 minutes and decided I would not give my money to this place and left.  Seemed very unorganized and mismanaged. I will say the two other times I went here were a positive experience but Friday was frustrating enough to keep me away for a while."}
{"text":"Went back after a few months on Saturday evening with my wife. We sat at the bar had a few drinks and an appetizer. The bartender was attentive, the nachos were fantastic and we had a good time. The places wasn't very crowded, but we were able to watch the Cavs, talk and really enjoyed ourselves. Back on the right track Suds, well done."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner. They have a nice beer selection, many seasonal beers. Our service was slow and our order was not 100% accurate but the staff was able to fix it right away. The food was good. It's a good option for grabbing a beer and watching the game."}
{"text":"The service was great and fun.... Had the chicken fajita flat bread it was super... My family and I sat on the patio with her dog... Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Good food and inexpensive drinks!  Trivia night is super fun!  We eat here at least twice a month."}
{"text":"Stopped in around 8:30 on a Saturday night and my group of 8 had no problem getting a table since there were only a few others hanging out on the patio at this large place.  The service was good, the prices were good, and the drink selection was good too.  Nothing stood out as unique or spectacular but everything was good."}
{"text":"Duds Maguire if I may say... Dinner time, wasn't real busy. My seat had food on it (good lookin out hostess/buser)! Appetizer: Spinach/artichoke dip had big chunks of cream cheese not melted, obviously microwaved since no sign of browning w/ cold&hot spots. Unfortunately, no big chunks of artichokes though. Celery was chintzy.  She forgot my pretzel bun on chicken burger so had to wait a few minutes for a warmed new one. Lotsa fries! Forgot wife's sour cream / salsa for quesadilla (no biggie) Forgot to take $ off for meatless quesadilla option too, & its pineapple slaw was so spicy we couldn't eat it.  Overall not great but may come back to try their pizza."}
{"text":"Food was average. Got the nachos and the cheese was cold. The service was slow. But the the servers were friendly."}
{"text":"We love suds!   Delicious food, great prices, huge portions... yum! The cheap Charlie burger is my favorite, and we can never not order the crazy tots! It's rare if we have leftovers to bring home... it's that good!! Also, we've never had bad service. I can't begin to describe how refreshing it is to walk into a restaurant where no one has a sour look on their faces, and it seems everyone genuinely enjoys working there (rare, right?!)! I can't recommend suds enough!!"}
{"text":"The place is clean and although the decor is a little all over the place, it's like home with momentos that bring back memories like one of the old bowling machines.   Two of us went in just past lunch time. It was their 3 year anniversary and there were a good amount of people there. We were immediately greeted by one waitress. Our waitress followed up quickly with our drink orders. We ordered the Mighty Mac and the I Don't Give a Crap Burger with Tater Tots (regular) and Onion Rings. Both the burgers and sides were excellent! The pub cheese and sauces were perfect.   We cannot wait to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far, and the food is great!  I've had the Steak Cigars and Ohio Cheddar Skewers as appetizers, and the 50/50 burger, and Porky Pig pizza as entrees.  Everything tasted very good and the service was prompt and friendly.  I'll definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great atmosphere and good service. Suds is always a good choice for a local burger and brew."}
{"text":"Limited menu but consistently good service at reasonable prices. I don't go out of my way to come here but there is nothing objectionable either."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a week or two ago. Ordered a burger that was half pork belly half beef. Terrible. The texture was so firm and tasted like it was blasted in microwave without seasoning. I took one bite. My girlfriend was nice enough to share a wrap with me. Also not great. Fries were good. The waitress asked if I'd like a boxed I declined and said it just wasn't good and not worth taking home. She smiled and explained to me it was half beef and half pork belly. Really... I'm not one to make a scene and she was prego and looked a little beat so I let it go. Just like I'm letting this place go. Not worth a second try."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great addition to the neighborhood! I have been to Suds twice now (one weekday lunch, and one Saturday night) and I have been impressed both times with the quality of service in addition to the quality of the food.  The soup of the day was stellar along with the steak cigars and cheddar skewers apps. Great option for casual dining!"}
{"text":"I was here for a special event that had rented out the entire side room.  Bar was busy and I think just to many people for the staff on hand at that time, but like I said, it was a special event so I understand.  The food was really good.  Honestly, I could have kept eating myself into a coma.  Beer and bar food sometimes just hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Went here for game time and ordered a Philly cheesesteak. Nice game atmosphere and pretty good food. They also have a very wide range of items on their menu which is good if you are a picky eater! Overall, I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Suds is family friendly, has good bar food, and attentive staff.  Our family has eaten at suds on at least a dozen occaisions, and it has always been a pleasant experience.  You can't go wrong if you are looking for a casual dinner out."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise this place was!  Randomly saw this place in search of dinner and decided to stop in.  Very clean, nice staff, and they had Thirsty Dog 12 Dogs of Christmas for Christmas in July!  Cannot complain.  We had the Pub pretzels for an appetizer, which were delicious.  I had the 50/50 Burger which was also delicious.  Really laid back atmosphere with hot, quick-served food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice for lunch in the past couple months.  The location does not do this place justice.  Friendly service, great pub grub, and decent beer selection.  The crazy tots are a must-do."}
{"text":"Large parties STAY AWAY!!!  Service was horrible.  Gave management a week notice that a large group was coming after football game on A Thursday.  They did not staff accordingly.  I felt bad for the 2 waitresses that were trying to take care of 40 people. SHAME on management.  Took 45 minutes to get 1st round of drinks. Took another hour to get food and took 1 1/2 hours to sort through the billing issues.  Definitely won't be back.  There are other places close by that are accommodating.  C Ya  Hot Carl"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Sud's since it opened. I started coming here because it was close to home  but I have been coming back on a regular  basis because  of the great food and good beer prices. They have a good variety of delicious appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, pizza and salads.( There burgers and  pizza are my favorites though.)  I have recommended this place to family, friends and co-workers for the past 2 years and not one of them have been disappointed.  If fact many of them are regulars now too.  The combination of friendly staff and great high end bar food keep us all coming  back."}
{"text":"We had very high hopes coming for dinner a few weeks back. I had come in prior w friends and just ordered apps. They were decent, beer was good, and service was ok. So thought we would try dinner. BAD IDEA.   1.we were greeted at the door and told someone would be right w us to seat us. 10 minutes later...we were finally sat. Open tables, not crowded. That should have been our cue to leave.  2. Ordered beers...which were slightly above room temperature. Sent those back.   3. Server seemed nice enough, just slow. Ordered apps, were mediocre. Ordered the pretzles and beer sauce, the sauce was super runny, also ordered the steak roll things. No flavor what so ever other than the horseradish dipping sauce.   4. Entr√©es were terrible, I had the turkey wrap, it had no flavor and looked like the cheapest turkey I have ever seen. My husband order a burger and it was awful, and fries were cold and hard.  5. The kicker was the regulars that were next to us were rude, kept pulling our waitress over, eyeballing our table so they could take it, and made eating there very uncomfortable.    We will never return. It was not worth our time and money. If I want to eat mediocre food, and be watched as I eat,  i will  stay home, throw a pizza in the oven and be watched by our cats as i eat it. . At least i will have cold beer!"}
{"text":"the service was absolutely HORRIBLE! it has potential. I was in there on a friday after work with some friends and it was PACKED for the fish special.  I had the artichoke dip along with the pulled pork quesidilla's which were AMAZINGGGG. The food was good but the service was very bad."}
{"text":"We had a private party last night for my adoptive parents 40th wedding anniversary. It was awesome and the staff was great!  The only thing I might recommend is a cooler room when temperatures get sticky out.  It was a big party and they were very accommodating. The appetizers were very good. The wings and pizza tasted delicious. The drinks were strong and the bartender always had a smile on her face. All in all in was an excellent evening.   I'll definitely return for a meal or some drinks."}
{"text":"We were seated right away. Place was update inside - industrial, open space with garage doors.   They were out of Labatts on tap, which was one of the specials, but they made it right for us. They had about 8 beers on tap  We ordered the Loaded Nachos - nice size portion of nachos. Had onions, peppers, beef, beer cheese. They were good, but were served to us a little chilly.   My husband ordered the Suds Sub burger, which is like a Roman burger - he said it was like a Roman but with a fresher taste. He also had the tater tots with his sandwich, which were ok. Would have like them to be more done   I had the Charlie Big Boy (without a bun) - it was suppose to be like a \"Big Boy\" - it wasn't really, but it was good. I had fries which were good  Our server was very attentive.   Would go back"}
{"text":"Great vibe.  Beer specials, solid food and a kick a$$ patio. Came from Fairview Park and will do it again.  Plus the Tribe win game 2 of the ALDS, so good luck place!"}
{"text":"For a \"bar\" they have fantastic food... the pizza is terrific.  The staff is friendly, good food..... can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We love going to Suds with the family.  The kids usually split a burger and we get sandwiches.  I love the sweet potato fries.  Great beer selection and you can watch the games from anywhere.  The patio is a blast in the summer.  The staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, and the service quickly learns you by name. The prices are on par with the neighborhood, and late night the bathrooms were immaculate, which to me says a lot about the management of a restaurant. I always feel places with a dirty bathroom always seem indicative of dirtier other places. Kenny the owner introduced himself, and genuinely seemed appreciative of our business."}
{"text":"Great to see Suds back...ambiance is not the same but I would recommend the Philadelphia Cheese Steak Sandwich"}
{"text":"I grew up locally but haven't lived in Berea in years. And I stumbled around found this gem. Their food was amazing, the cocktails were on point and the service lightning quick. I went there over half my brief trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Suds has great burgers and great tater tots. One of the best bugers around. The italian burger is like a Mr Hero (for those in the Cleveland area) roman burger but even better. I've never had their pizza but it always looks great and people are always ordering them any time I'm there.  What i really like is that you can get a mini pitcher of beer there. Just enough to have more than a beer. My husband and i often split one or two and it's perfect."}
{"text":"Let me just say...wow! I tend to stay away from taking my dad's advice but this lunch recommendation was just what I wanted!   It's set off on Bagley road, driving by I would never think to stop there...but boy am I glad I did! Upon walking in we passed their patio which was a pretty decent size. The also had a portion of the bar that was open to sit outside. The inside was very rustic...so cool! Old wooden booths, the bar top, host stand, I loved it!   We were greeted by our server right away who gave us a menu larger than I expected! As well as another small clipboard type menu with food and drink specials.   Me, being the pizza LOVER I am, wanted Pizza but was ready to settle for anything just to check this place out. Low and behold, the menu has MULTIPLE pizza selections with all different types of pizzas. They even had a pizza you could create yourself. They also had very different appetizers, many burgers (also a create-your-own version), sandwiches, wraps and salads!   We only had waters, but even those came in cute little mason jars! We ordered the sweet and spicy pizza which had pepperoni, pineapple and jalape√±os....oh my god was it good!!! My only complaint would be that there were almost a few too many jalape√±os as my boyfriend who loves spicy even thought it was a little too spicy. Oh and did I mention it was HUGE!?! But our server boxed it up for us without even needing to ask.    From the fast service to the large menu, this place is all around GREAT! I'd recommend it to anyone that's in the Berea area!"}
{"text":"Suds is close to home and beats some of the other \"chain\" bar-restaurant type establishments in the area. Their pizza is amazing, the burgers are huge and they have cajun tator tots (yay!) . The service is sometimes questionable as if they are very busy but they aren't, but it is a great local place that will remain in our favorites rotation."}
{"text":"I was really let down by this new restaurant! I was exciting to try it thinking it would be different, but it ended up being nothing memorable.   Pros: Food- The food was solid! The wings were done well and had good flavor. The mock big boy burger was also good! I would recommend the food, but nothing else.   Cons:  Service: With a new restaurant and important thing to have is excited staff! They should want to tell you about the restaurant and what it's specialties are. Customer service is what makes people want to come back! Bars like these are a dime a dozen and really need to have excellent service. Our waitress was not very friendly, fast, or helpful.   Seating: The place is huge which is a nice change, but when we sat down in the booth we realized they were huge. When My 6 and a half foot boyfriend sat back he was still at least a foot away from the table. My feet weren't touching the floor and it was really uncomfortable to eat when you can barely reach the table. Just an awkward set up but certainly not that big of a deal.   Menu: Nothing special, basic bar food. Nothing memorable, I like when restaurants have one thing they are \"known for\".   Price: Lastly I thought the prices were really high. $9 for 10 wings and over $11 for the basic burger seems a little steep for this place. I could think of a dozen places with the same type of food for way less.   sorry Suds Maguire, I hate to do this but you just didn't do it for me!"}
{"text":"I recently attended a private event here. So first, they have a nice private room with a full bar.   The space was quite large and pretty open. Our menu consisted of a variety of appetizers including pizza, boneless wings, salad, spinach and artichoke dip and maybe something I'm missing.  It was pretty tasty bar food. In particular I really enjoyed the dip with warm pita bread.   Parking was tight."}
{"text":"We wanted something really casual and easy for our wedding rehearsal dinner and after dining there a few times, we decided Suds Maguires would be perfect. We worked with Jason to arrange the details and he was so awesome. We had a pretty large group- about 35 people- but he allowed us to order off the menu. The private room is great- plenty of space, private restrooms, separate bar. I wish I could remember the other guy who was helping to take orders and tend bar. They worked so hard to make sure our party went smooth. You wouldn't believe it was just 2 people doing all of it, but all of our guests were very happy. They had some appetizers hot and ready when we arrived and our food order (remember, 35 oFF THE MENU orders!) did not take long at all.  I recommend Suds for not only your fun, casual dining experience, but also for parties and events!  They have so many options on how to arrange the menu, the bar, the room. It was very affordable and perfect for our rehearsal dinner!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite bar in Berea.  The food is always delicious whether you are aiming for healthy or greasy bar food.  The portions are huge.  The choice of beer selections is incredibly large and they are able to make s wide variety of drinks.  The only bummer is they removed sparkling wine, so no more mimosas!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with some friends for a drink and some food. They have a great selection of beer and alcohol. We ordered a bit of everything here and it was all very good. A buddy got a wrap with some horseradish that was a bit over the top for him but they made it right and brought him a new one no questions asked. I will be back by when in town."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun, energetic, sports bar, the restaurant is very clean offers entertainment like Basketball free throw arcade setup. The beer menu is pretty good offering craft and domestic beers. The food menu is your typical bar food, but the quality is much better. I had a special burger not sure if it's offered a lot, but it was amazing. The wings were very good as well."}
