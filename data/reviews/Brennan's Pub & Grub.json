{"text":"Apparently this is NOW one of our local pubs! Sort of hidden in a strip mall. Its very large inside and had some nice sounding food special although we didn't eat. 
Awesome 4 Peaks Kiltlifter on draft and $3.50 Fireball Fridays! Great service from the bartender, serving drinks with a smile!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Brennan's for years now. I'm 27 now but started coming here as a kid to Brennans and would catch Suns games with my Dad and brothers and enjoy some Wings. Brennans is a shining example of what a neighborhood bar should be. It has always been everyones Cheers. The staff here is top notch. They are all very interesting characters. Wayne, who is the lead Bartender has been there since the beginning, is the absolute best. Just talk to the guy and observe him and you will understand what I am speaking of. Sean is also a great bartender and makes a mean mean drink. If he likes you, he will make you the \" Red Sox Shot \" It is LEGENDARY.  Jordan who bartends and serves there, knows how to ask the cooks to make the wings a special way that make them even more amazing. Flavor suggestion: Honey Hot.  Great spot to go for all the basketball and football games, drink prices are very accommodating as well. The football crowd on Sundays is fun. You have some real die hard fans that go there for football, you have some people out with laptops placing bets over the internet, fantasy football going, Bloody Mary's flowing. I live in San Diego now, but every time I come into town, its an absolute must to go to Brennan's for all these reasons and more. Enjoy yourself and sit up at the bar so you can experience the bartenders. If you want to mess with Wayne, talk about the Raiders. :)

{"text":"I go to Brennans on a weekly basis for Taco Tuesdays. I always enjoy there tacos. Service is hit or miss sometimes depending on if the help all shows. So if you go be sure to be patient.

Many of the patrons that frequent there know each other very well."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. Beer and food is great, neighborhood bar so it's convenient. Went in today for my last time. They were short handed which I could understand, but the managers were even terrible. Server never brought our food, let alone check on us. I had to get up to get a beer, napkins, plates, etc. Had to basically yell and wave my arms just to get the check...we complained about the service only to get a \"thumbs up\" and a smile then walked away....LITTERALLY. No joke. The manager kept saying he would get our server to us, which never happened. All tables around us were just as unsatisfied.  Too bad for them, I know after today many people will not be back."}
{"text":"\"I've been going to Brennan's for many years now. I decided to write a review since I have stopped drinking. The food during the day shift is always hard for them to not overcook the fried food choices. And don't even bother having a french dip, slow cooking is not on the menu. The Monday night wing special after 6pm and the Friday all-you-can eat fish fry from 11am-10pm are good reasons to go out and enjoy a few beers.\""}
{"text":"If you have a craving for a good, greasy cheeseburger look no further! Whenever I have the craving I'm right there. 

Now, if you like mozzarella sticks and I mean the real ones don't order them here. What they call mozzarella sticks are basically two giant logs, yuck! They just don't taste good. 

Beer is always cheap here and the mixed drinks are okay if you say not too much ice. 

Basically it's a great neighborhood bar to chill and watch some sports on the many t.v.'s and eat good food."}
{"text":"I love this bar. They have amazing nachos and the staff is amazing - Jaki, Kaleigh and Wayne. I don't ever have to wait long for a drink. Oh yeah and sex trivia on Saturday night is so much fun."}
{"text":"I've recently been trying to find a cool place to play shuffleboard in North Phoenix.  I was trying to find a place to hang out near my bro's house so we could go hang out for a bit and have a beer.  I found Brennan's online and noted that they had shuffleboard.  WIN WIN!!  The review said that the staff was friendly and called you \"honey\" even if it was the first time you had ever been there.  BANG!  sounds like my kinda joint, so  i called my bro and said, \"hey man, let's go to this joint by your house and play some shuffleboard and have a beer\".  So, off we went.  I got there and when I approached the bar, the bartender looked at me like I was from Mars. I said hello, FIRST. She says Hi.  Then I said \"How's it going?\"  I felt like I was demonstrating to her how to greet a customer. So I ordered drinks, asked for shuffleboard disks and some menus. I was told that I could grab my own menu and that if I wanted something, I needed to come back and order.  Cool,  no biggie,  but no points for hospitality there.  No real attempt at gaining some sort of an EARNED tip, no prob, it's only my first impression of the place.  SO,  we play some shuffle board.  5 red disks, 3 blue, that's all they have and the shuffleboard table was not in proper working order and it wasn't like the guy sitting on his butt in the office right there was gonna check on us to see if everthing was okay.  So, it don't matter, we's having some beers and it's all good.  We get hungry and decide to look at the menus.  The menus said that THURSDAY was Indian Fry Bread day. Apparently, I am told that they haven't done that IN A LONG TIME.  I guess they didn't get around to changing the menu, but hey it's only my first impression of the joint.  Glad the regulars love it, they can have it.  Oh and I agree with a former poster about the Irish draw of the place.  I thought it was gonna be an Irish place,  not even close.  Crappy hospitality, limited beer menu etc......"}
{"text":"The burger is really good but I look a lot for service too. Been here three times, first time was a little slow but awesome. Second time I asked for no lettuce or tomato on my burger and the male bartender said \"it comes on the side anyways\". Got my burger with the stuff on it. Third time I went in there the same male bartender walked past me three times without saying a word. I had to get up and walk out. Pretty pathetic to be honest."}
{"text":"I used to drink a lot. I mean, I still do, but I'm not in my 20's anymore liver! I shall wrap up about 70 trips here into one review. I used to live in quite a short stumble distance from here, so I frequented knowing I could avoid a DUI and always have a good and safe time. 
There are so many positives. Let me add that this and the (other former Brennan's East of here) are quite different. Yeah, this is in a strip mall, as a ton of bars in AZ are. There is no outside seating. There is a lot of indoor seating- booths and tables galore as well as a large bar with extended seating. For some reason the booths to the left side of the door seem to be made for either children or anorexics. The rest seem just fine! 
It's a little aged, clean enough, older place. They have darts, pool, shuffleboard,and bartop games. I have never had bad service here. Honestly. The servers and bartenders are attentive and motivated. 
The menu at this Brennan's is huge! If you can't find something you like here I would be shocked. Let me tell you they sure don't skimp on cheese. Order anything with cheese and you shall see. The mozzarella sticks are the size of cucumbers! A word of advice: Share a meal. The portions could feed 6 people (unless an ala cart choice). 
Trivia on Wednesday's for cash and Sex Trivia Saturday's for sex toys! Who can resist that?! (Hey, put your cell phones down- no one likes a cheater! Yeah, you!) 
Prices are great as well. Happy hour gives you a good bang for your buck. 
It's a fun, local type bar that always felt safe and welcoming. Used to feel like \"Cheers\" to me. Too bad I can't stumble here anymore, but I still visit often. 
Never had a bad time and if I were a fly on the wall, I'm sure I could write a lot more here. :)"}
{"text":"Good service on a Sunday night after a movie. Not busy at all. Kitchen was closed when we got there about 10pm. I would come here for drinks again."}
{"text":"Massive disappointment sums up my lunch here. There were no Irish beers besides Guiness for my companion, service was so slow, I felt nauseated from hunger by the time my food arrived, and the meal itself tasted like a frozen tv dinner. This is the least Irish, Irish bar I've ever been to. The only pro of this place is that they serve Pibb."}
{"text":"Went to Brennan's for the first time after work today.  

Pros: The Irish Nachos were huge and really good.  Waitress were nice to look at. They had quite a few TVs with baseball.

Cons:  I love a dive, but when I sat at the bar it was more dingy than dive.  Pretty dark and older looking.  The TV's also seemed smaller around the bar area but that could be just me.   I may of come in on a rough day but the customers where I was seated skewed older and a bit unpleasant.  I know this not the bars fault but did kill the vibe.

I definitely will go back since the food was good, and would like to get in on a game of pool."}
{"text":"This place has completely given up. I don't know if they have had new owners within the last 4 months or so but its gotten really bad. Unless your one of the regulars who have probably been drinking since 11am you don't get much attention here.

Just went there tonight for the 35 cent wings on Monday night. Waited 5 minutes before the lazy waitress decided to come greet me. Placed my order right away as I could tell how often I would see her again. Just got 2 dozen wings. ....... 45MINS LATER my wings show up. Not exaggerating at all. NEWSFLASH- Wings take 8mins in the fryer...why would I have to wait 45mins??? When they finally showed up I let her know Ill just take them to go since Im out of time. She didn't seem to care at all I was clearly upset. Also NOT ONE TIME did she refill my drink...not one time. And to top of the whole fun experience I get the check to find out they have stopped the wings deal on Monday. 

Its sad cause I used to go here with all my friends every Monday and this place had good waitresses who cared but like I said earlier these people now don't care one bit. NEVER AGAIN. Thank Jackie for the great experience and hope you can find another dump hole to work in 6 months when this place is closed."}
{"text":"I come in every Tuesday for enchiladas. I always get amazing food, and great service from Cinnamon! She's the best!"}
{"text":"This place is right by my house, and I love stopping in for a drink after work. It's quiet, the bar staff is extremely friendly, and after the first time I went in there, the bartender remembered me and my spouses drinks. We were well taken care of and will definitely be going back semi-regularly. We like this spot!"}
{"text":"We went here for Taco Tuesdays. The enchiladas and the tacos are 1.50 each on Tuesdays. I loved the enchiladas with green sauce, and my wife loved the tacos. The chips and salsa were fine. The service was fine, but it seemed like the servers were a bit busy with the crowd. I am looking forward to trying some of the other foods."}
{"text":"Really bad service Kaitlyn is horrible
This place  is a dump they mess up people's orders a lot 
It's old and like a ghost town which speaks volumes plus the unattractive bartender tried to hit on me 
I would not recommend the food or the atmosphere"}
{"text":"And now, the Killian's Red is gone. However, they've swapped it with Kiltlifter, just as delicious and more local! =9"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and his friends before we left AZ to go back to the bay. I was surprised to see that there weren't tons of people in there as it was a Monday night and tons of games on.

Brennan's is a hug bar and has tons of seating and tv's to get your sports fix. We found a booth and were warmly greeted by our server. The boy and his friends ordered 35 cent wings and I had a cheeseburger with curly fries.

My cheeseburger and curly fries totally hit the spot. The curly fries were were crispy and had tons of flavor, they were a little spicy. The burger was really filling and was exactly what I wanted! The boys completely devoured their wings, and at 35 cents, you can imagine just how many they had between them.

For our flight, my boyfriend ordered the margarita chicken wrap and it tasted great even a few hours later...yum!

Brennan's is a solid spot to catch a game and grab some yummy pub food in a laidback environment."}
{"text":"One word; Fun! Great bar with terrific food. The onion rings are spot on, and as a Wisconsin fan, when someone puts cheese curds on a menu I am so there. Great place to play pool, ping pong, and shuffleboard.  Owner and staff are funny and take care of you. Cannot wait to hang out there again."}
{"text":"First off... this is not an \"Irish pub\" nor does it have anything to do with Celtic culture. I found this out after asking why the menu had tons of mexican dishes but no Irish dishes... the server laughed at me with a rude attitude. To add to the insult, they have green clovers all around and call themselves a pub. Anyways, I asked our waitress to replace the plastic water cup she gave me after realizing it had cracked edges all around the top (as did 3 of the 4 other people sitting with me). Not only did I ask her to replace the water glass- I mentioned to have her throw it away since germs fester on drinkware and dishes... Yet with an attitude she said she would NOT give me a new water glass and she would NOT throw it away since the owner would never allow them to do so. I was completely dumbfounded. I guarantee this company would not pass any sort of restaurant food inspection. It was safe to say we got up and left. Horrific \"service\". That server should be fired and the owner needs to have a reality check if that's how he instructs his employees to treat patrons in his establishment. I wish I could give them negative stars it was so bad. Left with disgust in our mouths. Do yourself a favor and do not go into this dump of a MEXICAN wanna be sports bar(?)!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this bar in a few years, but when Wayne is behind the bar it's always a good experience. He's well over 40 and has more energy than most 20 year old bartenders. 

Wayne is the type of man who gives respect when it's given. He may come off as rude but that's just how he talks lol. 

Anyways, I had the nachos (half) and they were awesome! 

Thanks again."}
{"text":"Totally diff from the Cantina in Scotts obviously no chips and salsa  here. This is a great neighborhood bar I basically lived here thru football season's ages ago. If you hate Raider fan's I suggest steering clear of the times they play (if they still have the club there that is) Raider fan's are crazy and it is usually not so much fun after the games when they lose which is most of the time! They do have many many tvs their site says 24 total. They have a seperate area for betting on the dog races that was always huge with the older crowd. 

They use that canned shredded meat here in some meals which I think people immediately love it or hate it. I dont like it so much it's too salty and soggy but I never really liked meat anyway. I solved that problem and just eat sushi now, so who am I to say if the chicken is really good or not?!?! I am fine with some fried zucchini or those stuffed jalapeno things or even nachos minus the meat. I remember their wraps as being really good though! Don't confuse the bartender by asking for a foofoo mixed drink. You mill be lucky if they have some flavored vodka. Beer is king here and I seen a many people do Irish car bombs but hey you cant really get those wrong now, can you? Beer me please!"}
{"text":"Friday night, pretty busy, bar somewhat busy and the bartender (attractive, female, brunet) answers the house phone and has been talking for 15 minutes as I write this..  ????  WTF..  never coming back.."}
{"text":"Ordered a Bloody Mary with gin, he put vodka in! 4 people at the bar, no excuse. Ordered a burger, most disgusting thing I have ever tasted.  I was sick all night, what's the phone # of the health dept!? I should have told the guy and not paid, but it was early NYE and the place was empty. I feel sick to my stomach. Never again at this place! Stay away from the burgers."}
{"text":"The burger is not that good  it is a frozen patty \"charbroiled\" to a nice grey color with decent spices. DO NOT go looking for a flame grilled hand pattied medium rare burger, This is not it. 

The place is cool, the service was good. I have a feeling the food is second to the drinks."}
{"text":"Hands down best bar in all of Arizona!! My wife and i have to have fries (with cheese and bacon here and there)
Wings are great drinks are great!"}
{"text":"Found this neighborhood pub very close to home, excited to finally have a near by pub to call my spot. Unfortunately, the customer service, myself and my group experienced was below par. The night started off well with a funny/attentive Bartender named Wayne, good atmosphere for saint Patrick's day, a bit of an interesting crowd. The ending of the night is the reason behind the one star, as we were making our way out of the bar. A female server was aggressively disrespectful, by stating, \"get the F*** out, go home!\". I have worked in the service industry and understand at the end of day wanting to go home, but it was 3 minutes after last call. The bartender who was kind at first also joined in the banter of telling us to leave. It was a very poor example of customer service. Especially for a group who was hoping to make it their pub of choice close to home. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Hmmmmmmm when u walk in there's a mold smell. There is a one stall bathtoom for a pretty big bar. I find that weird.  They claim to have happy hour special which is a quarter off . Seriously ? Why bother ? Seems like alot of regulars come to this barm we r only stopped by cause we r going nto movies next door.  Let me say this place has the saddest rueben I have ever saw !!! See photo. My husband order ordered chicken wings he liked the sauce. We appear to be the only one in the place eating food. The waitress was super nice.  Thanks fpr paying attention dawn ."}
{"text":"Great dive bar. Cold beer, lots of tap choices and one huge plate of nachos. Service is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place rules.   Family friendly,  single person comfortable,  and all around just clean plain fun.   Love this place.   All the bartenders rock."}
{"text":"Cant beat $1.25 tacos & cheese enchiladas, half price Mexican appetizers and $2.00 margaritas on Tuesdays!!"}
{"text":"Great local place to come! Sports, music, trivia, and great food! Won't break the bank either! Jackie is the best bartender and won't leave you waiting forever."}
{"text":"Great atmo for a mon. Bartender is nice and they have all the bar games. Ping pong, darts (all their darts are broken, bring your own if ya can), shuffle board, golden tee and pac man!  Great neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Although I had a good time at Four Peaks earlier in the week, I felt more at home at Brennan's for some reason.  Possibly because the staff was pretty friendly.  And what's this?  Is that Jager on tap?  Wow.

I had a couple of greyhounds and a couple of rum and pineapples. Our waitress was very nice and offered her recommendations for shots (which I didn't take but you're welcome to try the Washington Apple and tell me about it later). 

Our friend didn't seem to enjoy his chicken quesadilla. He described the chicken as \"worse than McDonald's chicken mcnuggets.\"  

But hey, I'd only come back for drinks.  And possibly because it's next to the greatest combo store next door, Billiards and Hookah. Ha!"}
{"text":"This place is a  good , fun minded bar/restaurant . I have gone in there enough to find it consistent ,  the bar staff is super friendly and very attentive ,  The place is laid out effectively to accommodate a pretty large crowd , and by design with a high occupancy it does not feel cramped ... They have a fun version of sexual trivia on Saturday nights , good times !"}
{"text":"We are pretty much regulars at Brennans now. It is a reliable place to watch the game with cheap drinks. There is a great view of the TV from almost every spot.

The bartenders are AWESOME. They are quick,  friendly, and really seem to care about providing good service. 

The servers are good too. Very sweet and take care of their regulars. There is confusion among them sometimes about who is helping our table but it is usually resolved quickly and they are apologetic.

The food that is good is very good, the food that is bad is pretty bad. Luckily, the number of items on the menu that is good outnumbers the bad. Here is a rundown on the good stuff- the Irish Nachos, Mexican pizza, cheese curds, potato skins, wings, enchiladas. All pretty good. Oh, and salsa too. It's freshly made and very zippy!

I would stay away from the zucchini and mozzarella sticks. Both are too greasy and lacking in flavor. The mozzarella stick is ginormous, which seems appealing at first but it is just too much cheese and too little breading. 

I wish they had more food specials because the appetizers will set you back 7-10 bucks a plate. But the portions are huge. They do have an amazing mexican night on Tuesday. $1.25 enchiladas and tacos. And we were pleasantly surprised about how tasty the tacos and enchiladas are. 

The crowd in Brennans is diverse and interesting. I love a diverse crowd and all but be prepared to listen to either a full hour of country or a full hour of gangsta rap on the jukebox. That can get annoying when the jukebox is completely dominated by a person whose musical tastes are limited to one genre. 

Overall, we love Brennans and we can call it our home away from home."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall with tons of room for activities! Pool, ping pong, darts, and shuffleboard oh my! Jukebox, great prices, and a good menu make this a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Sometimes we will stop by and get some food as well as drinks and play some pool. 
A couple weeks ago we went in and the waitress we had was beyond very rude. She had strawberry blonde hair. Cant remember her name. But wouldn't let us behind the shuffle board area with drinks in our hands, we had to be visible to her standards. And wouldn't give our cash back after she took our bill. Kept an eye on all of us the whole night and when we would want something she would give us a tone. Also started to clean our table up when we werent even close to being done yet. SUPER RUDE. Our whole table couldnt believe the service we were getting from her. We love going in there cause every waitress we had was a sweetheart but after her I don't think we will be back as much."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and clients but they're really leaving $ on the table by the lack of TVs and that half of them aren't in HD and several are small. They really need to invest some money in upgrading this place.

One bartender on Sunday NFL and he's pretty slow. 

Also, one bathroom doesn't have a lock on the door?!

They have shuffleboard (not regulation length), two pool tables, darts and ping pong.

No patio."}
{"text":"BRENNAN'S IS THE BEST! What an awesome place to come and chill with my dear friends. Not to mention the staff is the best. Jaki, Wayne, Kat - all of them!"}
{"text":"We walked over from our vacation rental yesterday, and came back today!!  Both times were mid day, mid week . Jackie is super friendly!!! Lunch was fantastic!!! Other customers at the bar, probably regulars here, were very friendly!! That is not always the case when you're out of towners! We'll be back on our next trip to the area!!"}
{"text":"Friday nights are always good at Brennan's. Jackie (bartender & waitress) has an intoxicating smile - anyone would feel welcome.  The whole staff rocks!

Burgers are huge and juicy and Mexican pizza is good too.

Pool tables need a lot of work but a good neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"My two friends and I stop in here quite regularly for happy hour. We love coming here for the drinks as well as the food. However, the main reason we come here is because of the wonderful bartender Wayne! He's always in a good mood and you can tell he genuinely cares about the people who frequent this place. Thank you Wayne!!"}
{"text":"The best patty melt and the best onion rings I've had. Friendly staff! Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Closest bar to my home. Decided to stop in for a beer and potatoes skins and wings. The appetizers are great here. Sat down and had drunk friend of the staff show up at our table claiming he knew us. The staff quickly ushered him off but returned a short while later again. The waitress took our order. Asked for two blue moons tall. Returned with beers and then asked if we wanted oranges. We  said yes. Waitress returned with two orange slices face down on a napkin! Ate the great potato skins and wings. Tabbed out I split the bill with my brother we both left two dollars each, four dollars total for 30 bill. On the way out the waitress made her displeasure with the tip verbally known 'I ain't taking no two dollar tips.\" This was my second visit in a year. Las visit was told by waitress \"I got to take care  of my regulars\" as i sat waiting 10 minutes to place drink order. Use to be really good family pub, now they want you to join in sex trivia on some nights."}
{"text":"Great food I had the margarita chicken wrap. My wife had Philly cheesesteak she thought it was great."}
{"text":"Great place to go and have a pint or 2.  They have darts ping pong and pool to name a few games.  Drea gave us outstanding service and always with a smile!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. Cheap drinks plus the waitresses are the very best. Sex trivia on Saturdays at 9pm are the best!"}
{"text":"Compared to the now-defunct North Star Lounge, Brennan's is a gem. I've never eaten here but I'm sure it's not that bad. Kind of a step up from most dives in Phoenix and North Phoenix. 

They have tons of TVs, ping pong and a pool table. There's some degenerates but nothing too crazy. Sean the bartender is a great host; I recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I loved coming here on Saturdays for sex trivia. However, there is this one waiter that would always serve us that was completely rude, smart mouthed, and just an all around bad attitude. I was just in utter shock how a person that relies on tips for their living could be so rude. Since the last encounter with him, we haven't been back. It's a real shame because I really enjoyed hanging out there."}
{"text":"There was a work event here that I attended and we were all given a burger with fries. The burger was undercooked, and obviously frozen patties. It came out soggy and not speaking.

The bright side, the wait staff was phenomenal. She was very on top of our drinks and super friendly."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun! And they have sex trivia Saturday nights. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"We go to this place quite a bit for wings and a cold beer, but if you're looking for fast service, this is not the place to go.  Although the waitress, for the most part, are friendly, there's a new one every week. We continue to visit this place to play trivia and again, for the wings and queso dip."}
