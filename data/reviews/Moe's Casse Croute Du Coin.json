{"text":"Authenticity is what makes places like Shwartz's, Beauty's, Wilensky's and other Montreal favorites the institutions they are and the Casse Croute has it in spades.

I would rather spend a lazy 90 minutes having breakfast here on a Saturday morning than fight the crowds at a place like Eggspectation or Cora. 

I have never had anything but breakfast here but my wife absolutely loves their grilled cheese sandwiches. I also like that they don't give me a hard time when I show up with a Starbucks coffee.

This is definitely one of my favorite places in the city. The neighborhood is about to change in a major way with the new condo tower going up around the corner. I hope the Casse Croute survives it."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, tasty food, and generous portions make the breakfast deals here hard to beat. The atmosphere is that of an old-fashioned diner, and I really enjoyed it.

I told one of the servers that I found them on Yelp, and he was surprised they're listed."}
{"text":"Montreal breakfast defined! Been coming here for 20 plus years now whenever in Montreal. Not that place to impress a first date but the place to come when she is your wife and the kids are gone for the weekend. Simple, plain greasy breakfast that leaves money in the pocket for the bars that night."}
{"text":"Let's be clear, this is a greasy spoon.  But among greasy spoons, it's a rock star.  It's open 24 hours, serves burgers, shakes, grilled cheese and the other standbys..  It's tucked in a little neighborhood on the back side of the old Forum.

I usually get the Big Ed burger which is a tasty burger with all the fixings, it's the kind of meal that hits the spot every time, even if I know it will sit in my stomach like a ton of bricks.  This is not a place you go to for a farm-fresh apricot salad, or any vegetables for that matter, but when you're in the mood for diner food, the Casse Croute can't be beat!

It's a place stuck in a simpler time and I'm glad they don't have to change..."}
{"text":"Based on the strong reviews of other yelpers I decided to do brunch at Moe's on a rainy Friday and was beyond disappointed with every aspect of the experience, I just don't understand why this place is so highly acclaimed. 
Firstly, the place is an absolute dump, the seats inside are like a simulation for a 12 hr ride on a couch bus and the one small table outside is far from scenic or ambient as large trucks and buses constantly plow through the busy and uninspired area near the dreaded Atwater station. 
I ordered a mushroom, cheese and bacon omelette, only to be greeted by 3 of the most rubbery eggs prepared on a cafeteria flat grill and filled with poorly sauteed mushrooms, proceeded cheese and an average strip of bacon and complimented with under cooked home fries and some wonder bread. 
If that wasn't enough. the service was beyond bad, it was non existent! The waitress/grill cook was like a quebec version of lunch lady doris and didn't say two words to me other than 'here's your bill'. 
As an exclamation point she was pumping old school boy band music throughout the meal; luckily I was able to nab the outside table before I hung myself with a noose made from Moe's rubbery food.
There are so many amazing diners in Montreal, don't waste your time here, Place Milton is not too far away and will serve you an infinitely better meal. 
Not to be too insensitive but I don't think it's a coincidence that a massacre occurred near this dinner; bad food can make people pretty unhappy!"}
{"text":"My hubby and i being late night breakfast enthusiast, we use to have to go all the way to Miami deli in Hochelaga. Browsing Yelp?we found this gem. 
As we arrived the first time, we were surprised of how small it is, but it was busy even at 3 am. 
They have a menu and a breakfast menu.
We both took full breakfast and the prices are really cheap. Includes tea or coffee and toast. The potatoes are so good i am impressed.

Less than 20$ for 2 person breakfast in Montreal is the cheapest i have found. Plus its nicely located if you were going out downtown.
I recommend this place if you want a late night bite."}
{"text":"Meme si l'endroit ne paie pas de mine, Le Big Ed Burger est tout simplement succulent! La poutine pas géniale (frites et fromage industriels, sauce bof. ). Le personnel sans complexe et sympatique."}
{"text":"While moes look like a cheap comfy diner that will produce excellent breakfasts and comfort foods it really isn't that great. The atmosphere and staff are good but the food is pretty shitty and definitely not a bargain. Last time I had breakfast they were skimpy on the potatoes, the coffee cream was curdled and the cook broke both of my sunny side egg yolks but served them anyways. I've been many times and honestly, you can get a better breakfast pretty much anywhere for the same price or less. The burger/fries/diner food are better but could easily be improved. More quality control is needed, if the buns are stale then throw them out! Get it together moes. If you serve simple food it should be near perfect, especially at the prices being charged"}
{"text":"Simple and humble little diner.
I had the regular breakfast with coffee, buttered toast, potatoes, 3 eggs, bacon (they have few options). Good value. Good service.

They have massive selections of food, would love to come back one day!"}
{"text":"First Montréal visit. Great out of the way spot with amazingly good breakfast. Felt like family!"}
{"text":"This place has a very special place in my heart.  I used to live on the corner across from Casse Croute (aka Moe's) - and I couldn't have survived my one year in university without their coffee and good humored tolerance of long hours spent with books at their counter.   It was - and probably still is -  a 24 hour, family run greasy spoon with the greatest personalities and seriously delicious, cheap food day in and day out.   Can't be beat."}
{"text":"for the price it is really worth it! great diner and friendly staff too ! yes as many said its a grease hole but the food is good that is what's important no?"}
{"text":"First off let me say I like Moe's... it's just the kind of place where I like to eat breakfast, cozy, unpretentious, fast and cheap.  I would have given Moe's 4 stars if it had been cleaner... they need to close for a day and do a deep clean.  That said the breakfast was unpretentious, fast, cheap and made perfectly to order.  I will say it again and hope that they read it: they need to close for a day and do a deep clean..."}
{"text":"Long live Moe's!! So many amazing memories of 4am milkshakes with my cegep friends and awkward breakfast dates with guys and squeezing into those booths and bitching with my friends over awesome greasy food and many many coffee refills. May you rest happily in the grand slam in the sky."}
{"text":"- greasy spoon diner that hasn't been cleaned in forever.
- perfect if you're a student, or hungover, or broke.
- nothing to write home about. it's a breakfast diner in the basement of a small corner building near the old montreal forum (now an AMC movie theatre)
- open 24 hours btw"}
{"text":"The dependable grease-hole.
I loved going here as a student and love returning as a drunk workin man. They have a variety of diner meals and breakfast plates to wake you up or sober you up. These guys never rest."}
{"text":"Always happy with the food and the service no matter what the time or the shape I'm in when I visit ;)"}
{"text":"Moes is your standard greasy spoon diner. It's a tiny basement, one room joint with a menu that's far too big. The food is what you'd expect, cheap and tasty enough, but my big complaint is the size of the seating. At 6`6\" it's almost impossible for me to fit in any of their seating (extremely uncomfortable cramming occurs) and if I was a few pounds bigger it would be impossible. 

It might be time to update those booths guys, and fix the table side jukeboxes."}
{"text":"Nice quaint restaurant right across the street from le tour belvedere.

Simple breakfast eats ( French toast,eggs,bacon,sausage,tea and toast) I yammed it all down. 
Maybe I was hungry don't know but it was good to me

Only set back honestly, an annoying ass fly hovering by our table as my friend and I are eating.

If they do not sell the place,at stop by again due to the convience as well as the staff service."}
{"text":"Ordered the steak and eggs combo. 

Satisfactory food, the portion was slightly small but the menu was very well priced. 

Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Fast service, excellent food, it's cozy, and full of cheap eats. 

This place is a Montreal staple, a hidden gem, a greasy spoon, a hole in the wall. Whether you choose to come here for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or are in need of a late night munch - you will not be disappointed! They serve breakfast around the clock, even in to the whee hours of the night! Their grand slam is fantastic, their grilled cheese is delightful, and their Big Ed burger is mouth-watering! Those are just a few of my favourites, as you can see. 

I used to come here more when I went to Dawson, but now I'll stumble in on the occasional drunken-wander or for a hangover brunch. The staff is accommodating, they're friendly and fun. It's not a strict and uptight environment at all. Perhaps it looks run down, but that's what gives it an old fashioned charm."}
{"text":"You're not coming here for the service or food. You come here because you're drunk or hungover and need some greasy grub to fill your tummy. This place does that and then some.

And at 4 am this place is a sure bet compared to most late night eateries in this city. 

Please note I have never eaten here sober, not because I have a drinking problem but because I never had the urge to go hete unless I wss wasted."}
{"text":"Love the fact that they are 24x7 and have 24 hour breakfast, lunch and dinner.   Although..  They need a few air fresheners and accept credit cards.   Cash only is very 1990s."}
{"text":"Fast service. Decent price. Greasy food."}
{"text":"24/hour breakfast place, enough said. But I'll go on, they have other things on the menu too, hot dogs, burgers, poutine, milk shakes and all that. It's where you go when you want some down and dirty grub and preferably when you are drunk. Apparently some major NHL players used to eat here (Patrick Roy?). I've only once ate here in the morning."}
{"text":"Great little hidden place. The breakfast is fairly large (and even cheaper if you go before 10am) and the burgers are quite tasty.

It's a simply, good, old fashioned diner and if you're into greasy spoons, check it out!"}
{"text":"For all the fancy French brunches in in Montreal, this teeny greasy spoon is so far my favorite for a cheap and cheerful brekkie. Better yet, it's even cheaper before 11am. The food arrives in practically nanoseconds, and is perfect hangover fare: french toast, sausages, fried eggs, bacon, etc. If you're looking for haute cuisine, Vieux Montreal is that way, bub! ;) 

The people that work there are super-friendly, and the crowd ranges from neighborhood retirees to college students to punks and hipsters stumbling in The Morning After. Love it."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Really simple, great service, cheap and old fashioned. Everything you would expect from an old greasy diner and I hope it doesn't change."}
{"text":"lmao, ok this is the ultimate old school greasy spoon,,,,,,but not so greasy.  The little hole in the wall, basement style restaurant downtown montreal - 3 eggs, poached, bacon, hashbrowns, coffee and toast $6.99.  

i would never have found without yelp."}
{"text":"Nice small place, went there several times for brunch. Food is good and cheap, coffee is included in the brunch. Need to pay by cash."}
{"text":"I once ate the most incredible steamy I've ever had in my life. Simple, mustard, cabbage. T'was an orgasm in my mouth. It might have had something to do with the fact that I was seriously inebriated. I returned sober and it wasn't quite as fantastic. But Stills good. 

Tip: go DRUNK!"}
{"text":"I was curious to see what this place is because it seemed to get either great reviews with loyal customers or customers saying it is old and dirty. I would say it is older and sort of run down and in that basement but it has it's own charm, and reminds me of stepping back in time into a restaurant from the madmen era. The breakfasts are big and reasonably priced and very quick too. I recommend trying the croissants or Danishes warm they cut them and fry them on the griddle, comes off warm and buttery. The grand slam breakfast is huge!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice before in the past 5 years and both times it was past 3am and I was hammered. I really thought I loved it. 

I came here last night sober around midnight and got the Grand Slam while my partner got the big Ed burger. The eggs came looking really unappealing, the potatoes were soggy and tasteless, and the French toast just sucked royally. 

The big Ed burger was just two cheap frozen thin pieces of \"meat\" between cheap bread and tons of mayo. 

Really disappointed by you Yelpers that told me to eat this!"}
{"text":"Open 24/7 since the 50s and no one will judge you if you want breakfast at some ungodly hour. This place is haunted by Montreal's hockey triumphs of days gone by, but the ghosts wear a laugh and a smile. And oh I do love me a true casse-croute."}
{"text":"The poutine here sucks. They use thin fries that far too crispy, so they don't pick up the gravy all that well. Then they topped it with shredded cheddar cheese instead of cheese curds. You can't call that poutine. Judging from everyone else's reviews, I'd recommend sticking to the breakfast food."}
{"text":"It's no longer a secret, but sadly Moe's (actually the official name is Casse-Croute du Coin, or Corner Snack Bar) is closing very soon, December 7, 2015.  It's always heartbreaking when this happens for an institution that's been part of the neighbourhood for over 50 years.

I've been a patron since my teen years, and I keep coming back because I can always count on a friendly face greeting me, no matter what time of the day or night.  The menu is extensive, the pancakes are delicious, and you can order anything, anytime of the day.  Moe's is open 24/7/365.

Take this as your opportunity to visit for the last time, and relive the 50s feel with a jukebox machine at every booth, and an old fashioned milkshake.  Yes, this is one place that knows how to make a milkshake!

Moe's staff will make you feel like family, which is rare these days (nostalgia alert), but very refreshing.  Definitely my favourite diner, period, and I'll be very sad to see them go.  Don't miss out."}
{"text":"One last time before it closes when for the standard breakfast. Great to get breakfast all day. Fast & Good. Enjoy it while you can!"}
{"text":"This place is great for what it is. If you want fancy-shmancy, with a bright, sunny decore, this is not for you. If you want Legit Greasy Spoon/diner, covered in hockey memorabilia, then THIS is the place!

I had the grand slam breakfast for $9 (3 eggs, 2 sausage, bacon, homefries, toast, and french toast) and was completely content. My girlfriend thought her meal was a bit on the small side for what hers cost (a grand total of $6 for a 3-egg omelette with sausage, homefries, and toast), but my meal was great so this place still gets 5 stars!

The service was quick and friendly, and I'm a fan of all the posters of great Canadiens  players and other hockey greats. This would be the best place to go the morning after a big night."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall is open 24-7 and can give you any menu option you want. From their breakfast platters to their burgers, you won't be walking out unhappy. The place is tiny and can't hold many people but the food is pretty good. The portions are fair and the prices are fairly low for a filling meal. Night or day, this is the perfect cheap place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"One of the best old fashion dinner & kept secret not so secret in Montréal!

If you crave for an after 3 AM cheesebuger & milkshake this is the place open 24/7.

Tu veux venir bruncher un samedi matin avec ton viel oncle et lui rappeler des souvenirs dans le temps qu'il venait lui même ici avant un match du Canadiens?  You bet it will be nice!

L'ambiance is out of this too fast modern time!  It's a bliss just setting there and chill to eat junk and home confort food.   The service is ok to awesome depending on time you go and who is there.

Saturday morning could be very noisy and it's a bit freezing in the winter when peeps open both doors to get in!

Over all this is a Montreal undeground location that need to stay.  I hope that the \"a vendre\" affiche is just an April fools day ou bien que les new owners will keep this bijoux running!"}
{"text":"I went to Moe's during my visit to Montreal based on Yelp reviews. I thought it would be the perfect quick breakfast after a hangover, or for a late night snack. I wasn't expecting anything fancy, but I think cleanliness is a completely different story!

This diner was absolutely filthy! There were bugs flying everywhere, and they were covering the ceiling of the place. The menus were grungy and the tap water tasted like dirt! The food was fine, it was to be expected, but cleanliness is one thing I absolutely cannot overlook. Clean this place up before you get closed down!"}
{"text":"Pretty good old fashion looking restaurent. Price is cheap with good portion. I like this place a lot. Good thing about this place is open 24/7. Good place to eat after late night outside.

Lot of variety on the menu. You can eat anything on anytime. 

I went this place with few friends and ordered different stuffs.  

They use fresh veggies to make burgers or pitas. But fries aren't that great. Like poutine, hard to eat when it get cold. I wish that they can change it to make dishes better.

Overall good place for the quantity and the quality."}
{"text":"Quintessential diner, in both vibe and service! And cheap to boot, with descent portions. Service is pretty average. Their poutine has shredded mozzarella, which was very weird for a poutine, while the gravy was watery; score: 1/5"}
{"text":"Aaah...souvenir de mes jours de cubicule! Quand je travaillais dans un vrai bureau, un de mes moments favoris était le déjeuner du vendredi matin. Puisque mon chum travaille dans un bureau \"normal\", je l'ai accompagné dans le centre-ville pour le déjeuner. On voulait quelque chose de bon, pas trop cher et pas trop loin non plus. De là est venu l'idée d'aller au Casse-Croûte du Coin. Quand on est entré, il n'y avait personne, pas de musique et c'était sombre. À voir les gens qui servaient, c'était simplement un des rares moments calmes, car peu de temps après avoir reçu nos cafés, les autres sont arrivés. J'ai réalisé à la fin qu'il y a une seule table dehors, et j'aurais bien aimé y être assises. Le déjeuner comme tel était quand même bien mais à chaque fois qu'on m'offre un ou trois ufs ça me mélange. J'aime avoir deux ufs moi! Un ce n'est pas assez, puis quand il y en a trois, je ne suis pas capable de finir mon assiette. J'ai bien aimé les petites patates et le reste est simple et bon, donc à refaire si je passe dans le coin, mais je ne me déplacerais pas nécessairement jusque là pour ma prochaine envie de déjeuner en plein milieu de semaine."}
{"text":"One of my favorite greasy-spoons when i'm in the area after battling the city from a heavy night of drinking when i visit!  My favorite is the grand slam that can help heal all the booze that i take in.. The grand slam:eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes or french toast and homefries...  Ohhh yeah and don't forget the famous Ed's burger...!"}
