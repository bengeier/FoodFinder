{"text":"On New Year's Eve, my husband and I took our boys here while visiting from out-of-town. I grew up in the area and held Sewickley and its restaurants/shops in high regard, so I was confident in trusting the 4/5 stars The Café received from Yelpers. I couldn't have been more wrong in my assumption. 
Our experience was off to a bad start even before we ordered. My oldest son's fingers were pinched by the chair when he scooted in. The pads were detached from the chair frames on three/four chairs at our table. We asked for ice for his fingers with no apology or concern from the wait staff. 
I love fish and always order sea bass when I see it on a menu. I took my first bite and quickly realized that it had an \"off taste\" almost strong like ammonia or a packing solution chemical. Not only was it bad, but it wasn't cooked long enough - mushy consistency for a thick cut of fish. The brussel sprouts (one of my sides) were also clearly from a freezer bag and boiled. Not the quality that I expected from a $28 dish. When our waiter approached the table, I told him that my fish didn't taste right. He stood there and eventually asked, \"What do you want me to do?\" I told him that I wasn't going to eat it. He responded with \"I'll tell the chef and he'll do better job.\" ??? He didn't offer another dish or to remove it from our check. Another waiter saw me sitting there, not touching my plate, and offered to correct the situation. By that time, my family had already finished and I just wanted to leave. 
My husband's steak was also flavorless and of poor quality (again not expected from a $28 dish). My oldest son's pizza was made with refrigerated/pre-made pizza crust and undercooked - unlike any other Margherita pizza I've ever seen. The only one who enjoyed his food was my three-year-old son who ordered buttered pasta. 
We dine out often enough to know and expect better quality when paying these prices. I'm astonished that this restaurant would have repeat customers when there are so many better dining options."}
{"text":"My letter to the owner...

Dear Mr. Reinhardt/Skye,

I wanted to touch base with you regarding an event we had a The Sewickley Café on January 26. It was the luncheon after the funeral for my father.  My mother and I planned this luncheon with every attention to detail to hold back on costs and make it easy for both the wait staff and the kitchen, and make sure there was something for everyone since we had people on dietary restrictions. My mother is on a fixed income as she is not only retired, but has been the caregiver for my father the past three years since his stroke. Everyone agreed the event at The Sewickley Café was a disaster. 

First, the menus were not as discussed. I knew we should have done our own. The salads appeared to be starter salads the way they were listed, the prices were on the menu, and the desserts weren't listed. It was our mistake that we did not stated \"cash bar\". We didn't want a bar tab.
 
The waiter had no idea what was going on. He had to have been the worst ever and I told him. He was rude and inefficient. He knew he was getting a flat gratuity, so there was no need to be otherwise. We had a reservation for 32 people during off-hours with a set menu. There should have been a well-seasoned and professional waiter. His assistant was excellent, but even she couldn't make up for the disaster.

My mother who just buried her husband had to go take the children's food off of the counter to serve the children. They saw it sitting there for 10 minutes and they were starving. Their food was cold when she finally gave it to them. Many people never got their beverage orders and were sick of asking. I didn't get mine until I asked a third time when my meal came. Some people weren't able to eat as they had to go to the airport.  We were there for 30 minutes before drink orders were even taken. The waiter said he was doing the best he could.  I don't think chatting it up with employees is doing the best he could do. One woman sent her lunch back three times, because it was wrong each time. She ended up eating the leftovers of people's desserts around her. 

People were offered a selection from the dessert menus where we had selected two desserts. End of story. Nothing was supposed to be offered that wasn't on the menu unless the three children needed something. That's the purpose of the menu and planning. There was no planning on your part. You should be embarrassed.

I was appalled after this fiasco that there wasn't some sort of discount given for making a very solemn event even worse. Full-price? Full-gratuity? A disgrace! You should be ashamed of yourself!!! 

We are originally from Sewickley and have made The Sewickley Café a favorite for celebrations and funeral luncheons when we are back in town. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"THIS IS A MUST GO TO PLACE.  A friend brought me there for the first time a little over a month ago.  I was skeptical at first, but I was so amazed by not only the quality of the food, but the EXCEPTIONAL quality of staff.  I have dined in five star restaurants around the world, this place runs with the big dogs!  No doubt about it..

I have not had a bad thing yet, and even become a bit adventuresome in my eleven visits so far.  I highly recommend the tomato dill soup.  It is by far the best tomato soup I have ever had!  It is lick the bowl good."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 6:30 on a Tuesday night.   The three of us sat at the bar and had a drink.  We were seated by the bartender around 7PM.  There were quite a few empty tables.  We sat there for 15 minutes before we even recognized by the waitress and got a menu!   Finally got some water, no bread is served.   It took another 10 minutes for us to get our salad.  There was one waitress for the entire restaurant flying around there.  She did the best she could.  There were three cooks and one bartender/host.  The waitress informed us that last week she was the only one again serving the whole restaurant.   We finally got our food.  It was just okay.   They were good size portions.  The desserts were nothing to write home about.   I got the tiramisu torte.  If you're looking for a tradition tiramisu, this is more like a cake.  Someone else got the carrot cake.  It was huge and good.  

The service was terrible and from what I heard from the waitress, sounds like they are always under staffed.  Poor management!   Usually bartenders are quite friendly.  This guy had the personality of a brick!   

We had actually expected to eat at the Naked Grape, as we know the service is spot on there, but they are closed for awhile.  Darn!  So we opted for here.  I won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went tonight.  Nice place to sit outside-and had amazing crab cakes.  Reason not 5 stars is first couple things we ordered they were out of for the day.  

Overall, give it a try.  Worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Have eaten lunch here about 3 times in the last couple months and really enjoyed it every time! Will definitely be returning. Warning: dessert portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Recently had lunch at the Sewickley cafe.  I had reasonable expectations of the place, considering its location and atmosphere. Unfortunately, I had a less than satisfactory experience with the food at the cafe.  I ordered a coconut shrimp salad, expecting a refreshing, yet filling and enjoyable meal. However, I was greeted with a less than acceptable plate of half rotten lettuce, and I mean the real rotten, slimy kind. I made it known to the waitress, who in all fairness, wasn't at fault in this situation. She didn't even consider making the issue known to the manager or the chef, who was actually to blame.  My complaint about the low quality of the food was completely ignored.  To say the least, I won't be returning to the cafe any time soon, and it is quite a shame, because, as I have said, the location and atmosphere isn't bad at all.  Just the lack of pride and consideration in their own business."}
{"text":"the Cafe has both a high end feel and a relaxed atmosphere.  It has a great reasonable lunch menu with great soups.  Depends on the time when you go there but its a nice relaxed restaurant with good service."}
{"text":"Went to the Sewickley Cafe today for a late lunch (2:30p) and was very disappointed. We sat for 20 minutes before a waiter stopped at our table, then waited another 30 minutes before the food arrived. The waiter apologized for the delay saying they had to make more of the tomato dill soup (??). How can you make soup in 30 minutes?! It was very obvious that someone had opened a can of chopped tomatoes and dumped them into the remaining soup, the result was terrible. The rest of the food was okay, certainly not up to what I expected based on the reviews I'd read of the cafe. I will not be recommending this cafe. Too bad since the menu was very appealing."}
{"text":"We went to Sewickley Cafe for Mother's Day Brunch and it was one of worst meals I've ever eaten for $25 a head we could not
have been more disappointed.  Fried chicken sitting out on a tray - no tongs for the chicken or the hodge podge of stale and tasteless desserts.  It was all buffet style.  Soggy salad, the fried chicken on a tray was greasy and when I tried to cut into it grease shot onto my blouse and blazer.  The worst eggs I've ever had - the texture was completely off - as if water was added.  A puddle of grease was below the bacon, the sausage was all pink in the middle.  Overcooked soggy penne pasta.  We had a large party and spent over $300 for the worst meal of our lives.  Our family isn't a bunch of complainers so we paid our bill and left extremely disappointed and hungry.  When we got back to our place - we didn't have much to offer and had to cook frozen chicken nuggets and we all tore up the nuggets and ice cream.   Everyone commented on how good our frozen nuggets were (whole foods 365 brand) compared to what we had just tried to eat.  My husband said the shrimp cocktail was good.  For what we paid we could have gone to the Grand Concourse.  Awful food and ridiculously over priced."}
{"text":"Arrived for a reservation on time....owner says small delay, go up the street for drinks, we'll call you. We returned 45 minutes later...our table still not ready, yet all people in very busy lobby were seated. When I said we were leaving, owner said, and I quote, \" we obviously don't need your business\". We ...had been there dozens of times before without issue. This one time, we had our African-American friend with us, and could not get seated. Coincidence? We think not. We'll never go back."}
{"text":"I honestly think prison cafeterias would offer better service.   

I remember a couple years back the NY Times published a list of 200 things a good wait staff should never do.  I think our waiter was trying to check off all 200 during this visit....   

This used to be a pretty decent standby for straightforward cafe fare at reasonable prices.  But our experience this past time was marred by stupefying, comically unprofessional service the likes of which I've seen maybe once or twice in my lifetime.  No need to drag out the particulars but we were one of two tables in the place (needed to grab a bite for late lunch around 4:15 so naturally it wasn't packed), and our order was inexplicably forgotten, then incorrect, and then brought out at insane intervals, then incorrect again.  

I'm not particularly fussy, so getting an order wrong or ill-timed isn't going to ruin my day.  What ruined it was the astonishing rudeness from the staff at every point in the meal.  Picture an appetizer half-finished perhaps 2 minutes after it was brought out....\"are you done with that?\".....well, no, it's half still there and we just got it, so no.  Then again on the main course, \"you guys done? Can I bring the check?\"  It's not like we were dawdling, we just got the dishes because they had been messed up repeatedly.  

This was truly a rare experience in many years of restaurant-going.  If I was one to throw a fit then this would've been an epic one.

***EDIT - The Cafe's owner contacted me and was genuinely very nice in responding to my disappointing experience this past weekend.  I appreciated the honest response and, based on prior good experiences here, I'll revise the score to three stars until I head back another time."}
{"text":"I've been to the Sewickley Cafe multiple times.  One of my mother's friends likes to frequent there often, but recently the service has really been slipping.  
This week, we went there for lunch and the place was virtually empty with only about a fourth of the tables inside occupied.  Even though they didn't have their hands full, the service moved at a snail's pace and offered very little concern for their customers.  
In concern of the food, it was fine, but as always the Sewickley Cafe is an expensive lunch.  In my opinion, it's a bit overpriced for what you get.  This last time their trademark tomato dill soup even was a bit off and had a very oily flavor.  My mother and I were really displeased with our past experience here."}
{"text":"Great potential but a miss. 

The price and food quality and atmosphere just don't match up with the staff and service. When I enter a restaurant I expect and experience that delivers on each of these metrics. The reality is the food is good, the price is fair, the atmosphere is quaint but the service and operations miss with under qualified wait staff and a poor guest service model. 

The host that greets you makes you think you're in for a treat as he welcomes you warmly, but once you are seated you find you become prisoner to a slow, unfriendly, unprofessional experience."}
{"text":"The first thing that comes to mind as I remember my lunch there on a Sat. are the flavors.  I flew out for a visit and by chance walked by and decided to stop.  For my first eating experience in Pittsburgh, I was delighted to know that there were good quality restaurants since I know I have a bias growing up in California.

The Sewickley Cafe is a quaint place.  It looked like families and their grandparents liked to stop in and eat on a Sat. afternoon.  There is interesting artwork and if you get a chance, try to sit near the window if you like people watching.

I had the Sausage Eggplant which although it was a little on the oily side with the sandwich dressing and the sausage, was still very good.  I don't think the bread was made-the-same-day fresh, but it was still pretty soft and delicious.  It was the perfect amount of bread to filling sandwich ratio.  My husband had the chicken pesto sandwich I got a tiny bite to try which was good, but he liked it so much he wouldn't let me have it anymore.

Having a full sandwich was very filling, but I think I could have done with a small bowl of soup and a half sandwich at the time.  We ended up taking half of it back to the hotel for that nights dinner.

I would definitely go back and would recommend others trying the cafe."}
{"text":"The food is always good.  Deserts are awesome.  
Always been a good experience for me and my family."}
{"text":"The three of us had a reservation on a week night for 6:30. We sat at the bar and was finally seated at 7PM by the bartender. There were quite a few empty tables. We sat there which seemed like forever before we were even recognized by anyone. Finally the one and only waitress gave us a menu after we told here that no one has even came to the table. Then another 10 minutes to take our order and quite awhile to get our food which was pretty good. I have had better especially for the price they charge.
The waitress said she was the only one for the entire restaurant last week too so the under staffing must be pretty normal. She was doing the best she could. There were three cooks and one bartender/host. Seems like poor management to me.
And the bartender who seated us, usually bartenders are quite friendly. This guy had zero personality!
Sewickley Cafe is over priced and under staffed. I do not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I had the best lunch of my summer thus far here this past weekend, and I would be remiss to not make note of it. 

During my days living nearer to here, friends from work would occasionally talk me into doing lunch here.  One day, on a whim, I swapped my normal fries for the Truffle Fries. 

Have you ever seen a rainbow for the first time after seeing in black and white for your entire life? That is the closest thing I can come up with to describe what happend to me. The flavor starts out subtly but builds and builds, slowly waking your brain to the joy that is dancing across your palate until, as you finish your last fry you feel there is nothing that could stop you from getting a second order... not even a potato famine. 

We went there recently and I was devastated when i was told they were out of the little strings of perfection. Our waiter pulled some strings, and the owner (who happened to be working in the kitchen that afternoon) took pity of my broken heart and made it happen. 

Have you ever built something up a ton in your mind and then when you have it you hate it? That is the opposite of what happened here. These were the best fries I've had yet.

Also, I had the bacon blue burger. That is a burger with bacon and blue cheese (in case you missed the name) and it was AWESOME. I'm tired of places that try to be trendy by asking \"pink or no pink\" when you order a burger. I ordered it Medium, because this place does it right. No gimicks, no schtick... just awesome tasty lunch.

My girlfriend had the Chicken Caesar wrap and I am told it was wonderful as well, and very large. I don't know first hand though, I was distracted in the puffy white clouds of lunch heaven."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this past weekend - and I am already craving it. Their steak salad with truffle fries was DIVINE. If you only order one thing, order that! The steak was a perfect medium rare and the fries were the right level of crisp. 

The mini crab cakes were also very good, and tasted fresh. We ordered the carrot cake for dessert and well, our table was quite loud in our adoration for it. And we are NOT carrot cake people. You MUST have a slice!"}
{"text":"I'm afraid the over-priced, mediocre food belies the interesting menu, refined atmosphere and attractive outdoor seating. In general we found the meals poorly prepared and rather uninspired. The service is good, however."}
{"text":"Have tried this restaurant numerous times over the past year, each time thinking that it will get better but it doesn't. Food is unspectacular and service is spotty. Actually had the manager turn us away for a table of 4 saying he had reservations all night only to walk by an hour later to a still empty restaurant. Patio is lovely . Too bad because it could be do good. I would cut the menu in half and be more creative. The staff is always fabulous. Just wish the food was more flavorful."}
{"text":"Awesome little cafe in Sewickley. I've been here for lunch a number of times. The sandwiches are great and all of ingredients taste fresh. It's a little expensive but worth the price. Also the desserts are incredible. The cheesecake is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the food at the Sewickley Cafe is always excellent, including my most recent trip.  That said, my most recent visit was extremely disappointing. The restaurant has taken a turn for the worse when it comes to cleanliness. The wood flooring and carpet is caked with grease and dirt and is sticky to walk on, the kitchen area is filthy with grease stains running down the stainless steel hood above the cook top, the smell of old grease lingers through the air, and the bathrooms are completely filthy.  It was such a shame to see that I mentioned these items to the waiter - he didn't seem to care.  Hopefully this review will open their eyes to changes that must be made."}
{"text":"We  had breakfast/brunch here  on a Sunday about 1pm.   Many of the other places in town were either closed or very crowded so we popped in here and asked if they served breaksast.. after a YES.. we were seated by the host/waiter. He was a bit slow but it wasn't horrible. We ordered an egg hash brown meal and an omelette( custom) .  Our meals arrived  in abour 20 minutes- there were 3 other tables while we were there. The next table had lunch and one gentleman ordered a lobster sandwich which looked huge.  We overheard him complain it was dry and bland though.   My omelette( spinach, feta and bacon) was a bit dry also.   My husband LOVED the rye bread and was pretty sure it was homemade.

 When you walk in there is a HUGE display case of HUGE desserts- we decided to  take some home.  Husband ordered a death by chocolate cake and I ordered the carrot cake.. UMM WOW.. they both  were at least 3 serving sizes and  super super good. In fact so good I would  go back  just for dessert. Did I mention I do not normally care for carrot cake? It was moist,  the icing creaming and full of flavor. The  DBC was  also moist and had just the right flavor."}
{"text":"Eating on the back patio is a must!   There is a great atmosphere out there and it's covered so you are in the shade.  I find the inside a little dark, so my preference is to eat outside.  

Service for lunch was great and our waiter was really attentive.   What gets me everytime about this cafe, is the menu.   As I read through it, everything sounds delicious.  Asiago - artichoke grilled cheese, count me in!   Raspberry walnut chicken salad, yum!    The problem is in the execution of the meal.   Everything that I'm so excited to try on the menu, is just ok when I order it.   The food is good, it just never quite meets or exceeds my expectations."}
{"text":"During lunch recently, the waiter was nice to my husband and me, but he did not ask us if we wanted to order drinks. He automatically brought us water and never brought us any refills. The sandwiches that my we ordered tasted OK but were a bit greasy."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be great but after many attempts, I can honestly say that the quality has gone down the hill through the years. This week, a group of 4 had lunch, 2 people had to send back their tomato dill soup because it was too creamy and lacked all flavor. Another diner had chicken with rice soup that looked and tasted like oatmeal. My salad was wilted and my friends chips were crumbles on her plate. It is so disappointing because the atmosphere and menu are wonderful but we will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"This is an updated review. I've been back twice for lunch In the past couple months. Either they got a new chef or he got rid of the extra salt. Awesome place for lunch so I'm giving them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place on a Saturday evening and really enjoyed the food, service and ambiance. The macadamia nut crusted tilapia was delicious as well as the tomato dill soup."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time yesterday. The food was amazing. The Italian nachos are a must. Also, the staff was very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"What ambiance!  Food is divine.  Tomato dill is legendary.  One of Pittsburgh's best now relegated to a steakhouse.  Really?"}
{"text":"Truffle fries are to die for!!!! The Crosby wraps are amazing as well.  Love the food here, my boyfriend and I always buy lunch here! Never gets old!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. Unfortunately the best part of going there was their brunch which they no longer serve."}
{"text":"Always a great meal at the Sewickley Cafe.  I am not a big Tomato Soup fan but I love the Tomato Dill Soup.  And the deserts??  Honestly, some of the slices of cake are so tall that I'm shocked Highmark or UPMC haven't asked to attach letters to the top of them!  Good stuff."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant.  We love the atmosphere outside and in the outdoor tent if the weather is nice.   They also have a great take-out casserole deal that we have enjoyed picking up and taking home on the busy nights.  Check out their cafe casseroles at http://www.sewickley-cafe.com/cafeCasseroles.php."}
{"text":"We decided to go in for a late Saturday afternoon hoping to dine on the patio. Unfortunately, it was reserved for a wedding, but we were okay with the dining room. The cafe is fairly small with an open kitchen, only about 15 or 20 tables and a small bar area. We got a table towards the back. 

Jim got a Hoegaarden and I had ice tea. We decided to share a mini crab cakes appetizer. We got 6 small cakes, which were very good. I got a Coconut Shrimp Salad, with coconut shrimp, mixed greens, avocado, tomato, mandarin oranges, almonds and scallions with mango ginger vinaigrette. It was very good. Jim had a Steak Ciabatta, grilled sirloin steak with banana peppers, tomato, cheddar cheese and roasted shallot mayonnaise. He thought that if it weren't for the banana peppers, it wouldn't have much flavor. It was served with a choice of side and he picked onion rings. They were hand battered and delicious.  For dessert, we shared a pear port tart. It was very good. Our server was very nice and added to the fun.  All in all, a nice meal."}
{"text":"I've been to the Sewickley Cafe numerous times. I really like the entire menu--it's unique. Some of the offerings aren't what you can find at similar establishments. I really like the atmosphere as well. The interior has a historic/cozy feel. If the weather is nice, the patio is beautiful. Anytime I am up near Sewickley, this is definitely on the top of my list for dining."}
{"text":"Came here for a wedding rehearsal dinner so the appetizers and dinner were served buffet style.  It was held outside under a white tent.  Nice stone man mand pond and mini waterfall, very nice.  There was just enough room for our dinner party.

Overall I would say this place is decent.  Probably not a place I would come to if I only had a limited time in the area to visit.

Some appetizers that were served:
MINI CRABCAKES --not bad, to be fair, I have had great crabcakes in MD
CHICKEN SKEWERS w/RASPBERRY sauce --alright, I didn't keep reaching for them
FRESH FIG w/GOAT or FETA cheese --didnt try it
CHEESE and FRESH FRUIT platters

DINNER:
PINEAPPLE, BACON, Salad --A-OK

CESAR SALAD --good

SALMON ( glaze tasted like BBQ) --not a fan of the flavor profile but the fish preparation is pretty good considering how easy fish can be overcooked and its being served in a large metal casserole for a buffet.

STEAK (w/burgundy mushrooms?) --I normally don't reach for just a piece of beef but this dish was probably the best of the proteins.  Prepared wonderfully too.  Not red but not overdone.

A CHICKEN dish I cannot recall

CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE for dessert.  Not a true souffle.  More like a chocolate lava cake.  Not a big fan of, I am a huge baker and sweets snob so my critique is probably harsher."}
{"text":"Sequel let cafe is now Closed as of 9/23/15.  So sad...no more truffle fries or tomato dill soup."}
