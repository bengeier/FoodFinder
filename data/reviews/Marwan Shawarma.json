{"text":"I was walking around this area and was craving for shawarma. I walked in and it was a tiny place. The man who served me was really friendly and always had something to talk about.   I got two chicken shawarma wrap and I was very disappointed. It tasted plain. I should acknowledge that it was around 5 bucks for the two wraps, but it wasn't worth it. They were also tiny! There wasn't as much filling in the wrap as I have tried in other places. Even my brother thought it was nothing special.   When it comes to food, I'm really picky about how clean the restaurant is. I observed the same thing as what geraldine had saw! The man had no sense of sanitization. When I entered, it was empty and the man was on the phone. Since i entered, he hung up to serve me. But, he did not wash his hands or anything before making my wrap. He made one and then went to the register for me to pay before he made my second one. Again, he did not wash his hands or wear gloves before making my wrap.   I told a friend about this incident and my friend shared that the man also did the same to her! Touching the wraps with uncleaned hands! Maybe his conversation is a way to distract you from noticing these things....  I will never return back to this location. Ali Baba is just down the street if you are REALLLY craving for shawarma."}
{"text":"Man, I love Marwan!  The guy is quite the character, and has moved from location to location on Queen street.  His people follow him very loyally.  Best is his Kafta Kabob, which he makes himself, and is the best Kafta in Toronto IMO.  The guy has a lot of charm and will crack you a joke.  He calls almost anyone that is remotely close to his skin colour \"his Son\" and will always have a smile on his face.  Dude is cool and funny.  He really needs some bloody air conditioning in the summer.  Good place for a decent meal at a good price, and a good pick me up on any given day.  Great to spend your hard earned money on somebody who appreciates it, and gives you a pretty damn good meal!!!!"}
{"text":"Was wondering by and this was the only place open kinda late at night. Unfortunately, much of what they had on the limited menu was not available. Still, the food I had was good, though the help wasn't particularly helpful."}
{"text":"Yet another shawrama place on queen.  Their giant signs with unbelievable prices totally pulled me -  plus I was absolutely starving.  Hands down, the worst chicken shawarma plate I have had.  Why? The garlic sauce was sooo bitter. Anywhere he put that on my food - I couldn`t eat it.  The chicken was too dry and the sauce wasn`t helping.  But my biggest beef is cleanliness. Now, I tend to be a bit more flexible with small businesses trying to make their piece of the pie but gosh -please follow  healthier food handling practices.  I walked in while he was talking to his wife. She left so he could serve me. He had finished taking some cash then took my order. There he proceeded to put rice into my styrofoam dish then tamp it down with HIS UNWASHED HAND.  My stomach just turned inside out.  I had no idea what to do. Do I tell him? I was just in shock.    It took me awhile to try the food.  I think of people who can`t afford to even go here and buy anything so I sucked it up and tried it. Well, it wasn`t worth the agony.  The biggest plus to this place is the price. You get a hefty portion of food for a small price. I cannot argue with that.  However with so many places on this street,  I am glad to say I can walk buy and not wonder any more."}
