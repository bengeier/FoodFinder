{"text":"This diner is a great place for brunch. We got the steak quesadilla it was very very good. We also got the B-Bop, an egg, ham and cheese sandwich on a bagel. Wish the cheese was melted but besides that it was good. You also get a lot for your money.   The service is also extremely friendly and nice! Really enjoyed the people there!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best diners I have been to. Great service. Shawn is very nice on-the-ball. Honestly all of their food is delicious, however, my favorite is the steak omelet with Gouda cheese and their powdered raspberry donuts are out of this world!"}
{"text":"I love this little place! It's great in the summer due to the outdoor seating. I go for breakfast since I'm not a huge donut fan, but their donut selection is decent and you can win a free one if you answer the trivia question of the day correctly.   Service is always fast and portions are neither too big nor too small (although I fill up quick so I might be biased). They serve your typical greasy spoon diner food, which is exactly what I'm looking for when I go out to breakfast. Everything also seems to use butter or margarine... none of that 50% canola oil stuff I've seen places using lately."}
{"text":"Service on weekend mornings is not great.  The hold up seems to be in the kitchen.  Trying to find the perfect way to get my eggs runny for toast dipping but not slimy.  Ordered over easy and they're slimy, but ordered medium and the yolks are a little hard.  Breakfast comes with one slice of toast but if you want one more slice, it's 70 cents -- a little steep I think for one slice of bread."}
{"text":"Yum! Good corned beef hash, great donuts. A good, old-fashioned diner."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and the staff is great. Love the fun donuts and the Katie's Kitchen Sink is the best! It's great for dining in and to-go orders."}
{"text":"I have just recently tried Stownut Donut for breakfast and I am hooked!!! What a fantastic spot. The decor  is adorable, the staff is incredibly friendly and the food is wonderful. On my first visit I had the Stownut stacker - delicious!!! I was there yesterday and had an incredible veggie omelet.  I cannot wait to go back for lunch!  And a side note to Mad M's review - I happened to be sitting at the counter witnessing  the encounter you spoke of in your review. There are two sides to every story - the \"middle aged blonde\" you wrote about is the owner - if you had been going there for over a year you would know that - as she introduced herself to me as she was making sure everything about my visit was fine. Also, she stepped into the encounter after you raised your voice to the staff member. I applaud her for protecting her staff from unnecessary abuse. Too sum it all up Stownut is a great spot - I am glad I stumbled upon it and I will definitely be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to have brunch with friends. I thought the pictures reminded me of a donut place i loved in NYC so we tried Stownut. Great choice! everyone was happy with their meals. Prices were good, and the decor is diner-rific. I'll be returning for sure. We got donuts for the ride home. delicious bonus!!"}
{"text":"Great donuts. Lousy food. I came in here due to a severe jelly donut craving (and I can't stand large chain store donuts that come frozen in a box before you eat them). So, being in the area I Googled donuts and this place popped up. I got a raspberry jelly donut which was delicious. When I ordered lunch, I discovered many lunch items were not available which either means they're so good they can't keep them in stock or the kitchen is poorly run. I ended up with a Sloppy Joe sandwich which was just awful. It came with cheese on top that was hard and appeared to have been sitting out. The bun was burned and the macaroni salad was the strangest of all: it had nearly whole eggs in it and was pure mayonaise. I ate about half and had to quit. So, in short, I would say go for the donuts and not the food in my experience."}
{"text":"I drive past this place all the time and finally stopped in.  There are 2 things I have to try at any diner I visit, pancakes and burgers.  On this visit I had pancakes and sausage.  They were very tasty and the coffee was quite good.  Our waitress was very friendly and the place had a 50's feel.  I will most definitely visit again for a burger soon."}
{"text":"When I first entered I was hope full, while small it was quaint. Within a minute I had received my coffee, but when I wasn't ready to order immediately a server didn't come back again for quite some time. The coffee was poor, I can get a better cup at Speedway. The food while well priced was of poor quality. For a similar but better diner experience go to Islay's on 59. Now Stownuts does serve donuts, which Islay's does not but they are of similar quality to Walmart bakery donuts. If you want better donuts in the area visit Jubilee's Donut on 59. If you are alright with chains, most Dunkin Donut locations have a drive-thru and offer better coffee, donuts and service than Stownuts does.  I don't know where Stownuts fits in, it doesn't do anything better than other breakfast locations in the area, and it doesn't do them cheaper. I won't be visiting Stownuts again, their quality isn't worth my time or dollar. On top of places already mentioned within a couple miles of are the Wild Goat Cafe and the Blue Door Cafe and Bakery which offer wonderful experiences, that shouldn't even be compared to my Stownuts experience."}
{"text":"Loved this little unpretentious, family owned place!  The prices are very reasonable, the food is great, and the service is friendly, fast, and attentive. They don't serve prefab food like a chain restaurant. Karen (the owner and cook) has an excellent instinct for the little subtleties and nuances that make food tasty and  satisfying.  They are especially well known for their handmade Polish perogies, available frozen for take home or cooked up and served right there, made from scratch from an heirloom family recipe. Karen (the owner and cook) handmakes these tasty little clouds of goodness just the way her mom, Carol from Poland, did it.  Let me tell you they are AWESOME.  That's why they practically fly out the door, because they are THAT good.  My husband particularly loves the homemade biscuit with sausage gravy.  The potatoes are REAL potatoes, not reheated frozen stuff.  And to top it off, when you walk in, you're treated like they are happy to see you. A special shout out to Mike, Karen's son and waiter, who is just as friendly and attentive as can be.   The thing is, I eat out a lot.  I spent years traveling all over the country and many parts of the world, so I've eaten in a lot of places.  When I went into this place, I was really touched by how their food is prepared.  I was so impressed, within a half hour I knew all their names and why it was so good.  You can really taste the love and pride of heritage in those perogies.  Stownut Donut is the complete package: good food,  homey atmosphere, friendly and professional service, kid friendly, and the price is right. UPDATE: When this review was first posted, the biscuit had been served each time we ordered it with a traditional savory cream gravy and it was great.  Well, things have changed.  We returned in August 2014 and ordered the same thing again, but this time it was radically different from before; the gravy was watery and revoltingly sweet, not at all a traditional sausage cream gravy.   The diner took it off the bill for us, which we appreciated.  When I asked Karen, the owner and cook, about it, she adamantly asserted that the cloying super sweetness was the natural result of heating good cream.     Listen to me, Karen.    No.   A thousand times,  No.   That's not correct and every cook knows that, and I think you do, too.  If that were true, then every freshly made Alfredo sauce would turn out as super sweet as that gravy.  So, diners, they still have friendly service and great perogies. If you like the change to super sweet sausage gravy, then you'll be happy.  If not, then I suggest you try another place.  Sorry. Stownut Donut.  Result: DEMOTION."}
{"text":"I discovered this place on my trip to Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The servers were friendly and the breakfast was tasty and inexpensive. I will be back the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. Definitely nothing fancy about the place but the food was good and the service was great. Good basic breakfast at a reasonable price. The donuts are great! I'll be back and add this place to my breakfast list."}
{"text":"Tried this place randomly last Sunday and the food was hot, fresh, tasty, and cheap! I had the breakfast stack and my boyfriend had the eggs benedict. Both meals were very tasty and hot. Coffee was great. The owner and staff were friendly. I'd definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Stownut has a decent breakfast menu with reasonable prices, but the food isn't necessarily anything special. I got an omelet and it wasn't any better or worse than something you'd get at Bob Evans. The waitstaff was friendly, though and we try to support locally owned establishments, so we'll probably be back."}
{"text":"I just came up and got breakfast/lunch... Wanted to offer some feedback. My daughter ordered breakfast... The #3. French toast. It was really good. She devoured it. I got the chicken potpie with Great anticipation.... Bcuz that's one of my favs in life. That and country fried steak n eggs. Lol. The potpie'a crust was amazing. Very flaky. And abundant. If I may offer a tiny hint of advice.... It would of been the bomb dot com---- if--- the gravy/insides wld have matched (the amount) of dough. Don't get me wrong -- because she's on point with the amount of dough. Normally that's what is lacking in a pot pie. However-- it was a tad dry and I really would of loved more \"gravy\". Maybe next time I will order a side of gravy with it and it will be .. Perfection :))"}
{"text":"I visited here for the first time last week and was impressed. It has an adorable interior that really gives it an old time feel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The food came out within  a good time. The menu isn't huge, but there are good options. I didn't try their donuts this time, but next time I will for sure. They looked delish. I love how they have a question of the day, where if you answer the question correct you can get a free donut. It's a cute little place you should visit once."}
{"text":"I was in Stow on business and wasn't really feeling a chain restaurant for breakfast. Luckily, Yelp directed me to Stownut. It's a cute little diner that looks like something right out of the 50s (discounting the SpongeBob memorabilia in the corner, of course). I had Katie's Kitchen Sink Biscuits and Gravy, and it did not disappoint. I grew up in the South, so I'm really particular about mine, but the folks at Stownut now how to whip them up real good. The owner and the servers were very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I go there almost every weekend since I discovered it. If you want a good breakfast done right and want your coffee filled every 5 minutes then you'll like this place. If you're going there for the first time try the corn beefed hash, it's delicious. Don't forget to grab a donut too they're always great."}
{"text":"This is a very good, little place tucked away in a strip mall in Stow. They're known for their delicious donuts, but I planned to go there for a simple breakfast, since I'm gluten-free.   They had gluten free blueberry muffins!! So delicious. Tasted like a normal muffin. O so moist and bluberry-y.   Ate half my muffin and then ordered coffee, 2 eggs, and hash browns with cheese. The eggs were a little runny (ordered them over-medium), but the whole thing was rather tasty. Lots of cheese on the hash browns. Got all it all (muffin, eggs, hash browns, coffee) for 9.02.   The donuts looked delicious, though I couldn't have any of them. Their flavors range from regular glazed, sour cream, jelly,  chocolate eclair, etc., to specialties like s'mores and trix cereal."}
{"text":"Just another fun spot!  The breakfast there are good and the decor you just look at for days. Very fun for a date."}
{"text":"This is an awesome, cheap family diner! Such nice people run the place and they're very good for what they do. It's basic stuff - bagel with egg and cheese, omelettes, egg salad, soup, etc. Good diner food that comes out decently quickly. The donuts are also very tasty and there is always a trivia question for a free donut if you get it right!"}
{"text":"We went there today for the first time. The food was awesome ! They warned us of a wait very nicely and we decided to stay. We got seated right away and ordered cream sticks and coffee which we got very quickly and they were both very very good.  We ordered breakfast and it was worth the wait. The food is homemade and delicious. The place is clean even the bathroom which is important to me. We had great service and can't wait to go again next weekend."}
{"text":"This is a great little dinner tucked away in Stow. The service can be a little to desired but that depends on the time of day. Come early, great service. Come an hour or closer to closing, they are angry they have to wait on you.   Donuts are great but variety goes quick. We come for the breakfast pizza- be prepared to wait, it's made fresh right there but it's SO worth it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a home town diner this is your place! Super cute atmosphere- Great diner food! Have never received bad service and even my special request for breakable(burnt) bacon always comes out as I like it!"}
{"text":"This place was tiny inside but super cute. We went with intentions of donuts and coffee and hopefully a small table to sit, I didn't realize they actually served hot food also. Naturally, we got our donuts and coffee...plus a bacon egg and cheese bagel and an order of eggs Benedict. Everything was tasty and all of that for $20 before tip. I see a return trip in our future. Cookies and cream donut was DELISH! Next on my list is definitely Smores..."}
{"text":"We started out meal with a yummy apple fritter and piping hot coffee. The staff was friendly and the decor made it feel like a old time diner. A friend had recommended the corned beef hash and it was the best I've ever had. The corned beef is homemade, tender, and full of flavor! Katie's Kitchen Sink was also fantastic, the biscuits and gravy (which are also homemade) did not disappoint. Overall, it was a great breakfast spot and we'll be back again."}
{"text":"The BEST in town!  From the unique doughnuts, homemade favorites and service it's a must visit.  Never had anything on the menu I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"First time here, we sat out on the patio.   Our server was prompt and friendly.    I ordered the Stownut stacker and 1 bite in was AMAZING!!!   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Low key on weekday mornings but on weekend eating inside is a bust and bad choice. HUGE donuts though and amazing pastries. Fast service. Honestly best breakfast around."}
{"text":"We're from the Cleveland area and we're down here for a wedding and needed a good breakfast the next morning and couldn't have picked a better place! Food was amazing, people were amazing. Donuts were excellent as was all of our different dishes... Probably going to make the drive down here once in awhile for more good food and company!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Get the coffee. I don't know what it is but that in itself is enough to make you come back and get a sandwich, donut, and large coffee for around $7. I'd pay that any day for a homemade breakfast sandwich over a McDonalds meal that will cost you just as much."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and unique variety of donuts for a diner like this! I also got a free donut by guessing the trivia question of the day correctly. I ordered a veggie breakfast quesadilla with tons of vegetables, which I normally would've loved, but it got a little soggy in the end. Next time I will try one of the meat varieties! I tried and trix and strawberry glazed donuts, both of which I loved."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, friendly staff, retro atmosphere, best donuts I've found so far."}
{"text":"I've had the corned beef breakfast here before that a friend brought me and it was absolutely amazing so I went in for lunch today and got the rib eye Philly. Such a good lunch. The sandwich was by far one of the best I've ever had and the homemade macaroni salad was so good. I was told that the wait was a little longer here and to expect that so I did. Karen was great and the wait was actually perfect for timing to have lunch. The food here is delicious and I would highly recommend eating in or calling for carry out!"}
{"text":"Somewhere in my search for all things delicious in and near Akron, I found Stownut, a cool little diner tucked away in a strip mall.  I went first thing in the morning to get a couple fresh donuts (I read they can go quickly) and was greeted by two lovely ladies behind the counter in front of a colorful display case.    I grabbed a menu on the way out and nearly started to cry that I hadn't planned to stay there for breakfast.  The donuts were good, but I saw some amazing offerings like breakfast pizza and the kitchen sink.  While those donuts were simply amazing, I would not hesitate to drive from Pittsburgh for that breakfast pizza."}
{"text":"They have AMAZING breakfast! I have been back many a times and gotten different items and have never been disappointed! Eggs, sausage gravy and biscuits, omelets, so many options besides just donuts but their donuts are delicious too. I will be back many times still to try other things yet."}
{"text":"We've been patronizing this little place for over a year, and have always enjoyed their laid back attitude, and 60's musical hits.  The food was decent as well, with generous portions.  We had never been in there during the week until yesterday, when the server couldn't seem to understand what I wanted to order, despite being told several times.  He ended up charging for a toast that he said, in response to my question, was gratis with the order.  When I tried to explain to the middle aged blonde woman that cashed us out that I shouldn't have to pay for the toast, she was rude, condescending, and accusatory, defending the server and accusing me of yelling at him.  At no point did I yell at anyone.  Frustrated yes. Yelling no.  Bottom line: there are too many restaurants out there where you can get good food and great service.  I don't need to be treated in such a rude and inconsiderate manner by staff and won't go there ever again.  So, they got my $2.29 for toast but they won't get another penny of my money or the people I'm going to tell about this.  Shame on you Stownut!"}
{"text":"Always amazing!! Best local breakfast in town!! It's always a little busy and it's a smaller establishment but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Although I am not a police officer, nor do I belong to the fraternal order of police, I give to their yearly fundraisers and support their efforts.This somehow afflicts me with having a strange attraction towards round, cream filled pucks of risen and fried dough. Combine that with an already strange recurring need for pork of all kinds, bacon in particular, and I just had to give the Stownut Donut & Diner a try!  The Lobster Benedict caught my eye. No bacon, but I am trying to work on my addictions, and lobster is a good place to start. Overall, the dish was okay. The lobster meat was still cool but It did have some decent flavor, the hollandaise sauce stayed together and cutting through the dish I found the eggs atop were still a little runny. Not bad. The touch with the spinach was nice. I did end up trying the bacon and it had a good flavor and was meaty enough to pass for something other than nitrate covered cellophane.   Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the meal was the potatoes. The inconsistent cut made the larger pieces quite firm with the smaller ones being just about right. The pancakes were a bit too bread-like for my taste.  The service I received was good and, yes, I tried the donuts! The glazed delights are a good size with great flavor and the bavarian cream in some of them is quite nice, indeed!   So, if you ever find yourself involved in a multi-jurisdictional popo-paluza and need a distraction that'll keep the bears off your tail, take a swing by Stownut. The combination of the donuts and the bacon will not only save yours, it might actually get you an invitation to the ball!  facebook.com/foodiepebbles"}
{"text":"I love Yelp for showing me great local spots that I might not otherwise check out. This was one of those!  Stownut is both a donut shop AND a diner...so of course we ate breakfast AND ordered donuts.   I order Katie's Kitchen Sink - hash browns topped with  split biscuit, 2 eggs and sausage gravy. AH- MAZING. Hubs ordered just some basic eggs with home fries...these are bigger cubes of seasoned Potatoes- and they were really good.  We for a couple maple donuts to go - even though they had some \"out there\" options like Oreo, Snickers and Froot Loops. So good. My card smelled like love the whole way home.  A) Go for a meal. Yum. B) Dont be distracted by the major chain donut place in the parking lot. Just. Keep. Driving. Trust me. I never lie about donuts."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here last week and it was great.  I sat at the counter, but they had tables available too at 10:00am on a weekday.  Service was very good as well."}
{"text":"Great prices, good is very good, fast service, you cannot beat this small restaurant. also, very clean and neat, very friendly service. Tom Dean Hudson, Ohio"}
{"text":"In search of blueberry waffles and today's visit didn't disappoint. Our meal was made even better by sitting outside."}
{"text":"Anyplace that has fresh donuts, super crispy bacon and uses real eggs (not that crap out the carton) is Aces with me!"}
{"text":"Never had anything like the Kitchen Sink before, amazing. It's like layered hash browns/biscuits/eggs/sausage gravy. The '50s theme seems authentic & they're busy when they open at 6:30am. Would go again."}
{"text":"Stownut is an outstanding local diner that makes A plus Donuts. The maple cream sticks are a local specialty and are delicious!  It is well worth a stop.  There's outdoor seating.    If you are traveling in the Akron area with children, stop here for breakfast before heading to the playground that's a hop skip up the road on Fishcreek.  Bring your tricycles. Your kids will think you are awesome for this!"}
{"text":"It was ok. My waffle was good, the coffee was not. If you're looking for coffee and donuts there's a Dunkin' Donuts in the same shopping center that's just as good and probably cheaper, if you're looking for a diner I'd go to Johnny's Diner in Hudson, better food, better service."}
{"text":"Speedy service with a smile! Very glad this recommendation popped up while visiting Stow. I enjoyed the S'mores donut and my boyfriend tried a Sloppy Joe omelet. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and owners are just the start of an amazing experience! The eggs Benedict... Oh goodness. The best around. A great way to start the day. Food always comes out the way you want it; the hashbrowns are just the right amount of crispy, the yolks runny, the pancakes fluffy, and the coffee just strong enough.  Not just donuts by any means... Those are for taking home when the experience is over! If you've not been here... The only question I can ask is... Why not?"}
{"text":"Great family-run business.  Corned beef hash, donuts, and eggs Benedict as good as you can get.  Fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 dozen assorted doughnuts & muffins for my staff meeting. I provided Stownut only 24 hours notice, & they sure delivered! I was able to pay in advance, the muffins/doughnuts were ready promptly @ 7:30am as I requested, & their staff carried my order out to my car! They are also very reasonably priced. For right around $40 you get 3 dozen giant fresh muffins & doughnuts. Our staff raved about how good, fresh & how wonderful the pastries smelled. Thank you Stownut we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Yes!!! We moved here from NC a few years ago and couldn't find a spot that had that small town feel we were used to, this place has it! The staff is so friendly, great conversation, even better food. Everything we have had here, from donuts to dinners, has been well worth every penny. If we moved back to NC I would drive back just for this place! Om nom nom nom"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! My boyfriend and I ate there for the first time today. It's a cozy, old-fashioned diner with vintage Coke signs and Elvis Presley decorations and the typical black and white checkered tile floor. I had a delicious breakfast bagel sandwich with cheese, egg, and tomato accompanied with delicious, homemade home fries. My boyfriend got the Garden Omelet that was made with fresh veggies and very tasty! They also have nice outdoor seating if you feel like the inside is too small. On the way out, we bought a Trix donut and a chocolate whoopie pie from their homemade donut selection. We left about an hour until close so most of their donuts were sold out - there was a sign for a S'mores donut that was all gone - can't wait to go back and try it!"}
{"text":"For those that gave great reviews for Stownut Donut & Diner, I'm not sure what they had. We stopped there on a Saturday around 1:00 for lunch. The place is not dirty but could use a little touch up. We were seated quickly and asked the server, who was pleasant, what was good since it was our first time there. She named some items and I decided, since it has the semi-appearance of a '50s diner, to order a burger. I asked if the fries were made fresh, since that's a prerequisite in a great diner and was surprised to hear that no, they were frozen. The server said the macaroni salad was made in house, so I went that route. I wasn't asked what temp. I wanted the burger, so that made me a little scared that it was frozen, too. The burger was edible but barely. The mac salad was pure mayo and not much else. My friend had the chicken sandwich special which she said was barely edible also.  The server was nowhere to be found for refills until we were almost completely done with our meal.   Maybe the great reviews before me are for the donuts, I don't know. But I'd stay away from here for lunch."}
{"text":"Their pancakes are addicting - especially the blueberry pancakes!! Great service as well! They are busy on weekend mornings, even at 8am, but totally worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"We're on vacation visiting Cuyahoga Valley National Park & we found this place on Yelp. It's our second visit in a week! We LOVE it! The donuts are so fresh & the homemade biscuit on my breakfast sandwich was amazing. Perfect perfect place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I grew up in the area, have lived near it for 3 years, but had yet been to Stownut!  My wife and I went on a Friday morning before work at 630am when they opened. Quaint little place that takes you back to the 1950s (or what I can imagine anyway). We each got the breakfast wrap with home fries and hash browns. It was delicious. Ended up splitting a half dozen of donuts for the work day. Extremely fresh and phenomenal.   Service was outstanding. Prices were great. Atmosphere was amazing. Definitely cannot wait to get back into this place for breakfast and/or lunch!   Great experience! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday. Ordered the Ruben sandwich! Was very good and the fries were hot and very good! Will go back and try breakfast next time!"}
{"text":"We must have gone here on a bad day.  I had read great reviews and brought people here to eat for breakfast.  Everything was cooked very poorly and tasted bad.  We were really hungry and not that picky, yet not one of us finished more than half our breakfast.  :("}
{"text":"We had been looking for a good breakfast spot and found this local spot on Yelp. Photos and reviews were good so we decided to try it out. It was such a nice surprise! Upon walking in we were greeted and told to seat ourselves, the table was clean, and the walls were decorated with 50's/retro memorabilia and Ohio license plates going as far back as 1916! Everyone working there was welcoming and happy to answer any questions about the menu. We ordered waffles, eggs (scrambled and over-medium), a waffle, bacon, a biscuit, hash browns, breakfast potatoes, coffee and a pink donut. Everything was fresh and delicious. Prices were extremely reasonable. The donut was the fluffy, not greasy, and the frosting had a great consistency, frankly it was the best donut I've had in Summit county. It is family owned, we got to meet the owners. They were so welcoming and added even more charm to this little diner in Stow. Overall a great experience, we will definitely become regulars now that we've found this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Bah.  Jubilee knocks them out of the water. Hell, Acme and Giant Eagle does as well."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy breakfast brunch spot, it's a diner! A great diner. The donuts are fresh and sinful. The breakfast is great diner food. I would like to try their lunch at some point. The decor screams nostalgia and the service is pretty good. Again, it's a diner! If you like diners, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Love this little hometown gem!  Fair prices. Good food. Great service.  Doughnuts are fresh and delicious. Quaint diner with a nostalgic feel."}
{"text":"Was a great lunch,  and the atmosphere very welcoming. Loved the place..Will visit again!"}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp because we were trying to decide between a donut place and a breakfast diner. To our surprise,  we discovered a place that served both! When we first walked in, we saw the showcase of donuts, including uniquities like the \"Trix Delight\" (yeast donut with Trix cereal on top). We chose to sit at the bar and enjoyed the company of the servers.  I started out with coffee  and we both shared a yeast donut with chocolate icing and sprinkles.  The yeast donuts here are larger and more substantial than your average Krispy Kreme yeast donut and quite good, they taste very fresh. She had a breakfast burrito which was 'delicious' with bacon that was 'on point'.  I had an eggs benedict which was very good, although I wish the Hollandaise had had chives.  Overall the service was very friendly, the food good, and it looks like we have definitely found a breakfast spot where we won't have to compromise."}
{"text":"Adorable diner style restaurant !!! Friendly staff and quick service! Donuts are amazing!"}
{"text":"Just tried their donuts this morning. delicious!!! Had the Trix cereal one and a bite of my husband's maple cream stick. Both were awesome."}
{"text":"As a salesman, I buy a lot of donuts for my customers. I like to spread the business around, especially to local and small businesses but I really can't recommend this place for its donuts. I ordered three dozen donuts for early morning pickup and everyone complained they were stale! I will not jeopardize business relationships again with this \"day old\" donut place."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here for the first time a couple of weeks a go. All the regular customers were friendly and greeted me when I walked in. Our waitress was kind and happy. She made sure our coffee cups were full. I had a made to order omelet. The food and coffee were delicious. I only give it 4 stars because everything cooked and covered in butter."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what to make of this restaurant... it certainly has character. I like the old diner feel to the place but the music is really annoying.  As for the food, meh. I ordered \"Katie's Kitchen Sink\" because it sounded pretty appetizing... 2 eggs layered over hash browns, biscuit, sausage gravy and topped with bacon. Unfortunately it was let down. Normal sausage gravy usually has a smoky taste and pieces of sausage in it, their 'sausage' gravy is just creamy and has no taste to it. Now what stopped me from eating my breakfast was the biscuit! I think... it's hard to tell because all mixed together. Somewhere in the mixture I could taste quite a bit of sugar, now just think about eating eggs, hash browns and bland sausage gravy mixed with sugar! Sounds disgusting, right?  I'm a big breakfast fan and I'm always looking for a place that cooks up something tasty, but this place was a real let down! Not to mention they are taking forever to take my plate & credit card (20 minutes and counting), and there are only 3 customers here! Did I mention the music is really annoying?? Plus the TV volume is up, so it's a true mesh of chaos!  ....I should stop with review but since they're taking FOREVER to take my credit card, I shall resume my rant. The aroma of this place is grease mixed with sugar, yummy!! Now I understand why this place is so empty.   I'm guessing my sever is the owner, Karen. She just passed me by again without taking my credit card... I could just walk to the counter and demand my bill but I want to see how long this takes (now 30 minutes). Did I mention the music is really annoying?   Hey! Here she comes again... dah, ignored again. My plate is pushed to the opposite side of the table with my napkin & silverware on top of my unfinished meal and my credit card is just sitting here... that's the international sign that I'm done!!   Meanwhile some customers walked in and sat down next to me... she helping them. That nice... and now she's gone. We're up to 40 minutes and counting. I was going to be kind with this review about an hour ago but this is ridiculous! Ah, here she comes again... she's helping the elderly couple next to me, now she's talking about her favorite comedian, that's cute. Annnnd there she goes.   How about that...  the elderly couple next to me came in, ordered, ate, she took their plates and their bill, and now they left. I've been here for an hour and a half! It's not a big place!!! I know what you're thinking, why don't I just demand my bill? That would be too easy. This woman needs to learn that.... wait... holy crap she took my plate!!!! Now let's start the timer for when she'll bring the bill.  I'm running out of things to say.   Ah screw it, I'm going to cave... this music is melting my brain. Time to pay the bill at the counter.  At least she said \"Have a good day!\". Don't get me wrong, Karen seems like a nice woman, just learn how to run a freaking restaurant.  Lesson learned."}
