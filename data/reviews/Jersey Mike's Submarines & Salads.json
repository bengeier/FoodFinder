{"text":"Phenomenal subs.  Loved the fact that the meat was cut right in front of me.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"After trying the Jersey Mike's in the South Hills we decided to try this one. The Big Kahuna was good but the  meatball was horrible. Service not as friendly as South Hills and no salads offered as sides as South Hills does. Needless to say we will stick with the South Hills store. I still gave them three stars for the Big Kahuna and for the generous Military discount."}
{"text":"I absolutely love jersey mikes subs. They are a bit more pricey than subway, but I definitely think its worth it. The subs are pretty big, I think they're 14in. So if you're looking for a quick lunch, this'd be on my list.

(I usually get the club)"}
