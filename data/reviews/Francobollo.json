{"text":"Quaint restaurant. Same owners of Terra and Sarpa. Food was excellent, service very good. We went on a Saturday night, restaurant was full but very noisy; difficult to converse.  We had gnocchi with crab and lobster, fritto misto, lamb and veal strip loin and shared a couple of salads.  All were delicious. Prices on the higher end."}
{"text":"Four of us had a 7pm dinner reservation at FrancoBollo last night. 7 pm was a bit early for my liking, but we were glad to have a reservation on a Saturday at this popular spot. Food is always quite good. Problem was, without telling us, the restaurant had booked our table for a second seating at 8:45pm. That gave us less than two hours to - sit and get comfortable. Order water and drinks. Enjoy the drinks. Peruse the menu and order dinner. Rush rush rush. Waiter was at our side pushing us along all night. There is a fine line between attentive and pushy. This waiter crossed that line. Appetizers were good. But the dishes were wisked off the table and the next course appeared just a bit too soon. Dinner was cleared and we were offered dessert and coffee and can we get your coats and here's your bill. This should have been a leisurely and relaxing meal. It was nothing of the sort. and of course, we paid full freight!! Not nice, FrancoBollo. You will loose good customers if you treat them in this manner. For the price, go somewhere else where you can kick back and relax and enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my meal here!  Good Ceasar salad and penne arriabata. Service is always great and a nice uptown restaurant to go.   Food - 4/5 Ambiance - 5/5 Service - 5/5 Price to Value - 4/5"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed a meal with friends at Francobollo tonight.  From when we arrived until the click of the latch as we left everything was great!  The staff was friendly and professional simultaneously.  Plenty of menu choices, some classic Italian dishes and some modern dishes with an Italian preparation.  I took arancini as a starter and they were very good.  The exterior was lovely dark gold and crunchy on the outside and gooey goodness inside.  The monkfish main was cooked well, thankfully because it's inedible if left a minute too long.  The broccolini accompaniment was a little too soft for me but was flavourful.  Pistachio panna cotta was creamy and tasted very nice, perhaps a tiny bit too sweet for me but, it is dessert so I should likely expect that.  Stylish decor, very good food, and great staff - I'll be back."}
{"text":"Had a group meeting/presentation dinner in their upstairs private function room tonight and was thoroughly impressed from start to finish.  It's my first time here so I didn't have any expectations.  Waiters were friendly and efficient, for starters I had the Custom Grown Greens with pumpkin seeds and cranberries which was very fresh.  For mains I had the Seabass which had a very generous portion and was seasoned and cooked perfectly (crispy skin and all).  My wife had Veal scaloppini which she really enjoyed and not too heavy.  Dessert was tiramisu with fresh fruit selection, again done perfectly.  Even our decaf drip coffee was rich and flavourful.  Food came out piping hot and drinks were always topped up.  Highly recommend and we will definitely be back to try their pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant located on Avenue Road. Beautiful and modern interior and very pleasant staff. Menu has some unique items that you won't usually find at other places. Tastes delicious and looks beautiful. I suggest to make a reservation as its small and gets packed pretty quick. Highly recommend to visit this place, especially good for a special occasion."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!! Beautiful decor, fantastic food in a great location on Avenue Rd. No one knows food like the Italians!!! Balisimo!!"}
{"text":"The interior is lovely, but that did not compensate for expensive, mediocre food. By chance I overheard someone from my fitness class discussing the restaurant who had recently eaten dinner there and who had the same experience and came to the same conclusion, not worth going back."}
{"text":"Sensational food, stunning decor, fantastic service, very appropriately priced, and just an awesome atmosphere inside. Really can't say enough about the decor, the place is very new, and very white in its overall aesthetic, and it makes for a really bright, romantic setting for dinner. Went here on Valentine's Day, food was top notch, and the service was great despite how busy it was.  Fairly new restaurant, about a year old so not a ton of reviews, but an excellent, excellent restaurant. Really can't say enough about the food, and despite being a little away from the downtown core, definitely rivals some of the best downtown Toronto Italian restaurants that are making it big in reviews right now. The only criticism was the lemon chicken was a little strong on the lemon, but probably because I left my lemon wedge basting on my meat without taking it off. Great homemade focaccia, delicious octopus appetizer, good portion sizes, and honestly heavenly tiramisu. That tiramisu should be its own self-standing take out item.  Awesome. The place for Italian food when you want to hop out of downtown Toronto for somewhere different.  And... Managed to deliver this kind of quality on February 14th, one of the busiest, highest pressure, highest volume food nights of the year. Love francobollo."}
{"text":"Welcome to your next uptown date night.  The sister restaurant to the fabulous Terra in Thornhill has two key things going for it...impressively designed decor and really good food.  Grilled sardines and beef carpaccio to start the meal were both on point. For mains, we chose snow crab risotto from the list of specials, and vitello al limone (lemon veal scaloppine) from the regular menu. Everything was delicious!   Now...having said that, I need to mention (simply because they have shared ownership) that Terra is still a better restaurant. It's 5 stars while Franco is hovering somewhere just above a 4. For one thing, we dined at Franco with two other couples and were involved in animated conversation for most of the night, which caused the server to become clearly impatient when trying to communicate with us. Not sure if she was being rude, or us, or both. Either way, it's her job to remain pleasant and our job to enjoy ourselves, capiche? :) Also, some of the food at Terra blew our hair back with its amazing-ness. Franco was great but not yet at that level.  Still--recommended!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful dinner last night with Tony as our server. He went out of his way to make our first dining experience a memorable one. Service is attentive, but not overbearing and the food was excuisite. The calamari appetizer was the best we've had, the clam linguini was as good as it gets and the white fish special did not disappoint. The restaurant's atmosphere is modern, yet intimate and very comfortable. Wine list options are a little pricey, but good. Francobollo is one of the best Italian restaurants in Toronto and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and great food, loved their calamari fritti! Parking is a bit tricky but street parking is free after 6pm."}
{"text":"We were here on a Sunday at 6pm and it was really quiet and empty.  It had a total approximately 10 tables in a small area.  The tables and chairs felt too small for the setting and hard to get through.  This Resturant is a chain with Terra at yonge and 407.  The service is very sincere and friendly.  Overall impression of the food is good but nothing great!  Probably a bit overpriced"}
{"text":"This is a brand new and excellent Italian restaurant. It is owned by the owners of Terra (another fine establishment) and Rustys (that bar in blue mountain). We had the pasta and it was freshly cooked.. One of the best tiramisu in the city. All desserts are made in house (not imported) and the focaccia bread to start off was freshly baked!   Cauliflower soup was light and not creamy and the ambiance is a little loud but still a good new restaurant to check out birth of Bloor..."}
{"text":"Extremely good service and food literally out of this world. The place itself is very beautiful, pleasurable, the atmosphere is relaxing and enjoyable. Reminds me of my time dining in New York. Definitely a restaurant worth visiting often. Service and food top notch!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Understated ambiance food menu and service. Over delivered. Everything was fantastic. Had a great evening."}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh fresh.  Nondescript gem with great menu of seasonal ingredients and great wine list.  Attentive service with wait staff that are intimately familiar with all dishes on menu, happy to elaborate on why they recommend something.  Pasta is made in house, cooked to perfection - would come back to Toronto just to have some Francobollo macaroni.    Four stars because decor is outdated and feels cold."}
