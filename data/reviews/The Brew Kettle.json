{"text":"Food and beer menu selections are both wonderful. Beer selections rotate and have been excellent on both occasions I've visited. Casual American and /or bar food, but done really well. Apparently they have salads, but you really want the Triple Pig Sammich. The burgers are very good as well. Our server recommended and I'm glad I went for it. Service was great on an average weekday lunch time, pleasant and attentive. Will definitely dine again!"}
{"text":"Beer selection is amazing. Dry rub wings are simply the best wings I have ever had. Triple pig sandwich is one of the best sandwiches in Cleveland. This place is great."}
{"text":"Good food overall. Huge portions. Service a little slow and server didn't check back as often as we liked. Sat waiting for our bill for 15 minutes. Could have been much faster for a slow Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"This place has awesome burgs, fries and beer on tap.  Service is always great and friendly.  I brew on site every couple months and there are many good choices.  I have made several but Dead Poets IPA is my favorite.  Kevin the brew master and his staff make the brewing process easy, fun and a great experience.  There are specials every day of the week so take advantage of them.  My favorite is the wings!"}
{"text":"Reliably good food! I have been here with large groups and with individual tables."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for a while and I love it. I always get the 6 way chili and it's always delicious. Only problem is the tables were super sticky."}
{"text":"Was very impressed with this place. I would recommend getting the dry rub wings! They were phenomenal! Food came fast and was good. Service was friendly. Defiantly would come again."}
{"text":"Food was very good, tasty and nicely served. Service attentive. My husband loved the variety of beers. I'll come back for sure but next time will ask NOT to sit under the cob-webbed, dust-mite infested boar's head!"}
{"text":"It would be too easy just to say 5 stars for the beer alone. The food is not to be missed. The wings and pulled pork are both amazing! Cheers...."}
{"text":"I'm giving one star totally based on how they have let the quality of the food fall.  

I've been there in the past to brew, drink and eat with great results.  But within the past month I have gone there, as has a friend, and we've come to the same conclusion that the food is just terrible.  The BBQ is terrible - burned ribs, cold pulled pork and tasteless sauce.  

Beer is still great, service was fine and I'm sure the brewing experience is good ( haven't heard otherwise).   They have to look at what happened to the food because at one time it was good.

Stop in for a beer  but go elsewhere to eat."}
{"text":"Don't be swayed by the outside appearance of a liquor store/ brewery/BBQ sketchy strip mall look. This is the classic don't judge a brewery by its cover. It is very roomy inside with cool different areas and views of the brewery inside. 

We were greeted and sat right away during the end of a Saturday night rush. The prices were excellent and on point. $4 for a pint of their beer and it was excellent. White Raja..yes. Black Raja even better and their Milk Stout was literally my dessert. Jen was one of the friendliest most helpful server I have ever had. Knew her beer product, referenced reviews and gave recommendations when asked. 

$7.50 for a large pork sandwich. $10 for the big pig which is what I had. The beers were awesome but here is the reason for the 3 stars....food quality. Large portions don't always equal quality. The big pig wasn't much larger than the regular pork sandwiches and my meat was good but had a reheated temperature feel. The Mac and cheese lacked well...cheese and other pulled pork sandwiches were soggy at the bottom. The sauce was in a small cup and lacked any flavor. The large macaroni and cheese plate is a big pass.

I'd go back for the beers only and skip the food or stick with something simple like pretzels or nachos. A hidden gem of a brewery that is about to explode now that the craft beer world has discovered them. The food....not so much."}
{"text":"The servers are all super friendly, and very knowledgeable. Of you're in the mood for BBQ at its finest, then look no further. The wings, the pulled pork, the brisket, and the perch are ALL phenomenal. And it's really cool that you can brew your own beer too. Good for families and everyone in between."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 4-5 times and love the variety.  There are always good beers on tap from the ones they brew to other lesser known beers.  The food is quite wonderful too.  My fav is the Andouille Mac n Cheese :)  In addition to the regular american sports I have also seen soccer on the tvs there.  Not centered around it's bar, so it seems like it would be fine to take the family.

I do not get to The Brew Kettle often enough"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and the food and service is always solid (my wife raves about their fish sandwich).  I now seem to have an easier time than in the past at finding a tasty beer to drink.  Nice to see that despite all the success this place is had that they're still finding ways to improve."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a job in Strongsville to do so we figured we'd give this place a try.... Boy o boy were we ever glad we did!!!! The BBQ is phenomenal.... I had the triple pig and the meat was tender and sooooooo flavorful...The portions are enormous!!!! My sandwich was so HUGE that I will be having the rest for lunch tomorrow:) The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the service was terrible :("}
{"text":"Good menu, extensive craft beer selections. A much better choice than one of the chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my experience here. They have, by far, the best beer sampler system I've seen. They line up your samples in order on your little yellow sheet (which you use to choose what you want to try) that way there's no question of what's what/trying to keep track of 6-10 different beer samples. YAY! Why don't more places adopt this strategy? (I'm sure paper expense has a little bit to do with it, but the convenience is great.) Anyway, the 6-way chili was a star - very flavorful and hearty. The triple pig sandwich should always be shared (luckily we asked) and it was really good too. Beer highlights: Old 21 and Ruddy Rye with the definite winner being the Black Rajah. YUM!!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, otherwise quite poor. The food was unimpressive.  When we got there, we we're told it was an hour. We were told the place was great, so we decided to grab a drink at the bar and wait. There was an empty table in the bar area. We asked if it we self seating and it wasn't, but they allowed us to sit there. Why didn't they offer the table in the first place?"}
{"text":"There mostly to kill time. Good beer selection. Good food - I had the pretzel (note: that honey mustard is hot in a new way...I could feel it deep in my nose somehow) and the meatloaf sandwich. I only had one or two of their beers, and they were decent. I'd go back, probably."}
{"text":"The best part is.... No budweiser products, at all and if you sit next to somebody that asks for one they will laugh at them. Always awesome beers on tap and the food is always great. Usually busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"I went to The Brew Kettle for lunch on  a Saturday at around 2 with the family. We spent over an hour there,  but it was not my choice; the service was awful.
When we got seated it took 10 minutes for the waitress to come and greet us. This gave us plenty of time to look at the menu so we ordered drinks and food at the same time. 8 minutes later the drinks came. 15 minutes after that the food came. Over 30 minutes after that the check came. These were the only times the waitress came to check on us.
The food was decent-just food you'd get at any bar and grill. It wasn't anything special.
Alot of people seem to like it on here. So maybe it was just a bad day for them. I probably won't be heading back anytime soon.

tl;dr My experience: Nice atmosphere, decent food, horrendous service."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!
We were traveling to Cleveland to catch the Cubs in town and found this place for dinner. Service was friendly, helpful with the beer menu,  and very attentive. My wife had the Chicken Parm sandwich, I had the Fish tacos, and our kid had Chicken fingers. The Smoked wings were really good too. Their sides were great and huge portions. Try having their Big Woody beer. It is so good I picked up four 22oz bottles to go. 
Great job Brew Kettle, I wish you were in Chicago! If you are in the Cleveland area don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place based on all of the good reviews. I was sadly disappointed.  My husband, friend, and I stopped here on a Friday night and they were fairly busy but there was no wait. I had a chicken parm sandwich, while my husband and his friend each got items involving pulled pork. Both stated the pork was dry, and they had to request more sauce. The piece of chicken on my sandwich was HUGE. It was at least twice the size of the bun, which made it difficult to eat. It also lacked on the typical marinara mixture that goes on chicken parm, so it was also dry. I got green bean fries as a side and asked if I could get a side of ranch. I was told they don't have ranch. Really? It came with a special sauce that was too tangy for me. My husband said his sweet potatoe fries weren't that great either. The positives for the visit were the food came out very quickly, and the beer was good. Unfortunately that won't be enough for us to drive the 15 minutes to return."}
{"text":"May have been hire rating but hostess was rude and the worst I have ever met!!
The cod fish was good but very tiny portion. I suppose the large number. Of fries was supposed to be the meal. I should have ordered fries with a side of fish!"}
{"text":"Have come here numerous times for lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed.  Love the food....jalapeno bread, gumbo, prime rib w\herbed compound butter, backyard sampler .....everything I have ordered has been worth the money and delicious!  And I don`t even need to mention the beer slection....it is 5 stars and I love the sampler so I can try all the beers at once!"}
{"text":"I stopped here with my family on our way through Strongsville, because we had heard that the food was pretty good. The atmosphere is sports bar. It is not a big place, but was not busy so there were plenty of tables open. There were 3 adults and 1 toddler in my group. The waitress seemed to know the menu pretty well and recommended the cajun red bean humus and jalapeno cornbread. The humus was just okay, and a small portion, so if you have a large group it is not a great choice. The cornbread was delicious. It is sweet and had heat from the peppers. One person in our group ordered the grilled burrito. She felt that it needed some kind of sauce inside because, while it was loaded with meat, the meat was pretty dry. She ended up sending it back. Another person had the triple pig sandwich. It was a large sandwich, and had plenty of meat, but my friend felt that it would definitely be better with cheese or something to give it a little moisture and enhance the overall flavor, but he was satisfied with it. He did not care for the vinegar based BBQ sauce. I tried it and felt that it had a bit of a vinegar ketchup flavor, and did not care for it either. The toddler with us had the mini corn dogs and they were over cooked. I personally had the cajun chicken pasta. The flavor was good, and it was creamy enough, but lacked much chicken. It had a few diced tomatoes, which really enhanced the flavor, but it could have used a bit more. I also had the bread pudding for dessert, and that was delicious! The custard flavored sauce with cinnamon and maybe nutmeg flavors was so good. I really enjoyed it. The beer that we tried was a cherry tree cider and it was pretty good. I would go back and give it another try, but I would ask more questions when ordering. The waitress did not come back to refill drinks or bring us our check often enough or soon enough. In fact we ended up walking up to another employee and asking if we could get our check. The waitress seemed to stay in the back a lot so there were few opportunities to ask her for our bill. She was very nice though."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Best pulled pork sandwich.  Only downside, my husband doesn't like dill and the cook does, in slaw and tarter sauce. No substitutes for either. Service is great. Very popular and for good reason."}
{"text":"Great food, probably the best of the 3 local breweries for me.  Solid beer list (30 rotating taps), including several of their own at any given time.  The White Rajah is my favorite.  Sandwiches are good sized, and come with options for sides.  My favorites are the sweet potato fries and the fried green beans.  The cole slaw is also great, but it's got dill in it, so that may not be your thing.  Solid prices, make this one of my favorite restaurants in the area. 

They also do a Brew-on-premises thing, where you can reserve a time and brew beer there.  I haven't done it yet, but it seems really cool, and the prices (~$150 for a full keg of beer) are pretty good.  They also sell grains and hops for homebrewers, which is helpful."}
{"text":"I have sung the praises of the Brew Kettle previously, but must add to that by mentioning the chicken wings. The evolution and progress of this snack in the American culinary consciousness is remarkable. Relegated to the same ranking as the neckbone some decades ago, the recipe reputedly founded at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York has taken on such gargantuan proportions that it is almost inconceivable that poultry farmers aren't concocting a way to mutate the birds for more wings. Hmmm... In any event, in my experience, the wings prepared at the Kettle are exceptional. Not deep fried in the traditional manner, it's the smoked taste and char grilling that set them apart. Also appreciate that they are served as the full joint. The only draw back is the lack of rub or sauce choices. Only 3 are available. But the taste is so good that I would consume them au naturel. Paired with the Kettle's \"Big Woody\" crafted beer and I would pitch a tent there forever."}
{"text":"We have eaten at the Brew Kettle several times now and it never disappoints. The beers are great and the food is delicious. The service has always been top notch, and it is definitely our favorite spot to go in the area. We have had their nachos, wings and quesadillas on previous visits which were yum and quickly devoured. Today we tried the jalapeno corn bread, chicken wings, chili, and burrito. The burrito was quite big stuffed with what must have been a lb or more of pork. I attempted to eat it all but didnt quite make it. It was very tastey. The jalepeno cornbread came with a cinnamon butter that when combined was outstanding. My husband loves their wings and ordered those yet again as they never disappoint. He was even trying to get them to give him their secret rub recipe. The chili was tastey and perfect for a cold snowy day. We each got one of the brew kettles home brewed beers to quinch our thirsts. I got the Valentines special the Vanilla Frambozzen, which was a little sweet and perfect for me as I am not a beer drinker, especially the hoppier ones. My husband got the Awesome IPL which he said was an easy drinking beer and he really enjoyed it. We will definitely be back over and over again!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised when I walked in. However the sticky booth and table quickly changed my mind. The service was slow , flys flying everywhere. I ordered a dinner salad and chicken Parmesan sandwich it all came out together. Waitress never came back to refill drinks and we were given the wrong check.. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hate the atmosphere...LOVE the food!
We have never been disappointed here.  Always good.  I don't care for the atmosphere...the music is always too loud and it lacks any intimacy, but the food is always awesome.  Not bar food by any means!  The BBQ spaghetti, corn bread appetizer and burrito are to die for. Family friendly - casual."}
{"text":"Less than a half hour's drive from the Beer Engine is the Brew Kettle Taproom & Smokehouse, located in a suburb outside Cleveland. Beer nuts flock here for brewer Chris McKim's singular concoctions, which he sells under the Ringneck Brewing label. Sample the sobriety-crushing Old 21 IPA, clocking in at 9% alcohol, or dial it back with a quality session beer like Victory's Prima Pils. All in all, some two dozen varieties are on tap for tasting. For those who'd rather brew their own, the attached brew-on-premises provides all the equipment, ingredients and know-how to craft an award-winner of one's own."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The pulled pork is amazing! Great wait staff, very quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This unassuming strip mall restaurant is an excellent, fun place to eat and drink. The Brew Kettle is not only home to a micro brewery and a restaurant with remarkable food, there is a place to craft your own beer. Aside from that, the restaurant is a bar style place with 4 TV's and an extensive list of beers. The food is amazing. I had a smoky for an appetizer, which is similar to beef jerky, but tastes a lot better. For dinner, I enjoyed barbecued spaghetti, with pulled pork, BBQ sauce, and cheddar cheese. The dessert I enjoyed was a Reese's peanut butter torte, which was the chocolate dessert of the night. There is also a patio, but it's in the middle of a rear parking lot. Go to the Brew Kettle, no matter where you are in Greater Cleveland. The gas money will be well spent."}
{"text":"Make there own beer which I like but the place had a sort of stale \"hamster chip\" kinda' smell. The food was pretty tasty, I would go back again."}
{"text":"Nice place. Great barbecue, loved the pulled pork, and wonderful Cole slaw. Awesome beer selection. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"The Brew Kettle met my expectations and exceeded them as well. We got to brew our own beer with the help of very knowledgeable and nice employees. While our beer brewed we had a tasty bite to eat. I got the bbq pulled sandwich piled high with cheese and tender bbqed pork and a side of their scrumptious sweet potato fries. Our server was a sweetheart, and so kind as well, bringing our food over to where we were brewing, gave us extra napkins, utensils anything we needed she helped us with! We are so glad we made the drive out there because we enjoyed our time at Brew Kettle immensely, beer was delicious, and their food was just as good! We will be back."}
{"text":"Great burgers and excellent coleslaw!  This is my go to spot for a lunch on a Friday afternoon. A great way to end the week."}
{"text":"Bartendets basically ignored us. Lots of knats and flies. One lnded in my 11.50 beer."}
{"text":"Dissapointed. Server was great! Ordered the buffalo dip appetizer, too dry for me. All the reviews said to try the BBQ spaghetti, I actually hated it! My Italian boyfriend won't even touch the leftovers."}
{"text":"Very solid food.  Even the kids were happy, and that's not the norm.  But the star of the show was the incredible tap list.  Their own brew represented quite well, and just an amazing list of guest taps.  Next to Ashley's, maybe the best I've seen."}
{"text":"Beer selection is one of the best around. One thing I like is that they don't serve any of the big name breweries like Bud or Coors. There stance is that there are plenty of places that serve the big boys beer that they can really focus on their own brands as well as a nice selection of crafts from all over. I am a fan of the White Rajah and Old 21. Food is also pretty good. I usually order the smoked wings and a pretzel. The pretzel mustard will clear your sinuses as it has a huge Wasabi kick. I really go for the beer and smoked wings. Service is typically pretty decent. They have a wide variety of menu items. There isn't anything super fancy on the menu. I go for the beer. Did I mention I go for the beer?"}
{"text":"Their beers are very good especially the White Rajah.  I had their gumbo, jalapeno cornbread and smoked wings.  All of which were very tasty and everything coming out of the kitchen also looked very good.  They get some very rare beers from other breweries here most of which are high percenters.  I drove over an hour just to visit the Brew Kettle. I came midafternoon and the place was for the most part empty, but the place became very busy at dinner."}
{"text":"THE GOOD: Macaroni and cheese is awesome! As is the chocolate covered cherry martini (I'm not so much of a beer person, but if you are.. the beer selection is pretty big and varied). The atmosphere is really cool, they have a ton of different beer logos on the wall.

THE BAD: Service. We  had an unnecessarily long wait for our table. We walked around looking at the beer/wine making stations, and also stood around staring at the different decor on the walls (they don't have anywhere for waiting guests to sit anywhere.. so you just stand there)  we also noticed open tables that just needed to be cleaned. Half an hour goes by. ANNOYING. Our server was super slow, and super awkward. I had to wait 10 minutes just for more water, and could see him sitting and BS'ing with a table of what looked like off-the-clock coworkers. Also, the portions are pretty small. I ordered a salad with pulled pork and coleslaw on it. While it was pretty good.. I'm glad I also ordered the mac n' cheese.

This definitely would not be my first choice at a night out again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for quite a while and was glad I did.  We went on a Wednesday night around 730 pm.  There was a 20 to 30 minute wait and that was accurate.  After being seated our server was friendly, I asked for some suggestions which she gave, and we went with a few of them. . We ordered the smokehouse wings with the dry rub.  When they came they were cold, and I told my server. She didnt offer to bring us anymore and did not remove it from our check.  She said they are kept in the cooler and then heated up briefly for an order. One in our party ordered the fish and chips and that was very good, and the other had the Meatleaf, which was ok.  It was hard and dense and ok at best.  I ordered the beef brisket sandwich which was not like other brisket that I've had. It was shredded and chewy and there was a small amount of beef on the large bun. The sweet potato fries and the coleslaw were the best things we ate.   Overall, I wouldn't return for the food. But the atmosphere was ok."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, food and beer selection. Staff are all knowledgeable about their own beers as well as other crafts that are on tap. All food is homemade with generous portion size. Their wings are grilled and are amongst my favorites along with the Buffalo Chicken Salad and Meatloaf."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent beer, excellent prices, cool servers, great vibe, unstoppable deliciousness"}
{"text":"Food and beer selection were very good. Service was unfriendly at times, albeit on a busy night, and fruit flues frequented our beers."}
{"text":"I'd give them10 stars if possible.  Everything is great. Service is wonderful."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, I've had my share of black bean burgers.... Fortunately, I was extremely content with my veggie burger (which was huge!) and raspberry vanilla beer. The service was on point, especially considering we went during peak dinner hours on a Saturday night. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"do not buy gift certificates for Brew Kettle

was given a $225  gift certificate to brew some of their beer.  brewed one batch and still had a $70 balance remaining, which i lost the paper for, but still had the original certificate and receipt for how much i used on first batch, which is showed i had the $70 balance.  they gave me the complete run around and told me they had no records of my brewing transactions with them, and that i probably gave the receipt to someone else.

the wait to brew is awfully long as well, and the food is lacking as well
many of my brewing buddies gave this place (under original owners) good reviews, but not so under new ownership"}
{"text":"Been going here for at least 8 years; a favorite place for my friends and I to hang out.  The brews are good (tons of variety) and I like the Smokin Burrito (pulled pork in a burrito - but I think they call it something else now).  Owner Chris always says hi when we are in and we like the atmosphere.  It's something different."}
{"text":"My hubby LOVES the food here; especially the kettle chips. I got food poisoning 1 time so I now stick with the Buffalo Chicken Salad. The wings are fantastic! The bar is a great size with ample room. The noise is at a reasonable level. You can actually talk to, & hear, the person right next to you. The staff is respectful & friendly. I'd give The Brew Garden 5 stars if I never got the food poisoning. It's definitely a place to try as long as you are all for a very sicial setting."}
{"text":"Mine and my husband's favorite place to eat. Been there several times and will come back several more. The food is outstanding and plentiful.  You get so much food for your money. The service is friendly and attentive.  The beer selection is the best.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Good food, outstanding beer selection, and you gotta love the beer flight option.  Anywhere I can get Three Floyds Alpha King and The Brew Kettle's White Raja in the same sitting is a place I'll return."}
{"text":"I work through lunch and called to order the special of the day to go, smoked wings.  I was told that they charge regular menu price for take out.  I do not think this is very reasonable and I'm not sure what they think they will gain by my presence in their restaurant, drinking my water with lemon.  They have lost a good, regular customer."}
{"text":"I've been going to The Brew Kettle for many years.  The food is excellent, the beer is better.  I've reviewed many of their beers on Untappd.  If you're coming for beer try starting with the Black Rajah.  It's an excellent black IPA. They also bring in a wide variety of guest taps to complement their own.  Around 20 taps going at any given time.

The food is also awesome.  The smoked wings can't be beat.  The meatloaf, burger, pulled pork and fish tacos are all great.  Everything is very good and a cozy  atmosphere too.  Not too big or small.

Finally, if you want to brew your own beer they have a small batch brewing facility.  Use their kettles, their ingredients, their bottles.  You just show up, brew whatever you want from a list of beers, they store while it ferments and you come back in a few weeks to bottle it.  Easy and fun.  No mess at home and they provide guidance during the process.  Follow their recipe and you can't go wrong.  Great boys night, girls night or whatever.  Call for an appointment.  They're booked well in advance."}
{"text":"Good food, fair prices, and consistently rotating beer selections. This is a good place to go that is local and offers a variety of beers to try which switches out every week and are seasonal. I really enjoy how they give descriptions and provide the IBU for each brew. I highly recommend for a casual dinner with good drinks."}
{"text":"A lot of my middle aged co-workers love the Brew Kettle... but I never really enjoyed it that much.  The food is pretty standard for a bar and grill.  The beer list is better than average.

For a bar they close really early also.  11pm on a Saturday?!?  Common.

There is one specific thing that bothers me about The Brew Kettle... everything is in a grid.  Yes that is what I said.  Everything is laid out in a grid which makes the bar feel awkward.  The beer list is a grid with the company, APV, bitterness, price, etc.  The decor in the wall is laid out in perfect lines... taking away from dive bar atmosphere I think they are going for.  But who knows... I might be the weird one and no one else notices."}
{"text":"Great spot for food and beer! The service was great and I enjoyed every beer I tried. I will definitely be visiting in the future!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Great salad   The flatbread was a little to crisp. Fish & chips nice & fluffy."}
{"text":"I've been a long time fan of TBK, before they opened the restaurant side of the business. For those of you who believe that beer brings family and friends closer together, this place is for you. You can brew beer with your friends and bottle your recipe choice for that special occasion. If you have not tried this method of brewing, you must, it will only bring you and your friends closer together. As for some of the comments regarding the restaurant side of the business, the menu is a meat lovers paradise. The service could be quicker, however, the end result is a great meal, but not for those who are looking for a weight watchers diet special. Great hops and meat is always a win, win proposition."}
{"text":"Took a bunch of friends here after a hockey tournament yesterday.  I was talking up the wings to everyone and was excited to show off a jewel of a restaurant to some who had not been there before.  Boy was I embarrassed.  The service was okay but it took forever.  It took almost twenty minutes for our first round of beers to arrive.  There were twelve of us, eight adults and four kids.  There was really no crowd yet at 4:30 on a Monday night.  We fit nicely in two large booths near the entrance (off to the right as you walk in).  The food was good don't get me wrong but it seemed like they were running out of wings or something and the orders seemed skimpy.  When I pointed it out they just looked at me in denial and said that's how they always are.  I pointed out to them that I have been here a half dozen times and these wings don't even look close to what I usually have.  They did not care.  Eventually they brought me two more wings.  Unfortunately four others in our party also order wings and they did not acknowledge the deficient product for them.  The manager pointed out to me that they always serve only five wings and I pointed out to her the menu clearly states a pound and a half of wings (not five).  These wings barely covered the small round plate they were served on.  I'd be surprised if they were not even 10 oz. all together--pre cooked! No way it was a pound and a half!  So stuff happens but at least acknowledge it and own it when an obvious loyal customer calls you out.  Shame on you Brew Kettle.  A very disappointed customer."}
{"text":"There's too much too say about this place. I'm not mature enough to drink but everyone says their beers are excellent. Their food is also very good. Burgers are big and juicy, with plenty of different kinds and toppings. Fries could be better. Chicken wings and ribs are also very good. Coleslaw is also very good. But my favorite thing to order, and really it's a love/hate ordeal with if its good to you or not, is the Mac and cheese. White cheddar cheese with macaroni. Never disappoints, always look forward to it. 

Highly recommend if you are around the area! One of the best places in Cleveland in my opinion."}
{"text":"It's more like a budget brew pub, nothing special, but whatever, ok. Good beer options, but food is just ok--unexciting menu, limp fries, everything seems to come with coleslaw, that kind of thing. Multiple TVs but they're all actually pretty small, smaller than a lot of other places, so not really something you'd want to rely on to watch a game. I don't understand the good ratings others have given this place, have they been outside of Strongsville for food & drinks before? I wouldn't really recommend or choose to come back, but those who are less discerning would probably be ok with this place. I'd rather spend a couple dollars more and go to a gastropub instead."}
{"text":"I finally remembered to search for here.
The Brew Kettle was elected the 'Best Brewpub in the U.S.A.' by denizens of RateBeer .com .
I generally visit Cleveland, OH. twice a year now (since it no longer has an indoor soccer franchise) for an exposition called 'Cinema Wasteland'. The link describing it is on my regular bookmark page.
I have tried to save money when attending Cinema Wasteland by staying in the less-expensive motel next door to the Holiday Inn Strongsville, but it is no longer a Motel 6, and has gotten sufficiently pricey that it's a better value to stay at the Holiday Inn (especially for late-night guest room parties - you can ask me about that in person); and by not renting an automobile.
But when doing the latter, it meant I did not get to the Brew Kettle.
[I have tried to communicate to management that, during the weekends of Cinema Wasteland, there are _hundreds_ of attendees from across the U.S.A. who are otherwise left to the 'ehhh...' hotel bar and | or whatever beer they have bought from the nearby convenience stores, who would most likely _love_ the beers served there. So why not send the brewpub van to and from the Holiday Inn on a two-hour interval on Friday and Saturday nights?]
So I have resumed renting an auto from Cleveland Airport. (Do I get socked with visitor taxes and fees. But I use it to go the Big Lots to get a bucket, cheese puffs | tortilla chips | mini-pretzels {to snack while viewing movies at Cinema Wasteland}, and then to Heinen's for a 12-pack of some _quality beers_ {which go into the bucket with some free ice}.) Because this is a great brewpub.
The location is entirely deceiving. It is in a strip mall on the east side of Pearl Road [the default Google map has it on the wrong side] next door to an Entenmann's bakery outlet store.
If you're watching your money (because you want to buy obscure DVDs in the dealers' room at Cinema Wasteland), you have a lot of selections here. There is always at least one Ringneck Brwg. (the 'host' brewery) beer on special; and _Straub_ Beer [from Saint Mary's, PA. - which still closes for a week the first week of deer hunting season in PA.] is the megabrew lager.
The chalkboard behind the bar informs you what is on tap, its strength, IBUs; and price. You will find drafts from craft breweries in New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Oregon, and California.
If you are a member of the American Homebrewers Association, you get a discount on food items here.
The venue is festooned with breweriana from predecessor Ohio breweries.
I could compose a lot of text here describing just the Ringneck beers, but I won't. They do rotate. So what I had may not be on when you visit. I'll conclude by scribing that this *is* a beer destination. If you are in Cleveland; yes, Great Lakes is superb, and you can get there on the Cleveland Rapid (subway). But you should get to the Brew Kettle."}
{"text":"Great - Chicken legs and wings. Home brewed beers were amazing. I went with a pale ale of some sort. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and had a great sense of humor.

Good - The ribs were tasty but did not fall off the bone. Somewhat tough, but good flavor.

Average - The pulled pork. I have had much better. Either needs more sauce or more vinegar. Seemed a little dry.

Bad - The sun through the window blinded my vision while eating. There are four curtains covering all the other windows except this one. It had tinted glass strips but that did not do much. It was very distracting and annoying."}
{"text":"You won't find a better selection of beers, period. Great smoked wings, get the dry rubbed.. I try to order something different when we stop in and everything else has been very tasty, but I keep going back to those wings. You get the whole wings!! If you want to brew your own beer call for an appt., but be prepared to have 2-3 month wait. They are that busy!  Friendly knowledgeable staff. Go early to get a table. And make sure you try at least one of their in-house brews, very inexpensive and phenomenal! Old 21 double IPA"}
{"text":"Usually great.  Ordered fish sandwich.  Very thin piece of fish surrounded by breeding.  Doubt it was cod.  They recently raised prices but food quality has declined."}
{"text":"I love this place ... great bar food, great selection of beers on tap that is ever changing, and good service. I've tried the wings, fish & chips, and the burgers, and all were prepared well and fairly priced. By the way, the wings are huge ... not the tiny ones you get at BW3. 

And the beer ... Oh the beer! Despite that they carry so many great beers on tap, try theirs first! All of their home brews are great, especially the White Rajah IPA, which is nationally ranked.

The only issue I have is that the word on The Brew Kettle is out ... so this place is always crowded. Always. But stop in ... it's definitely worth the wait for a table or a spot at the bar."}
{"text":"If I wrote this review a year ago or so, I probably would have rated it higher.  But it seems to me that once they expanded the food quality has diminished.  
I had the perch and it was over cooked.  It wasn't fresh.

The beer selection is still very good."}
{"text":"Yummy!! This place was really good. I just got their basic brew kettle burger, but wasn't disappointed! Also the black bottom peanut butter pie was delicious! I'd give them five stars, but my husband had to send back his burger two times to get it cooked properly. Mine however was perfect...So I'm not really sure what happened..."}
{"text":"Awesome service, even better food. Try the sausage and beer gumbo and mac and cheese. The beer selection is out of this world, unfortunately I was on lunch. I was here on a work trip, we will definitely stop here again the next time we come through the area!"}
{"text":"I liked this place, but it didn't knock my socks off. I went there with some friends after a day of hanging out. I got a beer sampler for my drink, which was good - they had a wide variety of beers and drinks to choose from. I ordered the pulled pork flatbread because my friend who lives in Strongsville said that it was what they are known for. They brought out a BBQ chicken flatbread instead, so that was a bummer. Then it took awhile before our waitress came back, so I ended up eating the chicken flatbread. She did put in an order for a pulled pork one, so I ended up leaving with a free, second flatbread. Overall, it was good."}
{"text":"Great food - Slow Service 
Love the food and beers here ... everything on the menu is top notch, INTERESTING and delicious .. the horse radish/honey mustard for the hot prezzels is awesome. 

Only \"complaint\" is that you will be here a long time .. 1 hour lunch is normal. You wait to be asked what you want to drink ... 10 minutes later your beers will come from the bar and you will be told \"I'll give you time to look at menu.\" 10 minutes later your order is taken .. 20 minutes or more to make a lunch. Great food but don't come here if you are in a hurry. It's  place to go and sit and socialize and sit some more ..."}
{"text":"We brew beer here every year. food is good and the service is awesome. Lots of beers to choose from. Fun place"}
{"text":"Food is still amazing. Beer is too, from what I sipped (couldn't really partake of that due to preggo-ness). However, the bus boy dropped an entire glass of water on me within five minutes of us being seated. I cracked a joke, like, \"Hey, I can just tell everyone that my water broke!\" But inside I was thinking, \"You guys better f*cking comp my meal.\" They did, but only after we asked them to. Still, Brew Kettle gets 4 stars because of the great service ( and steady hands) the waitress provided us with. And the pulled pork nachos, which I will now proceed to fantasize about for months."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a late lunch here yesterday. The Beef Brisket was ver good. The Turkey Reuben was just okay. Instead of Sauerkraut, it had a slaw filling which was not as good. Will definitely plan on returning here in the near future."}
{"text":"The bartender (male) was awesome and very friendly. The smokehouse wings were full of flavor and fantastic! Not a huge fan of the macaroni chili (too sweet for my liking), but the perch tacos made up for it. Definitely worth returning to!"}
{"text":"We were here for one reason and that was White Rajah. We had called ahead and they said they were out, but I was hoping they brewed more six packs because I wanted to bring some home.

-Once we got there I was shocked by the size. It was in a small plaza and NOT what I expected but hey that's okay.  Once inside it was a little dumpy with lots of beer junk stapled on the walls and a long bar inside the bar area. Took some seats at the bar and had a very nice bartender. I ordered a sampler of a few of their beers.  Then I headed to the back to see if they had any six packs for sale..now before I finish my story let me say this..

They had one the COOLEST things I have ever seen at a brewery. People sign up and get to brew their own beer. They show up, choose a recipe, and make a beer. Then weeks later come back, bottle in and they even get to design their own bottle. I was told the price was somewhere around 150$ but you get something like 30 bottles of your own beer, I think it was very unique and apparently this is why/how Brew Kettle began.

...back to my story however, they had a few six packs in the cooler and the lady at the counter said I could purchase a case (only 2 six packs per customer..so 2 for me and 2 for my girlfriend so a case total).  So I go, enjoy my sampler, pay for a case and go back to the back of the place to get it. Well apparently they DIDN'T have a case in the back. I refused to buy cold six packs since I wouldn't be able to keep it cold, so I got a refund and moved on. (Luckily I found a crap ton of it at a grocery story right down the road where there was no limit so I bought two cases, unfortunately once home some didn't taste as fresh as others, ooo well).

-Now, as for the beer. The White Rajah was good as we hoped. VERY hoppy and fruity tasting, lots of flavor. The Pale was hoppy and tasty. The Imperial IPA was very good as well.

-In closing, I recommend this place for the White Rajah, however I didn't have the GREATEST experience at the brewery itself...from the miscommunication of the cases to the dingy feel of the place, so I would recommend to sign up for the beer making or stop in for a Rajah at the bar...otherwise just grab some at the local grocery store."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, daily specials are very good deals.  The BBQ spaghetti was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food,  good beer! Had the desert which was the best yet! Burgers were good as well."}
{"text":"They do a nice job here with their extensive food menu.

Had lunch there recently and dined on the Backyard Sampler...a heaping helping of shredded pulled pork, smoked wings and ribs, along with fries and slaw.  The portions were huge and the food quality is very good."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend since he loves White Rajah and we wanted to check out some of their other beers. The White Rajah was still definitely our favorite, but we also liked the Black Rajah. They have a very reasonable option for flights, and we were also pleasantly surprised by their food (awesome burgers and appetizers). The service was great, definitely no complaints. I can see how this place might be busy in the weekend/evenings, but on a weekday at 3 pm it was pretty chill and laid back, and definitely a great place for a conversation to catch up with friends. Brew Kettle is really conveniently located along I-71 and they have lots of room for parking too!"}
{"text":"2 stars go to the server. She was friendly and informative. I am not a beer drinker so maybe I missed the point of this restaurant. However.... If you serve food it should be tasty. The wings were over \"rubbed\" and the wrap was too bland. One more turn-off, the restaurant smelled of old beer and sour cleaning sponges."}
{"text":"Great beer selection! The food is very good - restaurant quality not bar food. Nice environment and service pretty good - excellent at the bar, table service only decent. But this place is great, go any dinner time and you'll wait for your seat for a reason!!"}
{"text":"DIY Beer ? BBQ Spaghetti ?!? FUN!!!

This is probably one the interesting places I've been too. Hidden in an unassuming strip mall is this brewery/restaurant. In the back is where the fun stuff happens. You can brew your own beer! There is a large room in the very back that has lots of barrels/containers of people's brews fermenting. They are all labeled with dates so they'll know which ones are done.

Once its done, you can bottle it up yourself. There is a machine you use to pump the beer in, pressurize, and snap on the bottle cap. You also have to put on a label (its by law). You can bring your own bottles and labels in, or you can buy it from them (more expensive option).

After helping some people I worked with bottle up their stock, we went to eat in the main restaurant. This is where I was introduced to the unsightly heaven called BBQ Spaghetti. oh My GOD. It was pasta, infused with bbq pork and bbq sauce. It was large and heavy, but oh so good. I barely ate 1/3 of the order. It only came with cole slaw as the side (no substitutions), but I swapped that for someone else's baked beans.

They also have a lot of brews on tap. Didn't really like the Oat Stout I ordered ..."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the bar that everyone is excited about? And I'm not a drinker..... but the food was mediocre.  Tried 3 times, and the same each time. Sorry."}
{"text":"One of the best experience's ever!!!!!!!! The food was amazing. the service from Karen was outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!! The best waitress EVER.  So informative about the beer, the food, everything. We truly did not want to leave. Their beer and wine making looks to be so much fun. We can not wait to come back and EAT AND DRINK AND MAKE BEER!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We miss the place as soon as we left. LOVED IT, LOVED IT AND LOVED KAREN MOST!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It's in a little shopping mall but well worth the time to check it out. I'm in town for business and I appreciate good beer and good food. After looking around I settled on this place because they offered perogies on their menu. My wife is half Polish and every Easter the family gets together we we make over 900 perogies so I know a thing or two about proper home made perogies. I have to admit, these were not bad (of couse not as good as ours but very close).  The sausage was delicious and the only complaint I can offer is the perogies are potato with cheese, not cheese perogies. 
As for the beer, I had a sampler of 5 and they were all very good. If you appreciate a good beer, come here, they are all very good. There were some hits and misses but the variety alone is worth the trip, especially if you like some strong brews like me. 
To sum things up, don't drive by this place because of the outside because what's inside is well worth the stop."}
{"text":"The food is great! The beer menu is amazing! Changes daily! Awesome atmosphere as well. Would recommend to the avid beer drinker and meat lover."}
{"text":"This place will always hold a special place in my heart. So many memories here, and the horseradish mustard with the pretzel appetizer is a roller coaster of a ride."}
{"text":"I got the chance to brew my own beer for the first time last week.  Holy crap, what a great experience!!!  The Brew Kettle has a lot going on.  In addition to the fantastic business model of allowing customers to brew/bottle their own beer, they also have a nice bar & restaurant area up front and extremely tasty food.  Everyone there was seemed to be having fun and was really friendly.  Even though the brewing area was busy, we received good service and had a good time chatting with the staff and other fellow beer brewers.  

Protip: Get the smoked wings with dry rub.  Some of the best I've ever had.

Protip 2: Don't shy away from preparing your own brew.  The instructions they give you are very easy to follow and the staff is there to help if you need it.  The whole process generally takes 2-3 hours;  YMMV.  Then you come back in a few weeks for bottling!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre food.  Yes, you may have an extensive beer list but that is easy.  You have to make an effort with food.  Pulled pork sandwich was okay, baked beans were out of a can.  Cole slaw was okay.  I kinda figured it would be 'just okay' and nothing on the table was great, sorry to say."}
{"text":"Ate here April 3rd. Beer was great, service was bad. As soon as sat down the waitress tried to rush us through our order. It was obvious later on she was trying to leave, as she was doing sidework and kept coming back to our table. Then she asked us if we wanted dessert when weren't even halfway finished with our food. We told her no, then she dropped off the check while we were still eating and drinking our flights of beer (they call them samples). We paid then she rushed back over to grab check then said to other waiters that she was leaving. We usually tip 20% but we didn't this time, bad service. Note to management, if servers rush customers through their food, it leaves a bad impression. The only reason i didn't complain to management is because i just drove from Nashville and we were tired"}
{"text":"Honestly, I love the food and the craft beers here. I have never been disappointed. The jalapeño corn bread is to die for and the wings are absolutely amazing! That being said, the service is less than great. The past few times that we've been there we were not happy with our server. I think the place has grown so much in popularity, that they feel they don't have to sweat the small stuff (like their customers' feelings) anymore. We went the other night with a group of four for my husbands birthday. The waitress was nice enough in the beginning, although slammed with a lot of people. For this reason, we overlooked the fact that she never came to clear our plates and we sat talking with the dirty plates on the table for quite a while. My husband and I spent about $100 and our friends spent $65, including a growler that they purchased for my husband. We had a fun night talking and reminiscing and we were there quite a while, but the place had emptied out and there were plenty of open tables. We paid our bills and each of us tipped her about 25%. After signing our credit card slips, we let them sit at the table and we continued talking. I was suddenly so dehydrated! I saw the waitress and said, \"hey, can I just get a glass of water?\" She barely answered and I sensed an inner eye roll, but she brought me a glass of water. Very snotty. Then, my husband opened his growler and poured a bit in his empty glass that was sitting there foreverrr...and she came over and snapped \"you can't open that and drink it in here\"...he stupidly kept pouring as he said \"really?\" She just repeated very nastily, \"you CAN'T open that here!!\" So he stopped and she walked away. We were all taken aback at how she changed from being courteous to being nasty once the bill was paid. Both of us grabbed our bills and changed our tip from 25% to 10% just because it made us feel good. Go for the food and the drinks but don't go with the thought that you will be treated as a valued guest. Because, you are not. There are plenty more where you came from. At least that's how they make you feel. They need to up the anti on their manners and attention to detail. As my husband said, \"yeah, the food and beer is good BUT there are many places that have good food and beer.\" So true."}
{"text":"The beer is good. I enjoyed that part. The service was slack, at best. The food was average. All in all, I would have given it 3 stars, but the \"add-ons\" make it a two-star review. The $10  burger with pulled pork and bacon doesn't come with cheese, but you can add a slice for 75 cents. You get to choose sweet potato fries as a side but it doesn't come with sauce. Etc, etc.  This place doesn't offer you much for your money. Lots of better options out there."}
{"text":"Great brewpub!  Large microbrew beer selection (a lot of which they brew on site) and really good pub food. I had a TBK Octoberfest which was 16oz of carmelly, malty heaven (so good I had a second) and a plate of the smoked wings. The place is located in some sort of older strip mall, and the dining area is broken up into a few separated sections - make sure you get seated in the main bar section. The service is faster, the decor is pretty cool, and they have a few big screen TVs.  I'll be back!!
I also understand that you can brew your own batch for a fee at certain times of year. If I was not from out of town, I'd look into this in closer detail."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars/breweries to visit. Been here many times, and enjoy it every time. The food and the beer are both excellent. The location is pretty close to 71, making it easy to get to.
The beer here is outstanding. Their regular beers, their seasonal brews, their experimental and small batch beers are all excellent. I have yet to have a TBK beer that I have disliked, aside from styles I personally do not enjoy. The Big Woody is one of my personal favorite brews from here that is a year-round selection and frequently available. This isn't just a location that only carries their own beers, but they carry an enviable selection of beers from other breweries as well.
The food here has never disappointed. I have had or tasted a wide array of their option from the Chicken Parma-Que to the meatloaf sandwich, Perch Tacos to Triple Pig, Brat burger to Backyard Sampler. Each and every time I have left here full and satisfied. Another positive with their food is a variety of options as side dish with your meals, including sweet potato fries and deep fried green beans, where there isn't even an upcharge for these unique options.
Whether a craft beer connoisseur or just looking for a good meal, TBK is worth a visit every time."}
{"text":"So close to 5 stars.  

They make great beer.  The White Raja, Winter Warmer and 4C's are my favorites.  The BBQ is amazing.  The wings and gumbo are guaranteed to blow your mind.  The BBQ spaghetti is one of their specialties but I just can't get used to it.  Don't worry there are plenty of amazing choices. I hit this place on my way in and out of Cleveland as often as I can.  

The people are always friendly and happy to chat with you about making and drinking beer.  

Go Browns!"}
{"text":"We were told 20-25mins for 2 people. We waited 55 minutes. Service was extremely slow. Good bar food & great beer selection."}
{"text":"i hate to even review The Brew Kettle as it's been a while since i've been there, and i've only been there twice. 

nothing i had there was bad - except the pineapple beer, but nothing was incredible either. the first time there i had the Chicken Parma-Que - chicken parmesan in a barbecue flavored tomato sauce. i found it to be too sweet. not terrible, but not something i'm dying to have again. 

The next time there i had a beer battered cod sandwich. the sandwich itself was perfectly good - fresh and fried nicely. the problem was the \"tartar\" sauce, and this is just personal preference - i enjoy a basic white trash, relish and mayo tartar sauce. their's is a little fancy for my taste. i'm not even sure what was in it. that said, it wasn't terrible, but just didn't hit the spot for me. 

One of these days i'll go back because there are a few more items on the menu that interest me. and the beers are terrific (except the pineapple one). the staff seems friendly and the service has always been good."}
{"text":"Meh it's ok and a little pricey for overglorified bar food. I've made beer there which is cool but more of a novelty than anything else."}
{"text":"Great staff and the food is always awesome!! I don't think it's possible for them to cook anything bad."}
{"text":"We had a party of 7 dine here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  This included 3 children.  

The menu is a wide selection, fit for every taste.  Of course the beer selection is strong, including a number of homemade brews.

I had the pulled pork on a burger...very good and generous portions.

This is a good place to get to.  We will be back next time we are on that side of town."}
{"text":"Wasn't overly impressed but it's a classic beer joint I'd consider it above average. honestly my favorite part was the dipping sauces not that I have much use for them but they were awesome"}
{"text":"Great place for BBQ and beer.  The service is decent and the appetizers are okay.  The jalapeno cornbread is a huge portion but slightly dry.  The BBQ is plenty juicy and falls off the bone quite easily.

Overall the place has a extensive simple menu that tastes good.  Come here if you need something simple and need a beer."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going there for years!  We love this place and use to go no less than once a week.  The food is always fresh and wonderful and the sauces are all homemade, like the hot mustard sauce that comes with the big pretzel, that stuff will light you up!!  Must have Wasabi and Horse Radish in it?  A great ever changing list of craft beers along with their own TBK beers.  We love this place but moved an hour away so now we only get there about once a month but still love the place just as much!"}
{"text":"Apparently, our friend was driving cross country a while back and decided to arrange his route so he could try out different brew-pubs every night.  This was one of the places he stopped at and absolutely loved, so when we were driving through the area on the way to Cedar Point he got really excited and said we MUST MUST stop here.  As a beer-lover myself, I am glad we listened to him!

The beer list was stellar, and I liked how they provided brief descriptions of all the beers and how we could expect them to taste.  We ended up getting several pitchers of their own brews, all but one of which I loved.  The milk stout in particular was amazing, the irish stout, and there was one that had corriander (sp?) as an ingredient that was really unique.  Loved the beer!  The pitchers were about half the price of a good pitcher at a restaurant in DC.  As for the food, the guys all had hot wings and I had a grilled cheese sandwich with thick juicy bacon on it.  Good, but I would call it average pub fare.  

The atmosphere was cool too - there were circular tins of old beer labels all over the walls - fun to look over for recognizable brands or funny pictures.  Ironically we were seated facing a funny label of a dog humping some legs - we had literally just been having a conversation involving dog humping in the car when we pulled up.  The labels generally were really fun, the service was prompt and friendly and there was a good crowd.  The place was also huge!  We had a great time here enjoying some beers and taking in the atmosphere and next time I'm heading by here I would definitely like to stop again."}
{"text":"Got there early on a Sunday and it was not too busy. Seems like more of a place to enjoy a game than for food. 

+ Great beer selection. Was a fan of the White Rajah
+ $2.50/beer on Sundays!

- Table was a bit sticky
- Food was okay. Had the Triple Pig which was huge but the meat was a bit dry."}
{"text":"Beer is like moldy maple syrup.  We tried five kinds and gave up.  Yuck"}
{"text":"Great spot in the Strongsville area. Doesn't seem much from the outside until you get inside. This walls are plastered with different beer memorabilia on the wall, looks great. It's mainly bar and booth seating inside. They brew some of their beer in a different room at this location, towards the back they have another room were you can brew your own beer, something I'll have to try next time I visit this location.
They have a great beer selection, and the food is great."}
{"text":"This is a place I used to sit in for hours, getting shitty and talking trash to the regulars and staff, but all good things must end and I have not beer here much lately and It's not coincidence. Why the change? Well, while The food has always been decent it isn't special either. I do love the slaw. The beer list is much better than it used to be, but it lacks local beers(they do have more now than they did before) and their house beer, outside of White Rajah and Jackhammer, are not great. I think it boils down to a change in atmosphere. When they added seats, the place cut down the wait times but lost character.  Also the ownership change created turnover in the staff and customers. I see the old crew now drinking mostly at Fat Head's these days."}
{"text":"I tried the pumkin beer,  I didn't know if I was going to dig it.  I would absolutly drink it again and again"}
{"text":"Reviewing the restaurant:  My wife and I love this place and bring our friends and out-of-town guests.  The food is great and the beer choices always interesting.  There was an issue with being seated (No host/hostess and people walking in past the line and seating themselves) but that seems to be taken care of.  The atmosphere is hie wherever they seat you.  Only drawback - if you bring someone who wants a well  known beer, they won't be able to get it (usually not an issue).  The brew-your-own part of the business is fun if you're really into it - worth a try once if you're interested."}
{"text":"Love this place! Unique food choices, great beer and adventurous beer making opportunities."}
{"text":"Beer selection is immense! Love the menu!! Prompt service. Food was good!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and drink.  Unless your bartender is Josh.  If it's Josh I bet you'd have a better time buying a 6 pack and drinking at home.  The dude is a tool and super rude to customers."}
{"text":"I am hoping that someday I will find that happy medium where a good beer place will also have good food. It seems to be that more often than not, when a place has a great focus on beer, that food is not normally something to write home about.

I was visiting in town with my GF and parents and we tried out this place.  Everyone got a selection off their Beer menu *( no domestic beers here).. and that seems to go over pretty ok. They even offer a sampler of 5 or more.

We started off with the buffalo chicken dip -- maybe i am spoiled by the dip I make at home-- as this seemed just too processed.

They have a wide variety of meals to choose from... from  nachos, pulled pork, perch tacos, BBQ spaghetti.... topped with pulled pork .....  

We ordered Chicken Parmaqueue... Wisconsin Brat Burger.... Steak sandwich... and the lamb burger.  Service was fast and friendly, and the food was just ok.  Nothing to write home about.  I think there is a lot of potential there if they would focus on fewer items from the menu..... and allowed those to be perfect. I really liked the idea with the chicken Parmesan spin with BBQ sauce... it was interesting, and I think it can be really good. 

They seems to have a ton of specials.... its written all over the placement.  

Charming place, I would come back probably for drinks and appetizers... but not yet for dinner......"}
{"text":"How the heck have I not reviewed this?  I'm at TBK entirely too often.  It's my typical \"first date\" location...and it seems like I've had one too many of them lately.  I'm a huge fan of getting a sampler of some of their delicious beers and I almost always get the mac & cheese with andouille sausage.  So, so yummy!"}
{"text":"A cool concept, with decent beer.  The food was bland so I would go back for drinks only.  I was a little confused why I had to order at least 5 samples in order to get a sample tray.  That rule didn't change when they ended up being out of one of my choices.  Weak."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and drink.  Their craft beers were great.  We had the flights of beer to try all there home craft beers.  The food was Class A.  This is a place I will be going back to for the food and beer."}
{"text":"A very pleasant surprise in Cleveland while traveling for business. Food, drinks, bar service and management made for a perfect evening out."}
{"text":"Very good food and very good service. The dry rub wings are a must have. Lots of great beer choose choices as well."}
{"text":"I wasn't in the best of moods to begin with when I stopped in for lunch last week, so being ignored for 5 minutes while we were standing at the door waiting to be seated didn't sit well with me.  Seriously, we stood at the \"please wait to be seated\" sign and watched the bartender and several servers look right at us and continue on with what they were doing.  If someone would have just given us a \"we'll be right with you\" that would have sufficed.  But I do not do well with being ignored.  I finally asked the bartender what the deal was and she said a server would be right over.  One of the waitresses picked up on my stank face and seated us shortly after, but I already had formed my opinion on this place based on the initial service and it was not good.  
The food was OK.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac & cheese and my boyfriend ordered a burger.  The pork and the mac & cheese were decent, but nothing that knocked my socks off.  My boyfriend said the burger was good but he liked his appetizer of beer and sausage soup better.  
The whole make your own beer concept seems cool and unique to the area and I give them props for that.  But as far as the restaurant goes, I've been to better bar/grille/pub joints.  I'll probably give The Brew Kettle one more chance...hopefully I have a better experience to write about after!"}
{"text":"OH, Brew Kettle, I want to love you but you're just missing that something that makes me want more. Your atmosphere is nice but a little to chain restaurant feeling to me. Maybe it's the new addition that makes me feel this way? 

I also love beer and finding great draft selections is always a new challenge. You deliver on that point but from there it was downhill. You give good beer with OK service.  It's cold & uninterested- basically you just want to give me beer and not make any conversation, ask if I'm enjoying my beer or even offer me a food menu. AND, after sitting for 20 minutes with empty glasses you clearly don't care to serve us anymore.

Such a bummer brew kettle. If you cannot get your act together at 2:30PM on a Tuesday with only 10 people at the bar then you probably cannot handle much more."}
{"text":"So the food is always great. The beers are fantastic. Our waitress was very personable. The problem was lack of staff. Stopped on a Sunday afternoon and had to wait for everything. When I politely asked the waitress where she had been she said she had the ten tables around us and about 50 people in the back. And she still did the best job she could given her overload of customers. Get more help!"}
{"text":"I went with my mother and we usually always have a great time. However, I had not been back since they remodeled and I can now see why. I think the place has great food hands down. I cannot comment on the beer because I only go for the food. My food was great but my mother's salad had a lot to be desired. 

My mom advised the waitress that her salad was not that good. The waitress said \" I'm sorry\" and walked away. She did not offer to bring my mom something else nor did she offer to have the salad remade. My mom did not put up a fuss because we were under time constraints. However, she did call and speak with a manager later that day. The manager did not offer to send a gift card. She advised my mom the next time we were at the Brew Kettle to ask for her and she would see what she could do for us. 


Okay? I need not say more."}
{"text":"Last evening bitter and frigid temperatures turned our planned outdoor activities to the Brew Kettle for some warm food & cold beer. 

Alas, once again, the Brew Kettle lets me down on food. Every time. How difficult are good nachos? How difficult is a dry rub for wings? What's more, can you really claim suicide brownies when they are dry & not chocoliscious at all? Even the consistency of the ice cream was all wrong. Hint: brownies should be hot and capable of melting the ice cream. 

The goods: 
Beer. 
Get some 
Drink some 
Enjoy! It is delicioso!!! 

Skip das food. Drink das bier!"}
{"text":"Nothing's brewing at this kettle.  Big group of us so everything took foooooorever.  We were not impressed with the food.  My chick parm sub was over fried so my breading was almost black not golden brown, and tasted like burnt grease. Sweet potato fries were way soft..  I like crispy.  Coleslawful was almost inedible.  2 bites I was done. Wife's Veggie burger was mushy and too thick, but she did like her fried green beans.  Prices were fair."}
{"text":"No matter what your heart desires - excellent craft beer or smoked wings/BBQ you are in the right place. 

The Buddha burger, Parma Que platter, Pulled Pork sandwich, dry rub smoked wings, Gumbo, jalapeño cornbread - all so worth a stop here.  Fish N Chips are good but greasy, same with the sweet potato fries.  

The Orgefest in February is when the high percentage beers are all on tap - Jackhammer & Bourbon Aged Jackhammer - snatch them up during this!  The standard BK beers are good - but only a few stand out to me - however a sampler tray is the way to go each time! 

We have brewed beer four times with these guys and they are awesome! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food is great and atmosphere is excellent. Great place to go local and relax. I recommend the spicy mustard!"}
{"text":"Great food (accordingly to my brother in law since we ate before meeting up with him) and the variety of beers were top notch.  Loved their pumpkin beer."}
{"text":"We saw that this place had a lot of good reviews so we decided to try it out. They were pretty busy when we got there, but we got seated right away. That's about as good as it got. We didn't see much on the menus that even sounded good, but I'll give any thing a try. I understand they were busy, but they should know how to deal with it. We never got greeted by anyone other than the person that sat us. No one ever took our drink order or anything. It was busy so we stayed patient and waited. We sat there for about 30 minutes before we decided that nothing even sounded good so why sit here so long before we even got our drink order taken. They need to get more organized. We haven't been back after that and I don't think we ever will. Gave two stars just because we didn't even try the would so I can't say it was completely awful."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  great beer selection with a waitress who knows how to help pick a beer for your taste, food was splendid at a reasonable price, I've been here before and I will continue to highly recommend."}
{"text":"Totally done with this place. Crappy attitudes from the host staff. Waits that are twice as long as they say they will be. Ugh. Done done done."}
{"text":"Awesome place!   Great beer options and food is good .....  Lots of options.  Staff is really nice and owner mark is very nice as well!"}
{"text":"First time here.  IPA's are great no question. But food made me decide not to return. Got chicken wings.  Were red inside pink on meat and blood red spots and streaks on bone and bone socket and tendon.  Returned to kitchen. Waitress brought back my original order saying \"Kitchen said don't worry that's just pink from being smoked.\"  But there were red spots not just pink.  I didn't eat it.  Later checked with friend who is inspector for Texas Dept of Health.  He said smoked chicken is pink.  Red spots mean raw/uncooked, especially near bone.  Don't appreciate this place's OH TRUST US approach."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is always great. They are a smokehouse and taproom. They have some of the best barbecue in Ohio. The portions are huge and very tasty. I recommend the mac-n-cheese and the dry rub wings. The ribs are great as is the BBQ spaghetti, think Cinny chili but actually good. They have a huge variety of craft beers including several which are brewed on site. Speaking of which you can use their equipment, supplies & recipes to brew your own beer, At lease 50 options. You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Where to begin...

Small gem that is located in a tiny strip mall.  Awesome house brewed beer and fantastic guest beers on draft as well.  Came here last Thursday night and had a few 12 oz snifters of their Imperial IPA which was 9% ABV and only $3.75!!  Great deal for a great tasting beer with a punch.    
The food is delicious.  The smoked dry-rubbed wings are fall off the bone f**king outstanding!!.  I LOVE THE WINGS HERE!!  Had the meatloaf grinder for Friday lunch which was also great.  The meatloaf was made in house and smoked as well.  Proper BBQ and homemade food here and they also allow you to brew/bottle your own beer in the back.

Come here a few times per visit.  Best prices on beer and one of the best selections of hard to find brews in Cleveland area.  Always packed, but best place to go drink beer and eat awesome hearty homemade bar food!  
I wish they stayed open later than 10pm."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch to visit an old friend.  The food remains awesome!  I wanted to have a few  beers but work got in the way of that.  So I settled for Root Beer.  (I know).  Anyway...this is always a staple for great food, beer, and vibe."}
{"text":"I used to come here frequently and I was never disappointed. The food, atmosphere, and beer were great. Now the only good thing is the beer, which I can get at Giant Eagle. Since the original owners were bought out, it has been swirling the bowl. The servers are rude & the last time I ate there most of the table had burnt and disgusting food. It's too bad this place is only a shadow of its previous glory."}
{"text":"Was super excited to visit, as I love White Rajah. However, after waiting an hour for an \"it'll only be 20 minutes\" table we left. The place was nothing like i expected and was a generic restaurant style with taps - not a real brewpub in the vein of Goose Island or Fat Heads. The people working there knew nothing about their beer or the company or even that they had an offsite production facility. Staffed with slow, didn't-give-a-fuck service, i might as well have been at three floyds."}
{"text":"The Brew Kettle is a gem in suburbia. I am a regular and not sure how I haven't written a review till now, but better late than never. 

First, let's talk brews. After all, brew is in the name. The Brew Kettle makes some of the best micro brews in the area. My favorites include: Kitka Milk Stout, a creamy chocolatey coconutty heaven in a glass; Winter Warmer, a spiced holiday ale that is even better than the \"other\" holiday ale served at that \"other\" brewery up North (yeah, I said it!); and Summer Soulstice, a banana and clove Belgian Wit. Around 40 varieties of Brew Kettle Beer and guest brews are on tap each day so you are bound to find something you like. If you can't, you probably don't like beer. If that's the case, don't fret. Brew Kettle also serves wine and spirits. No need for anyone to leave without getting their drink on.

Second, the food. It's bar type food, but elevated. Wraps, salads, burgers, entrees...the menu is quite large. They make their own salad dressing so even if you don't want to go all gastro-pub you can dine on a salad and not feel you are completely missing out. The BBQ Spaghetti (made with pulled pork and cheese!) is a signature dish if you don't want to eat like a rabbit. 

Third, you can brew your own beer! They make it really easy to pick a beer, add the ingredients, and bottle it. What is NOT easy is getting an appointment because they are always booked way in advance. But of you can commit to a time in the distant future, you'll have a blast brewing it and a few weeks later you'll leave with way more beer than one human should ever carry home at one time.

And on a final note, Brew Kettle drafts are $2.50 and most pitchers are $7 all day Sunday. Not a bad way to spend a Sunday night before returning to the real world on Monday. See you there."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place based on reviews. It's a cool looking place great service but the bbq was below par. Wings were dry and hard , pulled pork was also dry, ribs were ok."}
{"text":"Ok I posted photo and video! Food was good. Waitress outstanding beer decent (saying a lot)  beer glasses completely filthy. The glasses I was given got progressively dirtier. The last one which I finally rejected was disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"The menu is varied.   The quality was good.   The music was unbearable.   It was necessary to shout at the people on the other side of the table to be heard.  We asked if the sound could be turned down a bit and were told it could not.  Not a good place to visit with friends unless you plan on just listening to the music.   Not a place to socialize with your guests,"}
{"text":"The wings are really good! But the buffalo chicken dip was bland. How can you mess up buffalo chicken dip? There were five of us who all agreed it wasn't so hot, we added a lot of hot sauce to it and that made it better. The sweet potato fries were pretty good but the dip that came with them was frozen solid. It took a while to get ahold of our waitress whenever we needed her and it always seemed like we weren't talking fast enough and she had somewhere else to be. The brew kettle beers were also just so-so."}
{"text":"Top-notch beer selection with a lengthy menu full of highly unhealthy but delicious food options. I went with the Brew Kettle All For One and the BBQ ribs with cole slaw. Both were great. 

As for the ambiance, it seems to have outgrown itself from the plaza it currently resides in so I am excited to try the newer, larger taproom that's opening down the street in the near future. 

I did take a peek at the brew-your-own-beer section in the back, and it was crowded with people bottling and applying labels to their brews. My husband brewed a beer there recently, and it turned out really good - a honey tinted IPA. They let him apply his own labels, and we are still trying to chip away at the 72 some bottles he brought home."}
{"text":"Love this place. the pulled pork nachos are the best, and the backyard sampler is awesome if you like bbq. I could eat here everyday."}
{"text":"The wife and I hit up the Brew Kettle on my last trip home for the holidays. A huge and LONG space with the bar and dining room up front and the lively brewery and brew-on-premise operations out back. On Christmas Eve-Eve the place was packed at 2pm as we arrived for a late lunch so we decided to grab an easy seat at the end of the bar. We were promptly greeted and ordered a couple of their hoppier offerings. I forget the exact names, but both were declared solid and quite satisfying to these two hophead beer snobs. On to the food. If barbecue is on the menu then barbecue is what I'm having! The pulled pork sandwich was a knockout. The tangy sauce served on the side (the mark of someone who is confident in their 'cue!) was a great touch and the accompanying fries and cole slaw  tasted homemade and were both delicious. Service was very prompt and friendly especially taking into account that the place was packed to the gills, but my guess is that this place never gets too quiet. If I still lived in Cleveland, I'd definitely sign up for a brewing class, but alas TBK will just have to remain a delicious stop on future trips home to see family."}
{"text":"I am typically I'm not impressed with bar type food, but this particular place was out of the normal. I had come here because of the pulled pork.   I was told their sandwiches were to die for. I have to agree, they are excellent.
The spend it was quite enjoyable as well as the buffalo dip. The rest of my party had no complaints. One thing I did enjoy was the coleslaw. Also the milk stout coconut beer.
One thing that I do want to point out you should pay particular attention to the beer menus prices. A fine choice and beer was the milk stout with coconut mix it was quite good. Have fun and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Second batch of beer for this year is in the barrel getting tasty! What is Brew Kettle you ask? Well let me regale you with the latest in liquid courage. 

Brew Kettle is an establishment that fronts as a bar with 20-or-so taps of varietal beers ranging from the lights to seasonals to some imperial greats. A flavor for anyone's palette. Bar food is better than normal. I'm a big fan of the meatloaf, any pork product from the menu (there are quite a few), and the coveted spicy mustard that everyone raves about. There is a reason for it. Its DAMN good! Tonight I went with a few different beers, a Harvest Ale, the Two Brothers Heavy Handed, and Breckenridge Lucky. My personal fav is the Breck as its got the right amount of hoppiness to make my lips curl. 

So the bar and pub in the front; microbrewery in the back. The Brew Kettle has their own line if micros which vary on the taps. The brewery provides everything one needs to brew a batch of their beer on premises. You can follow the recipes provided or roam off on your own into Never-never-will-I-stop-brewing-beer Land. We generally choose to follow recipes as they have been tested, have true descriptions, and will also result in the batch of beer you expect. Experimenting can have disastrous results from what I've heard. So for a nominal fee ($120-150) you get to mix, cook, and brew your own beer. The B-Kettle monitors and stores as the yeast does its duty on your brew. 3-5 weeks later you come back and bottle it. By the way, you can definitely make your own labels as well. My last batch was a Honey Wheat Ale entitled Gazelle. Yum! The result is close to 75 20oz bottles of beer. A deal in my book. And good beer to boot! 

So if brewing beer is an interest of yours, make a reservation. If friends of yours enjoy beer reserve a few kettles for a small brewing and drinking party. This place is all-kinds of fun and really good beers and food to follow it up."}
{"text":"I don't get to go to the Brew Kettle often, but every time I have I was not disappointed. Depending on the day and time of day you go, it can be pretty busy. It was not busy today at 5:30pm on a Monday. 

The service is always very pleasant and the servers are very knowledgeable. They have have an extensive menu of beers which change regularly. They offer smaller samples for $2 or so. The food menu is diverse, but I always revert to my favorites: original dry rub wings and the big soft pretzel with the spicy mustard. They might be the best wings in the area. The prices are very reasonable as well. My good friend who is a vegetarian has numerous choices to choose from. 

I will come back numerous times, and already looking forward to the next visit!"}
{"text":"Forget the beer or the food for just a moment -- you need to know my favorite part of this restaurant -- The mustard. I know what you're thinking, and yes, I am somewhat stupid. The mustard though is amazing. It's a punch in the face, almost as though a mischievous sushi chef slipped a bit more wasabi onto your tuna roll. I walked in with a somewhat soggy sinus cavity, and walked out as though I came out of a mid-80's Halls commercial. I could breathe again!

Mustard aside, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food, as well as the cleanliness of the joint. While the menu is your typical bar food offerings, there are lots of them. As far as food goes, while we toured the brewpubs and tap houses of the Cleveland area back in the summer of 09, we found it to be one of the best of the bunch, just behind Fat Head's and Great Lakes. Everything is quality, and seems to be far from the \"let's just pick it up at Sysco and make it\" sort of place that predominates the bar food scene here in Cleveland. What surprised me more than anything was the more than serviceable, more than pretty good BBQ they've got working. Barbecue spaghetti may not seem good, but trust me -- it's fantastic. Italians who love slow simmered pork in their sauce will love it, and smokeheads who love a fine smoked meal will dig it too. 

The beers are also winners, though they're a bit IPA and hop heavy. I'm a huge hop head, and often times, the hoppier the better. But, there's more than just hops out there. Thankfully, their not-so-hoppy offerings are solidly as good as any in town. And that they have \"guest beers\" or beers from other breweries around the country is great, too. There's usually something for everyone.

I was surprised that a place in a strip-mall just in front of a Home Depot could be this good. It placed solidly in third in our countdown, and any beer lover would have a great night out here."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at The Brew Kettle last night.  I had the triple pig sandwich and my husband had the backyard sampler.  Both meals came with one side and we chose french fries.  He upgraded his slaw to soup and I upgraded to salad as we neither one like horseradish, a component in their slaw.  The salad wasn't bad if you could overlook the moldy tomato.  I ordered my dressing on the side and while it was in a cup, the server had partially tipped the cup so that some dressing had spilled and pooled on my plate.  My husband's sausage and beer gumbo was good.  The beer flavor was there but not overbearing.  It was quite spicy, though.  Our meals came quickly and were served hot.  My sandwich was HUGE and his plate was full of meat and fries."}
{"text":"This place is a little too popular for it's own good. Came in on a Friday at 9:30 to find the place slammed. The layout of the place was strange and the hostess stand is in the middle of the long restaurant. 

We stood at the bar for a while and neither bar tender even looked at us and no one, even employees hanging around the bar, attempted to help us get a beer.

The wait for a table was 15 minutes, not bad, but the atmosphere away from the bar was a little 'strip mall' for me. And it was awkward standing in the middle of the restaurants as people walked by constatly. 

On to what they offer. Full menu specializing in BBQ. Didn't try any of it, obviously. Beers they had listed with name, decription, price on two chalk boards. One above the bar and one in the middle dining room. They had about 15-20 craft and domestic (few) on tap. Most beers were $4.50 (domestic) to $5.50-$6 (craft) a pint. Of course, didn't try any of those either.

Lets just say, we drove up Pearl Rd. to Beir Haus to be warmly welcomed and promptly served even though the bar was full and I got my Pumpking pint draft for $4 instead of $5.50 from Brew Kettle."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving. From the outside the place looks kinda dumpy but what a pleasant surprise when you go in. It's got a bar and grille feel to it for sure but the beer selection is great, prices very reasonable. Service was good, place was packed on a snowy Thursday night, although I guess Clevelandars take the snow in stride and that doesn't keep them from going out.

My business associate and I both had the ribs and they was very good, although they're supposed to be dry rub and they were, however they put sauce on them also...kinda strange but still good.

Give them a try, you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"Split rating 
First of all , I had the smoked wings .
Incredible , some of the best I have had .
No domestic beer ,major bummer .
So I try some of their craft beer.
Not a fan , not good , how could someone drink this stuff ? 
Waitress was good , not great ."}
{"text":"This guys is hidden in an unusual strip mall, but well worth the stop.  The bar is long and narrow and filled with beer fun!  I haven't really branched out too far on the menu, the pulled pork for me is where its at.  Definitely get Mac n Cheese as the side and your can't go wrong!  They have a large variety of beers on tap!

I hear the brewing process is awesome, but unfortunately I haven't been able to get a spot yet.  (They are super booked for months)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming here for years, and tonight was the most disappointing thing ever. The food and beers are normally fabulous, which is why we drove out from Mayfield Hts for it. The quality of food tonight was absolutely horrible, from an appetizer that was half the size as it normally was to 2 of the \"same\" steaks that came out as 2 entirely different cuts of meat. Mine was clearly cheaper than my boyfriend's, and completely overcooked. When sent back, I was questioned as to why a steak I ordered medium rare, that came out with no pink, wasn't right. 

We were also served our meal with a side missing, and we had to point it out to our server to get it. Our steaks were also served, both times, without steak knives.

We did complain to our waitress, who promptly sent the manager over. He barely listened to our complaints, made some excuses, and offered free dessert. He then NEVER BROUGHT IT TO US. We had been sitting there so long that our waitress had to ask what we were waiting on, and then got it for us herself. 

Will most likely never go back...if not for the manager's complete arrogance and disrespect. So sad to see a great place end up like this."}
{"text":"Good place.  The Parma Que is amazing.  If I had a critique it would be to keep the beer list updated"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was a different story. She brought our box but no bill. Been waiting for at least 10 minutes and she has not been back. She also only brought 2 cups of water for 4 people."}
{"text":"This is one of the places we going out for lunch on Fridays.
One of my favorites.
Pulled pork
Smokehouse Wings
Sausage and Beer Gumbo
Barbecued Spaghetti - OMG

And my favorite beer is big woody"}
{"text":"Don't know why it has so high reviews on yelp. We 4 friend went on Sunday evening just to grab some beers and snacks. 

Wait time was too high. If I go for beer, I expect beer to be quick.. Food can take as much time.. But every thing took time here. 

One of my friend was vegetarian.. He ordered hummus. How can someone spoil hummus.. Well they did.. 

Fish and fries were average at best.. Smoked chicken wings ok. 

We had to cut our evening short and get out as soon as possible.. Evening spoiled :("}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed after reading the positive reviews for this place. I can't comment on the beer because I did not have any but from others in my group they enjoyed the various selections. I had a Chocolate Martini, which was really bad. I don't know how they make it but it was really off from any other one I've ever had. 

Now the most important part: The Food. Wow, was I really disappointed. My husband and I split the backyard sampler. It same with ribs, chicken wings, pulled pork with a side of fries and cole slaw. The pulled pork was extremely watery and the barbeque on it was really bland. The ribs were not cut correctly so most of the rib was pure fat. The chicken wings were actually really tender and juicy. The fries were just like any other place but still good. I do not like cole slaw so I did not eat that. I did order a side of Mac n' Cheese and that was so creamy and just plain ole good. 

I personally would not go back to this place unless I was with another group that wanted too. The barbecue was really bad and since that is a lot of there menu you are limited to other options. If you want good barbecue drive to a City BBQ or Montgomery Inn do not waste your money at this place."}
{"text":"this place is ok.  Not sure why everyone was raving about it.  Had the wings, have had better at even the chain places like BWW, TGIFridays, Applebees, and Chili's.  Tried their prime rib since a couple co-workers said it was good.  Not good at all.  Too much fat to meat ratio (not that I don't appreciate fat, but I appreciate some good meat on my prime rib!)  Not entirely impressed.  

Reason for not giving it 1 star was that the staff was very kind and looked like they cared enough to check in often to make sure we were ok.  Appreciated the service."}
{"text":"Come here with a large group and we always have good services.
I would recommend the Mac & Cheese with broccoli and the burger.
For beers there solicit wheat is one of the best in Cleveland. 
And you can always try a beer sampler!"}
{"text":"If you're into boring, yellow pisswater psuedobeer whose only benefit is its ability to keep your kidneys clean, don't bother coming here. You'll only stink up the joint. If you're into high-quality, flavorful and unique local craft beer you've gotta head to Brew Kettle. The folks here brew some of the best beer in the region but they're way more than that.

First, if you're into brewing your own beer the Brew Kettle has a BOP (brew on premise) option that allows you the opportunity to work with their professional brewers to craft your very own brew. They provide the recipes, the ingredients and the help. You end up with 72 22oz bottles of killer suds. Not a bad trade. I've never done it (I'm a homebrewer so my brewery is in the garage) but it sure seems like a great way to get introduced to the world of brewing. It'll cost you about $140 when it's all said and done. You can also make your own wine if that's your thing.

Second, did I mention the beer? Brew Kettle is an award-winning Ohio brewery and their brewmaster, Jack Kephart, is a genius with a mash tun. They've got 30 taps, a mix of house and visiting beers, flowing with some of the greatest (and freshest) selections around. Their White Rajah is one of the best IPAs I've ever tasted and if you want to give your palette a schooling in hops the 4-Cs Pale Ale will do the trick. I've never left this place thirsty and don't reckon I will. I suggest you get a flight or two so you can sample them all. BTW, you can find some of their product portfolio on the shelves of our local beer-selling type places. Buy some and show your local love.

Finally, the food. Go somewhere else with your inflated expectations of pretension and small portions. This is hearty, Cleveland fare done well. They smoke their own meats on premise, everything's made in-house and while I've only started to work my way through the list, I've yet to be disappointed. They've got a pretty extensive menu. If I remember correctly - things can get a little fuzzy after a couple of Red Rye PAs if ya know what I mean - it's about 5 pages long. With everything from burgers to BBQ it helps if you come hungry. Some of the standouts include the Wisconsin Brat Burger (A Seasoned pork burger on a pretzel roll with spicy kraut relish and Swiss cheese) and the fish and chips (no explanation needed). Their soft pretzels are also great beer companions. You can also get their BBQ to go if you need a lunch for the next day.

We've had nothing but good experiences during our visits to the Brew Kettle. Sure, we've been left wandering around up front a few times waiting for someone to seat us (that's why we eventually just walked back to the bar) and I wish they had something besides mustard with their soft pretzels (beer cheese dip...hint, hint) but these are minor issues soon forgotten once you've been embraced by the warmth of the breweriana inside. Love beer? Go here."}
{"text":"Been a fan since they opened many years ago. Best pulled pork in town. Great place to bring family or meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Had the burger topped with slaw and pulled pork and OMG was it great.  Burger was cooked a perfect med rare, the pork was juicy, the bbq sauce was sweet and the slaw crispy/creamy.  The sweet potato fries were handmade, crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside, with a cinnamon butter dipping sauce that was truly devine.  My mom had a pulled pork burrito overstuffed with lots of goodies.  I like beer, but am not to knowledgeable and the waitress walked me through a beer flight of samplers, and I loved them all.  They have something like a 100 beers on tap, served ice cold and my favorite (and something I would never have thought to order on my own) was a milk stout.  Creamy, with a hint of milk.  If I get back to Cleveland, they are on my repeat list."}
{"text":"I miss working in Strongsville, as I regularly visited this establishment for lunch and for dinner after work at times. Great beer, a creative menu with some interesting twists on bar food.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the discouraging strip-mall exterior- the Brew Kettle is great! They have an expansive beer menu, including their own house-brewed beers, which I always like to see. And not only is the beer menu expansive, the food menu is large as well. The outdoor seating is a little disappointing, but the interior has the classic, woody pub feel.

I ordered a fried fish sandwich with coleslaw and fried green beans and I was VERY happy with my meal. The fish was crisp and flavorful without being greasy, and the fried green beans were the same. I had some of my boyfriend's French fries and I was very happy with those as well. I will definitely be going back to the Brew Kettle.

The Brew Kettle: Good food and good (including house-brewed!) beer- and lots of it!"}
{"text":"Love the brew kettle. Different craft beer all the time (I'm not a beer person, but my dad is obsessed). The portobello mushroom sandwich is to die for and so is the veggie burger. Awesome sweet potato fries also."}
{"text":"Really open interior . Huge selection of taps . We got the 6 smoked wings . At first I'm like wow 13 bucks for 6 wings . But to my surprise they were whole wings which to most standards is 12 wings . We got the Kitka stout bbq and the Chinese sauce . Both spicy and pairs well with beer and dry rub on wings . Tbk flight beers are priced generous.  My only issue was out bartender was very lame and boring . Didn't seem interested in talking to us or exited to be working here in general . No good vibes ."}
{"text":"Everyone wants to make their own beer. Every single college kid has thought about buying those lousy brew-at-home kits. The Brew Kettle has just taken this and made it easy to craft good beer yourself. By providing you with nice equipment and premium ingredients, you can make way better beer than any home draft kit. I am planning a great German concoction with smooth caramel malts and some milder hops! Definitely a very cool business model and when you add up all your costs it is actually pretty cheap per beer. And it is FUN to make!

Their food and bar is pretty nice too. I ordered the Fish n Chips and was very happy with the portion size, presentation, and price. It tasted pretty good and it was very filling.  The coleslaw had dill in it and I liked the different taste. They went a little heavy with the parsley garnish but it didn't taste bad or anything. I will defiantly come back for more!

Well I'm off to brew my beers later this month, I will let you know how it goes!"}
{"text":"Here's a novel idea, When I call your hostess or manager or whomever answers the phone at 12:15 on a Saturday and ask if you take reservations, and your employee says yes we do, then I attempt to make a reservation for that night at 6:00pm and your employee then tells me we don't take reservations on Saturdays after 4:00!? Don't waste my time,
Give that information when answering the first question."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with Brew Kettle's food when I ate here a couple of weekends ago. I met up with some friends for dinner on a Friday night. We chose it simply because of location midway between our homes, so I wasn't particularly excited about the food until it came out! 

We started off with a beer at the bar while we waited for our table. The place was very crowded so we had to wait about 45 minutes for a table. I had a really good dark beer from the Brew Kettle's brewed beer list. It was very good. There were a lot of choices on tap, both Brew Kettle's beer and other popular brews. 

I ordered the pulled pork and coleslaw salad. It was huge and very tasty. It was a caesar salad piled high with pulled pork and coleslaw. The other dishes at the table looked great too. One person ordered meatloaf, the other two ordered the meat sampler plate. We all had enough leftovers to take home for lunch the next day.

Our waitress was nice and the service was fast especially considering it was a very busy Friday night.  Parking wasn't an issue either. There seemed to be plenty of space out front."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers, pretty decent food.  I came for the beer though.  This is a tip not a review I guess."}
{"text":"Good place to eat and drink. 

Good flight with a nice selection of beers.  Had their spaghetti with pork which was delicious. A very unique dish. Had a house salad with Dijon vinaigrette dressing which was very good. Friends had a chicken wrap and a brat burger which they both enjoyed."}
{"text":"Food average, had the dry rub wings and the kettle burger. Won't return, the server was nice though."}
{"text":"You don't need to be into craft brews to love this place. Best Smoked Wings in the state. Seriously. Then there's the Jalapeno corn bread served hot/large. Coleslaw is very tasty as well. Sure, they have some great brews made in town. As well as very good guest brew too."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Love Victoria as our server!!! The fish and chips are so delish and the homemade tartar sauce is my favorite. Great beer selection. If you get a chance to go to the yearly Ogrefest, do so!!! The menu for the fest is pretty wild!!!"}
{"text":"Pair the smoked wings with White Rajah and leave with knowing you have tasted the best in the city."}
{"text":"Let me just three words. AMAZIN SMOKED WINGS!!! Seriously. They're not the little ones that other places have either. They are full sized chicken wings. On Tuesdays they have a special that rivals that of BW3 and other places but I would rather go here, you get much better quality. I'm not a beer drinker at all but I will say that I've also heard great things about their beer. They brew their own. You walk in there and you just smell the fermentation and its wonderful. I did have their root beer. Lol it was pretty good so I guess that counts for something."}

by Mimi 12/30/2010 
I called ahead and was told no reservations for less than six. I explained that we were coming from 45 minutes away and would not be able to wait long - should we choose another place? The person on the phone said that since they expanded I would not incur the usual long wait. When we got there we were told 1 1/2 hours until we would be seated. The food is good but how they treat customers leaves something to be desired. My recommendation is to say you have a party of 6 and when you get there - oops! Some of them couldn't make it. Then you have a reasonable wait and no lies on THEIR part."}
{"text":"Love love love the Brew Kettle. Great beers, great food, great prices. Now that they have expanded they have lost a little of that hole in the wall charm, but still worth the visit."}
{"text":"2.5. Bad food at decent prices. Decent beer at good prices. Pretty decent staff but the setup is kinda of crappy, worn, and old. Feels like a waffle house tried to turn itself into a BBQ joint and brewery, which would make sense why the food is so bad..."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place.  Great BBQ, great beer selection, love the atmosphere, always quick and friendly service.   What more could you ask for from a neighborhood bar?   I drove from Florida for the BBQ spaghetti!  Chicken and sweet potato stew was excellent.   Great wings!   Love the coffee Stout :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Craft brew and BBQ?  Heaven on earth.  The food is great and the 4Cs Ale is outstanding."}
{"text":"A friend took us here for dinner while we were in town visiting.  Very large, extensive menu with a lot of selections for everyone.  I had the fish burrito with fries and a side of mac and cheese.  All was super yummy.  They had an awesome beer menu and selection, and homemade root beer that was awesome.  Place was super busy, but even with our large party, we did not wait long.  Service was super friendly and prices were very reasonable, if not cheap!  Would totally hang out here if I lived in Ohio.  Great place."}
{"text":"Still good, but just not what it used to be.    Burger not cooked properly and price up $2.  6 way chili not as good as it used to be.  Got rid of a la carte side salad.  Only salad now available is 5.99 unless you are subbing another side like fries.  Again, just not what it was before it was sold.  Too bad."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the area. The selection of beer is quite good, and they produce several quality beers. Examples include White Rajah, Old Route 21 and El Lupulo Libre. 

Their food sets them apart from most brew pubs. They have good quality dinners to go along with standard pub fare of burgers and sandwiches. The smoked wings are a treat. 

Folks interested in brewing their own beer can do so at this location. The wait list to Brew can be long, so call ahead to schedule. 

Wait staff have been uniformly friendly and helpful. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Update: Typically one of our favorite dining experiences in Strongsville due to the casual atmosphere and menu has now become a last ditch option...We stopped in for dinner and we're seated by the bar in a booth.  There was a very foul stench in the air like dirty dishwater.  It ruined the meal but my husband opted to stick it out.  One of his favorite sandwiches (chicken parmesan) no longer contains any chicken.  I thought BK had turned a new leaf when they resurfaced the tables, but it seems we'll just stay away for now."}
{"text":"So happy to have discovered this place as a nice break from being in a vehicle for such a long time! My husband and I were on an all day road trip from VA to IN. We were a little leary to go in based on the outdoor appeal. This is in a strip mall type shopping center and the exterior is not very inviting. The inside of the restaurant is quite large and reminded me of a sports bar. Definitely family friendly though. We sat at a booth by the bar, & our waitress was attentive & super friendly. She made us feel very welcomed. The beer list was exceptional! Tons of choices & styles of beer! My husband & I savored each of our beers, but we both only had 1 because we needed to drive the rest of the way to IN. Wish this place were closer to our house so we could come back regularly to try more. Oh, and the food was all made from scratch & incredibly delicious! I had the meatloaf, mashed potatoes & green beans. My husband kept wanting to eat my food. The portions were huge. I had so much left over that i put it in our cooler, and we both ate it for lunch the next day. I am drooling now thinking about that scrumptious meal! The Brew Kettle is definitely a diamond in the rough. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Place was hard to find as it is hidden in a little strip plaza. However, that belies the spacious warm feeling you get after you walk through the door. Nice atmosphere, great microbrew beer, and awesome food (I had the wings and sweet potato fries which were both excellent). I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"You can't beat the pulled pork and the great selection of beer. The pulled pork doesn't come with much BBQ sauce but get a side of it and your set!"}
{"text":"Our family has loved this place for a long time now.  We have brewed beer in the back, and it is a great time.  We also love to eat there.  Best coleslaw around and I actually don't love coleslaw.  BUT I love Brew Kettle Coleslaw.  The beer variety is great, and no matter what we try we seem to love.  Especially the ultimate mess pulled pork salad, the macaroni and cheese, the triple pig, buffalo chicken dip.  I could keep going, but just see for yourself!"}
{"text":"I like this place! I've been here for dates as well as to meet up with friends and I must say the food and beer has always been good. 

This place is located in a little plaza and doesn't seem very big, but there is actually plenty of room inside and a little patio in the back. As for service, hit or miss. Last time I was there the waitress was awful, but I've had good service before so hopefully she was just a fluke. Food wise I have really enjoyed the Ultimate Mess Pulled Pork Salad $9 and the Triple Pig $12. Both were very big portions! For beer I always suggest getting a flight of different ones to try out what the brewery has to offer, but I really enjoy the Kitka! It's a coconut chocolate milk stout and so delicious!

Pretty sure you can also take like a beer class or something here and they help you make a batch of beer."}
{"text":"Wide variety of beer. Making beer here is a great way to build a memory with friends and family. Service here is personable and friendly."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night at 9:30 pm and were waved away because they were closing. Really?  Yelp says you're open til 11?"}
{"text":"Good food, cold beer and excellent service.  All in all a great place to visit.   We recommend BK for a place to visit."}
{"text":"Hands down a five star hot spot!

From the moment I walked it to the moment I left I enjoyed this experience. As an out of towner yelping to find the next hot spot... This was the perfect example!

It's a local brewery, BBQ hole and employes friendly staff all in one. It's not every day that this happens and I would encourage anybody who has not been here to do so. Don't take my word for it, chek'it out!

I had the house brown ale with the meat sampler appetizer. While this was far too much for one person, the ribs, pulled pork and bbq chicken were all fantastic for a place that brews beer and bbq's too. 

When a consumer takes a step back and considers all facets to running a restaurant, this place is spot on.

Cheers, 

O"}
{"text":"Great craft beer and food. Busy on weekends. But the service is good and the beer cold. They have many house brews to choose from."}
{"text":"I went here for a business trip.  It did not live up to my standards.  It is more of a burger place."}
{"text":"Has always been consistently good.  Smoked wings are awesome, black bean sandwich is good, and the ribs are supposedly great (never had them yet).  Oh and the beer and good music is a bonus.  A very eclectic play list is usually playing."}
{"text":"I knew the Brew Kettle was a great micro-brew because I've tried a variety of their beers even living far away. So when I was up in the Cleveland area, I needed to give this place a try. Based on online reviews, I heard that the food was average. Don't be fooled by the location, this place sits in a small plaza, that could easily look like your average liquor store from the outside.

I first tried an order of wings with buffalo sauce. They were grilled to perfection and very delicious. Easily the the best wings I've had. I then went cheap I ordered the Monday special, \"The Brew Kettle burger with fries\" for $5.50. I wasn't expecting much with the burger, but after put all the fixings on it, I could barely put my mouth in it. It was that big and filling. The fries on the other hand, were simply average.

I ambiance of this place is also a plus with classis beer and bar memorabilia. For a Monday night, it drew a solid crowd during dinner. The beer menu and glasses they pair with each beer is awesome. I tried three unique beers and enjoyed them.

I will come back and would give this place 5 stars, but again, the fries were average and our server wandered off on many occasions."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Right near my work.  The Big Mess Salad is awesome.  A nice salad topped with cole slaw and pulled pork.  Tastes better than it sounds.  Food is hearty and way better than most bar food.  The place gets busy on weekend nights and you might have to wait.  

I brought my staff in one afternoon to make beer, which is their primary business.  I didnt know you dont really make beer in one afternoon.  You make it one afternoon and come  back a few weeks later and bottle it.  The bottling (tasting) is more fun.  Beer was very popular back at the office.  We customized the name of the beer and named them after our good customers.  Even dropped off a six pack at each customer.  Big hit."}
{"text":"Love the brew kettle. I am vegetarian and i love that i can go to dinner with my meat eating friends and all have a good time. their black bean (homemade) burger is a MUST! They also have many other vegetarian options! I would eat here everyday if i could A++++++++++++++++++++++++"}
{"text":"I love the Brew Kettle.  The draft beer selection is Awesome.  Their own brewed beer is awesome.  The service is awesome and the food is great.  I got a sandwich last time with pork tenderloin, pulled pork and bacon on it.  WOW!!!  It was excellent. I ha e been here several times and it never disappoints. You have to try it."}
{"text":"Wish there was a Brew Kettle in Westlake...good food, nice selection of tasty well priced craft beers, great service, and a fun crowd. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Good food and decent beer.  I assume better than decent if you are more experimental than I an appreciate hoppy IPAs.  Favorite menu item is burrito."}
{"text":"What's to say.    If u like good food u will love brew.   This place is truly a bbq joint on steroids.   Great smoke good beers and wines.   Help is good not great but all in all a 4."}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Ok bar food. Very loud. Hostess was more interested in talking to her friend than seating us, or even looking at us to let us know she knew we were there. Stood in front of her for 5 minutes until someone else told her we were waiting for a seat. She then left to seat her friends and was gone another 5 minutes.  Thankfully our waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"Good things:
- The beer list at the bar - If you like IPA, get the White Rajaa.  So good.
- The novelty - You can brew your own beer.
- The price to brew your own beer. You get a lot of beer. You pay for labels, bottles and materials. For a kettle, which makes 72 20oz bottles of beer, plus bottles and labels, the cost was about $225.  At the end of the day, that's just over $3 for a 20 oz bottle of beer.  Not too shabby. 
- When you bottle your beer, you can drink it.  If it weren't already your beer, it would be like you were drinking on the job.

Mediocre things:
- The menu. Selection wasn't great. If you eat there, you should get a salad with their house Italian dressing. It's the best thing on their menu in my opinion.
- The menu prices.  Not a great value. Not a complete rip off. 

Bad things:
- The wait to be able to brew your own beer. Waiting lists for certain days go 3-6 months. 
- The guy who guided us through brewing our own beer was kind of a douche bag. We had never done it before, and he was pretty demeaning and was not personable.  

Tips - 
- Try the beer before you buy it. Don't blindly select a particular type of beer... ask for some at the bar or they will sell you bottles back in the brewery. You don't want to end up with $225 worth of beer you don't like.  Not all Ales are the same.
- Keep your bottles so it's cheaper to do it again. They are pricey.
- Book your next trip when you're there the first time. 
- Wear clothes that can get dirty. You're brewing and bottling beer.  Also, the brewery smells like delicious hops, which can absorb into your attire.
- If you let your brew sit for a couple weeks after bottling, the ABV gets higher. Patience has it's rewards!"}
{"text":"The beer selection was pretty good. I ordered the wings along with the jalapeño cornbread. The wings are really not your traditional buffalo wings. They ended up being the entire chicken wing. The buffalo sauce was not really a so-so at all it was more spices that were made up to be a sauce I wasn't too crazy about the wings however the jalapeño cornbread was amazing even comes with the cinnamon and brown sugar butter spread that makes it taste especially good. Didn't really try any of the entrées but my girlfriend ended up having sausage and pirogues. They were pretty good as well so if you're going there for beer and then you end up with an appetite is still is a great place to be. Just don't get the wings there a far better place is if you're looking to get buffalo wings traditionally"}
{"text":"My friends and I had such a great time at The Brew Kettle!  We made 2 kettles and the process was interesting and fun.  The brew staff were knowledgeable and helpful.  The wait staff were attentive and friendly.  Can't wait to go back for the bottling process and bring our beer home!"}
{"text":"All around a darn good place!  I'm a fan of good microbrews and this place never disappoints.  They change their beer menu literally more than once a day, so it's guaranteed that every visit there will have a few new brews to try.  In addition, the food is all around pretty good.  I'm fairly limited with eating vegetarian, but there are at least a few things on the menu I can get.  Plus they accommodate without hesitation for food substitutions; such as, getting veggies in place of the pork with the BBQ spaghetti.  

Food wise, what I love about the place is the unique and 'gourmet' bar food selection.  I already mentioned the BBQ spaghetti.  Another favorite, which is an appetizer fit for a small meal, is the jalapeno cornbread with sweet butter spread.  It's not too spicy, but tastes amazing!  I regularly go with friends who try various other dishes from the menu, and none of them have had any complaints with the meat dishes they try."}
{"text":"Went there a few times. The smoked wings are the best wings I've tried, especially with their delicious homemade dill ranch. Will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"So I read the reviews and had to try the wings.....it was ok, yes just ok. The first bite wowed me but then 5 wings later I was wondering why, why am I eating this food! Great place to hang with your beer buddies"}
{"text":"We've eaten here five times. The food is quite fantastic, the staff is always very friendly and efficient, their beer and menu selection is huge.

They make everything in house, craft beer, sauces, dressings, and fresh ingredients. 

The restaurant layout is very cozy, spacious and clean.

We WANT to keep going back to patronize a local establishment that seems go be doing everything right, but unfortunately we can't. Every single time we have eaten here, we get incredibly sick - my parents and friends we have gone there with as well have had the same complaint. It took five visits to realize it wasn't a coincidence and anymore we were just being gluttons for punishment.

If you have a cast iron stomach, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"I love Brew Kettle beers. The White and Black Rajahs are delicious, and the Kitka is a great stout. Whats nice about going to the actual brewery is they have a lot more small batch stuff there. I got to try a stout on Nitro and one called Valravn, which was ridiculously good. They also had a bunch of local and some regional craft beers on tap as well. We were just passing through and our main reason to stop was to get food. Our waiter was also the bartender, so our service was definitely lacking. It took him forever to get our beer samples and even longer to get our food orders. 
They have a pretty big menu and they specialize in BBQ/smoked foods. We decided to split the smoked wings and the triple pig sandwich. The wings were the full two piece wings, and we ordered them with the dry rub which was delicious. I definitely recommend it. Any of the other sauces would just clash with the smoke flavor. The buttermilk dill, their version of ranch, was really great as well. The triple pig is insane. Its 12 inches of 3 different kinds of pork. It has thinly sliced pork loin, pulled pork, and bacon, piled ridiculously high on a nice crusty bread that is pressed. We ordered it with cheese, but they didn't put enough on so you couldn't taste it through all the meat. It also came with two sauces, a Carolina style (vinegar based) and a more traditional sweeter style. The sweet sauce was really good and added a lot of flavor. I've had Carolina vinegar BBQ sauces before, but this one literally just tasted like vinegar, nothing else, so we didn't really use it. The fries and coleslaw that came on the side were also good. Try putting some of the slaw on the sandwich. Overall this is a really great brewery with pretty solid food, and definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"3 stars on Yelp is A-OK, and OK just about sums this place up. Their brews are ok, certainly not great, and not oeven one of the better N.E. Ohio micros, but they are saved by the fact that they usually have other solid options on the list (Hello, Columbus Bodhi). The food is passable, especially if you have drunk munchies, but nothing above the level of OK."}
{"text":"I used to work around the corner from here, and we would very often move an afternoon meeting to \"the Kettle!\" Good food, good beer, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent Beer selection.  OK food.

See you go in there, you drink and brew... then eat and drink... then come back 3 to 4 weeks later... drink and bottle... then eat and drink.    Notice the pattern.

It is a lot of fun collecting the ingredients and brewing.  I would recommend 2 people at a minimum to brew and bottle.  It does get crowded.  It comes out cheaper than regular beer, but to start its pricey (buy bottles and whatnot), and you have a lot of beer at once.  You do not need to be a brewmaster to do this.  The staff is very helpful.

The food it pretty good.  I would not recommend anything BBQ.  It is a bland cinnamon type sauce.  Not my style.  The wings are awesome (or should I say the halves of bird,  there large people).  The gumbo is very good also.  

Be sure to try some of the award winning brews too!

Note busy busy place (expanding soon)."}
{"text":"I REALLY love this joint! 

A Little strip mall hides this treasure. 

Come in the back to brew, tend to,or bottle and label your own tasty beer, or the front to stand at the very spacious bar and drink theirs. 

Friends, the bar is where you need to be. 

Fantastic, courteous service..chalk board of about 30 rotating beers on tap, 'bout 40% made in the back room... 

But Wait....don't get ahead of me...\"weak micro brew\" you say...oh no my dear drinking buds... 7.5% spicy winter ale, compare to Great lakes, ( please no haters on this) but as good or better In a pint for $3.50!!!... yes it is true. 

Like the Shitty Shitty Shitty ( did i say fucking shitty?) Buckeye Beer Engine, certain beers are sold in smaller sizes as the ABV (proof) goes up.. 

I hate that shit! ... Charge me more then for Gods sake... DON'T SERVE ME A SNIFTER OF BEER .. alas a lost 1/2 point. 

Table service is good when slow and bad when busy..always competent, just no hustle. ( that's where the other 1/2 point was lost ) 

Stand at the bar. 

Write this down now ... you can thank me later... 

DRY RUBBED SMOKED WINGS. ON TUESDAY ON SALE FOR $3.99 FOR 5 ATTACHED WINGS ( DRUM AND WING LEG STILL JOINED) 

Well...that equals ten wings or $.39 ea. a steal if they were just average! .. but they are so good 

Check this story out: 

I was born and raised in Buffalo, NY...I fricken love wings. 

These are not Buffalo wings...they are gifts from the Poultry Gods to us. 

The Legend: It seems that Robyn the God of poultry appeared to the owner while he was sleeping under a tree on a hill near the Lowe's next door. 

Robyn told gave the owner a book which detailed the secret of how to make NON-BUFFALO wings that everyone would love just as much or better ...and that it was OK to love BOTH the buffalo wings and the new second coming of wings....the Dry Rubbed Smoked Wing! 

Kinda like Poultrigamy... 

Uhh.... then the recipe book kinda vanished... 

but I digress 

Crispy, salty, smoky, herbacous, juicy .... frickin the best... 

Of course everyone knows about Tuesday and the place is packed by 6pm 

Sunday get the entire lineup of the house brew ( ring neck ) for $2.50 a glass... 

Ask to watch people brew...no problem, ask for a sample beer...no problem... Just a totally great place with heart and old-school respect for the customers 

Check it out... You will love it"}
{"text":"The food was pretty bland. There wasn't anything special at all to eat here. I have ordered the wings based on the reviews on Yelp and they were nothing special. The sauce was way too strong that the only thing you could taste was the sauce and not the chicken. The chicken was also marinated in something that had lots of garlic on it which made me remember I ate those for lunch for hours to come. Service was just okay."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Brew Kettle since before craft beer became mainstream. It has always been amazing, and has gotten better over time. The wings and burgers are my standard go-to food choice, but everything else is awesome as well. Top notch beer selections and even their wines are good!"}
{"text":"I loved the ribs and wings here.  The BBQ is top notch, who would have thought Cleveland could do BBQ.  The ipas!   If you love ipas, this place kills it.  Love the brew kettle, the atmosphere and people.  Great place,  visit soon!  Oh and try the wings!"}
{"text":"It was okay. Order did not come out together. I hate eating if everyone doesn't have their food. If you don't eat; yours gets cold. A lose lose situation."}
{"text":"A good variety of food on the menu.  Burger was good.  Nice beer selection.  A fun sports bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"The beer selection is top notch in terms of quality and quantity. This is a GREAT place to go to try a new kind of beer or just get good and bombed with some friends over a loud conversation and a cold pint. To improve matters the bar staff and wait staff are very knowledgeable  in terms of the selection of beers. Occasionally the board or the menu would say something is on tap when it is in fact not on tap any longer so be sure to check that.

Unfortunately the food sucks. None of the food we had was any good. The only glimmer of hope in the food department was buffalo chicken dip. That was pretty decent... we should have just gotten like 4 orders of that instead of any of the entrees.

Go there for the beer but expect to be disappointed by the food. Honestly though the beer is so damn good you probably should be too drunk to notice by the time it comes out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"I love White Rajah, so when we happened to be in the area for Oktoberfest, I was able to enjoy my favorite beer fresh from the source!!  Amazing!  And the food was also a huge bonus...diverse selections and totally tasty stuff!  Our server was really helpful with everything!  Thanks Brew Kettle!!"}
{"text":"Never have I ever though there could be such a big variety of beers in this world. You can also brew your own beer. By the time I left I couldn't walk straight but it was the best experience of drinking beer I ever had. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place has so many good reviews. Maybe if you just go for beer? We were excited to find a place with homemade veggie burgers when passing through, but they were really not good. The fries were blah and I was really disappointed by the fried green beans. We were so excited at the thought of this place and so very let down."}
{"text":"Obviously a great beer selection but very good food. I got the backyard sampler and it was excellent. The portion was big, which I love when ordering BBQ. The 1/4 rib was larger than 1/2 racks I've had elsewhere. It was very flavorful and the meat fell off the bone. Wings were very good and the pulled pork was tender and juicy. But what put it over the top is  the coleslaw. It might be the best I've ever had.  If I lived locally I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Brew Kettle is AMAZING! I stumbled upon this gem many moons ago and I've been hooked ever since. The restaurant is equipped with indoor and outdoor dining, a wine area (where you can taste and make wine), bar, and beer area (where you can brew and bottle your own beer). The food is always tasty regardless of the time of day and/or how crowded the establishment gets. My favorite menu item is the buffalo chicken wrap, but there are plenty of other delicious items to choose from. The restaurant offers different food and drink specials throughout the week, which is awesome and rare these days. The service is always top notch and the staff is very friendly. 

Just a tip... If you plan on checking out Brew Kettle for dinner on the weekend or on a game night get there a little early. The restaurant gets packed pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Good for bar food, great selection of beers. Have tried the pulled pork and the nachos and would go back."}
{"text":"Cool place. I hadn't been here since November of 2010. The place has tripled in size. That's good and that's also bad. One would think more space would mean less of a wait. Not so. We waited for 35 minutes on a Saturday night, after 10pm, for a table. My advice. Eat here during the week or at off peak times. 

Great bar food, excellent beer variety, friendly staff, clean. I had the tri tip sandwich, which was very good."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch so I didn't get to experience the beers, this rating is for food and service only.  First let me say the prices are excellent, and the service was fast.  I opted for a buffalo chicken wrap and some fries. We also split some corn bread at the table.  The Corn Bread was missing something, it may be that I'm use to a denser cornbread than theirs but it just wasn't for me.  The wrap was good, it wasn't sloppy and falling apart which can happen with buffalo sauce and ranch.  I was never wanting for iced tea and the waitress nice, she gave what I thought sounded like honest answers when asked which item she liked more or best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I am definitely coming down with Cleveland Disease. After living here for almost eight years, the most prominent symptom is not wanting to leave my town (Lakewood) when I don't have to. Go all the way to Parma? Sheesh. Anyhow, I'm glad I was goaded by a friend to check out this place in Strongsville, a.k.a. the other side of the planet. 

It's kinda your standard beer-and-burgers place set oddly in a strip mall, but it has a good hook: they make their own excellent beer. Other than Great Lakes Brewing Company, I have been impressed with exactly zero of the places in my town that brew their own beer. This place thankfully changes that -- their pale ale knocked my socks off. And I guess that you can head to the back of the restaurant and get set up with your own bottled pints for way cheaper than you'd pay at a more fancy-ass micro-brew place.

The food and service were fine. I unsurprisingly got the Pig Burger, the one with bacon and a whole bunch of other crap on it. Damn good, although the beer may have swayed my emotions."}
{"text":"This is absolutely a 4 star place, no question. The beer is very good here, or so I'm told by my husband, the only problem was that they were out of the top 2 he wanted to try. Even besides that, there are still plenty of choices and something that is good beer wise, again, so I am told. 

The food is slightly above average bar food I think. It might have been average but after waiting an hour for a table, I was very hungry. I tried the lamb burger which I found to be very good. Maybe a tad over done but with me being pregnant I was ok with that. It tasted kinda like a gyro...but in burger form. My husband got a rack of ribs and those were quite delicious and it was absolutely a whole rack. The best thing I tried here was the cole slaw. It blew my mind. By far the best I have ever had, and it comes with every dish just about! If I had to compare it to something it's kinda of like a mix bw Melt's coleslaw and traditional coleslaw with dill. It was fantastic. 

The service wasn't great, but they were busy with it being the weekend. I guess based on my review it doesn't sound like a 4 star place but it really was pretty decent. I wouldn't try the buff chicken dip as an app tho, below average is a good way to describe it."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since it was up the road and was just a little brew on premise place started by Chris and Pam.  Now it's bought out and added great bbq.  Beers are continuously good and the guest beers are always good.  Still don't understand why they hating on Great Lakes still after all these years.  Once in a great while they will carry one but normally they don't have any on tap.  When I was there the other day they had 3 from the same brewery on.  Guess they are worthy.  

Food is always great.  Smoked wings are awesome and that dill dressing I want dripped all over my body.  

Servers are pretty good depending on who you get.  Bartenders have zero personality from the ones I have encountered.  Come check the place out and if ya get too snookered there is a dumpy motel just across the street.  Crawling distance..."}
{"text":"First time there today.  Went to meet some friends for lunch and have a couple of beers.  Didn't have high expectations for the food.  The food was awesome!  I had the perch tacos with coleslaw and a side of Mac and cheese.  All were some of the best I ever had; great flavor and big portion.  Won't need to eat dinner.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The Brew Kettle has quickly become my family's go-to restaurant out in Strongsville. We're major fans of great pulled pork and this place is the best we've found! My most recent visit I decided to venture off the menu from the usual pulled pork sandwich (5stars) and ordered the quesadillas with pulled pork and loved them. A super unique beer selection to go with any menu items is totally cool, not to mention this place lets anyone brew their own beer in-house! They provide all the recipes/ingredients you could need to make your perfect beer and provides customizable labels. I'm telling you, don't pass up on this place!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Excellent food, great beer selection. We were in town to visit family and wound up coming back several times because we had a great experience the first time and didn't see the point in taking a risk with another place. 

I had the chili, and the pulled pork. Both fantastic. My family enjoyed their burgers and beers. 

Our service was great, and even though the atmosphere is a bit hipster-ish, there's no serious pretension. The staff was friendly, helpful and knowledgable about the menu and beers."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and up until my most recent visit have never made it past their wings and beer. Hands down the best wings I've ever had in my entire life and dry rub is definitely the way to go. 

This time we got the chicken buffalo dip as an appetizer and it was so delicious it made me think I should probably expand my menu options with them. If I wasn't in a public setting I might have licked the bowl clean. 

Service from the bartenders and wait staff have always been great, the hostess on our last visit was very inattentive and I had to remind her that we were waiting for a seat at the bar for a patio spot and that the patio had emptied since we checked in. 

Have also made beer here, extremely fun experience. You do all the fun parts, they handle all the meticulous details. They have recipes you can follow or you can get creative and make your own. Really great way to get into brewing your own beer."}
{"text":"It's nice that this brewery has such an extensive list of beers including their own and from other breweries. The samples are 5 oz and priced individually, some are pricey. 

They have a pretty large menu which includes a lot of bbq so I figured that was their specialty and ordered accordingly. We started with the smoked wings and requested the buttermilk dill dressing on the side. The wings had a great flavor from the dry rub and the dressing was outstanding. 

We then split the triple pig, which you should definitely do because it's 12inches of sub filled with meat and it was hard enough to eat half. It was pork loin, pulled pork, and bacon. I like my bacon slightly underdone and this is how ours came so I loved that. The bread was great as was the bbq sauce on the side. 

Prices and portions are great. 

Service was really slow. The bartender was waiting on us and I think he just had way too much on his plate. We waited a long time to order, but our food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Check out the barbecued spaghetti. It's weird, but you'll be happy for picking it out. Beer selection is obviously fantastic, but try the Meade if they have any available. If you're paleo, the cider choices are limited but quality. The menu is not paleo friendly."}
{"text":"Came here on business travel after seeing all the positive reviews.  Beer selection - 5, food quality - 3, service -0.  Arrived around 8pm on a Wednesday, wings were really good, but the burgers left a lot to be desired.  Despite everyone else basically having their food, server took 10 minutes to arrive and another 10 to deliver our drinks.  After delivering a drink, we had to catch her before running off for another drink for someone else.  Also never came back to see how we were doing with our food."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, their own craft beers are some of the best. I've made beer there and that is a blast. Their smoked wings are to die for. I have always had great service and well everyone is so friendly."}
{"text":"The only reason I can't give this place 5 starts is because the service just wasn't that cool. Like I'm used to a level of customers service and attention when I go to a new brewery. I wanna know what hot what's not.  What's ur favorite beer here. Now it was 1230 on a Friday and possibly kinda early for that time of the day sooooo I'm gonna review this later but the bartender just was not doing it. However...... I had one beer that taste like a pint of kitten piss but I don't believe that was even a brew kettle beer. But their milk stout Had me in amazement. It was so delicious, I got a growler of it and it's gone. It didn't even last 4 hours, and 2 hours of that was driving and going to the store.  But the real game changer is the option to brew ur own beer. After I go through this process which I will be doing next month. I'll add another review."}
{"text":"Anywhere you can get a burger done Rare, you know it is fantastic quality...no need for extra frills (no need for cheese or bacon although, you can add those items if you prefer).  Their burger is plane jane but perfectly cooked.  My favorite burger hands down (and trust, I have been on a mission to find one that beats Brew Kettle's).  Dry rub wings are very good as well."}
{"text":"I can't give more than three stars. For several reasons. To start off, we arrived and were told that we could not be seated at a table because there were only four of us.  Understandable except for one problem.  Five mins later a group of eight got seated four at that table and four at another table. This group walked in after we arrived.  But since the table was meant for six.  They split the group up.  Not acceptable to me. A group was moved ahead of us and was split up even though we could have been seated there like their group of four. 
Onto the food. Tonight I had the portabella sandwich. The sandwich was not bad.  But not great.  The portabella was really small.  The taste was really good though.  I ordered the potato du jour. it was redskin potatoes with pastrami and Swiss cheese.  Don't know where the pastrami was.  But that's ok because it arrived cold.  It was replaced with hot ones.  I won't reorder due to the flavor.  It wasn't for me. I thought it was bland. The cole slaw was really good.  Jennifer our waitress was really nice and was able to joke with us. I hope to have her serve me when I decide to come back."}
{"text":"As an avid brewer and wine-maker, I love to see what's brewing elsewhere. The Brew Kettle never dissapoints! There is always a great selection of house-made brews, and an interesting variety of selections on tap. Beers are always changing, so doing a sampler (six small glasses) is a must. The food is not for the faint of heart - and is graced by the best pulled pork I've had in this town graces an 'Ultimate Mess' \"salad\" and many other pork-delivery methods (topping nachos and spaghetti, in sandwiches, you name it!).  Not many choices for those attempting to eat healthy - but why would you try here?  

 Very crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, but the new large dining area limits the wait we used to suffer before it was added on. We usually try to work in a lunch here rather that squeeze in for dinner, or try to eat at the bar. Servers are mostly nice and knowledgable, though very rushed during busy times. We love this palce - and so will you -  if you focus on the beer and the bbq!"}
{"text":"My family and I celebrated a number of birthdays this past Sunday evening with dinner at the Brew Kettle.  They were able to quickly accommodate our party of nine without a prior call.  We have been coming here for years, and every time, I have left with a very great dining/drinking experience.  They have a vast selection of beer, and more recently they have begun to include their own beers on tap.  

On Sunday nights they have a special on their beers that includes $2.50 pints and $7 pitchers.  Their beers seem to be very hit or miss.  When we attempted to order the special, they were out of all but three beers.  Their IPA was fantastic, but the Belgium wit style beer was disgusting.  We also tried a porter that was sldo very good.

Moving on to food, this is where I have never been disappointed!  I normally order the portabella mushroom sandwich, which is delicious.  I love that you can get any other side for no additional charge.  They also have a potato du jour, which normally is very good.  This visit, I ordered a California fish burrito that was on special.  It had a very tasty cilantro sauce on it.  This fish was a very high quality perch.  Everyone seemed very satisfied with their meals.

The Brew Kettle is a great place to have dinner or to sit at the bar and watch sports while enjoying great food and a wide variety of beer."}
{"text":"Great selection and service, no complaints ...it is what it is ... Nothing more nothing less ... So it gets 5stars for being exactly like expected."}
{"text":"Great beer, good food!  Buffalo chicken salad was very fresh and yummy!  

Not the best TV set up to watch a game is why I opted for 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about these owners!  They treat customers right!  The food is awesome!  And the servers are all polite!-nice change!  The house lager washes down the awesome buffalo wings perfectly!  Keep up the great work!  The Brew Kettle Name is very positive now!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and 30 beer taps, their brews and others from microbreweries all over the country.  Can't go wrong with a combo like that!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town just for the night and it really hit the spot. I had the backyard sampler and my husband had the 6 way chili and jalapeño cornbread. Everything was delicious and plentiful and cheap. Home brew root beer was great too. Overall a great place, wish we came to Cleveland more often!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite neighborhood places to visit. The beer is world class, the self brewing in the back is unique and fun, the food is outstanding, especially the dry rub wings.
But I give it a 4 star because things seem to be rapidly declining there: unfriendly hostess station; dated interior and booths which are too narrow to fit into; a little dirty, in general; cold food delivered to the table; trash and cigarette butts at front door entrance. This place needs a good refurbishing and a little customer service re-training."}
{"text":"This review is for the food only, so stay tuned for the update when I make it back for some beer (you'll be waiting with bated breath, no doubt). I was in the neighborhood for a business meeting, and hoped to steer our lunch party to a good local joint rather than a McChain. The food was very good, and everyone enjoyed their selections, but I just wasn't blown out of the water by the menu. It is solid pub fare at a reasonable price. There are salads, sandwiches, and more substantial entrees to choose from. 

Drinking at a business lunch is rarely a good idea (although I would argue that the European style of tippling with the midday meal would make us all a bit more pleasant) so I was unfortunately not able to sample the star of the Brew Kettle's show. They had an impressive range of house-brewed beers along with some guests (Wyder's Pear Cider comes to mind). They sell 22-oz four-packs to go, as well as growlers.

Service at our lunch was quick and pleasant. I will definitely be back to sample the beers and more food."}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews, checked this restaurant/bar out...  Food was mediocre! Neighborhood BAR would be my definition of this establishment.  A couple small televisions near the bar for sporting events.  Beer bar, try Buffalo Wild Wings 50 yards away, much better food, televisions and establishment in my opinion.  Customer service experience was above average."}
{"text":"Great wings and BBQ spaghetti! Obviously the beers are awesome too. They have many any micro brews from round the country. They had a wine bar next door now too."}
{"text":"Deliciousssssss home brewed IPA's (IPA national champions) & perfectly cooked burger!"}
{"text":"This place was GREAT! As a self proclaimed beer snob I have found my home away from home. I was so disappointed when I found out work was putting us up in Strongville when working in Cleveland. Now after discovering Brew Kettle and Metroparks I can't wait to get back. Gumbo was awesome but it was even better when I dunked my jumbo Jalapeño Cornbread into it. And who needs dessert when you can spread the cinnamon butter on the cornbread. My buddy had enough will power and etiquette to leave a bite of his Pulled Pork Spaghetti, and he to was happy with his decision. We both had a couple of pints, but we knew we needed to do beer flights to cover more ground. Mission accomplished! I'll be back...oh, they also had a lot of cool merch for sale."}
{"text":"Great choice of Beer and food. White Rajah Beer,Wings dry rub and buffalo chicken dip is a must try. Sloppy nachos is also awesome. 
Great ambience and good service by staff too. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great beer selection (about 25 brews on tap) and delicious food (just you're bar standards -- wings, burgers and sandwiches). The atmosphere is friendly and casual. The prices reasonable. The only problem with this bar is it's popularity. The place is always so crowded that it's nearly impossible to get a booth  -- or even a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"Love this place . Try the BBQ spaghetti ! You will get it every time , it's addictive . I've Brewed beer here for years also . Very helpful staff"}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone complains about the food because I love it! My boyfriend always raves about the wings. I don't eat meat so I wouldn't know. But the veggie wrap is amazing. The veggie burger isn't bad for a veggie burger. Or you could get any of the salads without the meat. The beer is great (I laughed when I saw the review about no domestic beers lol.) White Rajah is amazing. Always a favorite. Took a star away because the service is always average. Never get refills and have to wait for checks to get picked up (we had our cards out on the table ready and she walked away) It's not a big deal to me but I know others care about that stuff."}
{"text":"In order to curb my booze bill this summer, I joined my sisters and a couple friends to brew our own beer. Why did they ? Perhaps they were inspired by habitually watching Laverne and Sherley re-runs during childhood. 

The process of making beer in your kettle isn't hard work and usually takes about 2 hours. Note you need to make reservations for your kettle at least 3 months or so in advance ! Total cost can vary on what type of beer you brew, from $120-150 for a kettle [and all of the ingredients] plus a deposit for bottles. Each kettle makes about 72 22oz bottles of your brew [less than $2 a bottle depending on what you brew]. 
Psst...Kettles #6-8 are more prone to boiling over, which is a no-no ! . Another big plus is that you're able to design your bottles' labels with your own name and logo/sketch or an image from their catalog of clip art. 

Before arriving to brew, I recommend to check out their website and see their 20-30+ recipes of different beers of all sorts: IPAs, Ambers, stouts or even simple lagers, or a barley wine. I was a bit overwhelmed when I went and couldn't decide. Unfortunately, they only had about 5 or so of them on tap to sample at the bar but you can buy beers [about 10-20 micros from all over the country, all on a big chalkboard, with their ABVs and IBUS] at the bar and drink as you brew your own. They have the recipes clearly outlined and ingredients there, you just follow the instructions. 

About 3 weeks later, you come back to bottle your beer. It's hassle-free, fun, and the only reason I would venture out to Strongsville."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I visit here frequently and we're never disappointed. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and I can make meals on the appetizers alone! Very tasty :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop and try different beers.  The beer selection is second to none.  It is all original.  The food is very good and very affordable.  This is a beer connoisseur's dream."}
{"text":"Could have been a 5 star.  Staff quality is all over the place.  Was there in the evening and it wasn't busy at all.  Couldn't get seated.  The whole time I'm standing there, a woman who looks like a manager was just sitting there chatting with some guy at a table.  I kept looking directly back at her like \"Hi, can I get seated?\" and she intentionally ignored me.  Other employees walked right past me.  10 minutes later I'm about to leave and 2 hostess girls finally look at me like I'm on drugs and say \"Can we help you?\" .....and I'm like \"Yeah I just want to get a seat.\"  and they are like \"Oh you can just seat yourself\"....to which I replied \"Oh, the sign here said wait to be seated\".....

Anyways.  The waitress was A++ and the food was great.  I guess if you're waiting more than a few minutes to sit, just F'ing seat yourself."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I have never ordered something from here I didn't like. What a unique selection of food!

I have two words for you, barbecued spaghetti. I know, I know it sounds gross. I'm telling you it's a revelation! Pasta with barbecued pulled pork, cheddar cheese, and scallions. What's not to like?

If you're not feeling adventurous enough to try the spaghetti, one of my favorites is the buffalo chicken dip. It is absolutely amazing. Not too spicy for the wimpy taste buds out there but still delicious. It's great for an appetizer, if you're willing to share of course. 

Let's say neither of those appeal to you. First of all, we probably can't be friends. Secondly, I can guarantee you will love the six-way chili. With a base of white cheddar macaroni and cheese, followed by a scoop of Amber ale chili, then topped with cheddar cheese, jalapeños, sour cream, and scallions. Yea I said it. All that deliciousness pilled into one bowl! All of the food is wonderful but those are the must haves. Jalapeño corn bread is also great. I should probably stop before I just list the whole
menu."}
{"text":"Good beer, great service.  I think we had our food in 5 minutes!  And, it didn't suck!  

I had the tri-tip sandwich and my friend had the sampler, and both received rave reviews.

I started with the brew kettle irish stout, which was good, but not \"stout\" enough for me.  

Lots of other food on the menu sounded great, but I have only one stomach."}
{"text":"I love Brew Kettle! My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Sunday after tobogganing at the Chalet in Strongsville (highly recommend!) it was fairly empty and we were able to get a seat right away. 

Brew Kettle has some amazing beers and I've never been disappointed! I love the White Rajah and other IPAs from them. My boyfriend got a pale ale and it was also delicious. 

For lunch, I ordered a brat burger on a pretzel bun with Mac and cheese on the side. The burger was huge and the Mac and cheese was some of the best I've ever had! It was so all so good! The burgers also come with cole slaw on the side. I'm not usually a fan, but Brew Kettle's was actually very good and I ended up eating it all. 

They also have group events where you can brew your own beer, which is really cool! I will definitely be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"This WAS one of my most favorite brew houses to visit. Food is unique and tasty, beer good. That is until last week. Last week I was taking my son - in from Texas and his new girlfriend- out to your establishment.  We ate and drank, had a bill of $77, and went to pay with a $200 gift certificate. An employee approached our table and told us that\" he was sorry he couldn't accept the gift certificate, because the brew kettle had new ownership and didn't honor this anymore!\" ??? It's still the brew kettle! The gift cert is printed on special brew kettle paper. He said he would compromise and give us 25% off!!!! What!?? Honor my gift certificate! He came back to the table and said the meal would be covered, but that was $77 and they still would not give us a the difference of the gift certificate. We were shocked!! Who is this new ownership? ? Bad business decisions to loyal customers is bad business!! Sorry to see them at progressive field! Won't be back!"}
{"text":"We love Brew Kettle! 
The have great meaty dishes and lots of beer options.
But what you might not expect is how very excellent their veggie burger and portobello sandwich is. Both are so substantial. None of this veggie afterthought.
And they have the best slaw anywhere! It's light and peppery.
We especially appreciate their Sunday special - $2.50 for pint of Brew Kettle beers. Hubby can have white rajah (ipa) and I can go with something dark. 
Our boys love it, too. Housemade root beer and ribs are favs for them."}
{"text":"Great burgers and beer. Super casual. Bad: the bus boys spray the tables w
Chemical solution each time they clean a table. Completely ruins the dining experience due to coughing. That's gross. That should only b done after hours. Just use a regular wash cloth for ppl that r currently eating"}
{"text":"To think it can't get worse..it has.. The food is no different than any other chain, corporate, greasy spoon. The \"owner\" is NOT a beer guy and it shows.  He's a bean counter and THAT shows.  Portion sizes and food quality prove it.  Beer is still good, but look elsewhere for food.  Why give money to an owner that just wants to take care of himself and cheap out the customers??"}
{"text":"The food is better than two stars and possibly as good as a high 3 or low 4 stars.  I'm not \"beer guy\" so can't comment on that part of it, which in fairness appears to be well done. 

But.

Time after time after time after time the service is slower than slow and usually indifferent. After a while you just get tired of flagging down servers for a drink refill or a check.  Heck, we've waited 5 minutes for someone to come up front and seat us, and the place was nearly empty! 

What's so very frustrating about this is I've spoken directly toThe Boss about this. He assured me they would work on the issue. Several visits later it's quite obvious they've not worked on it very hard. 

So, here's the deal: You WANT my money? Fine, at least pretend like you want to offer good service, otherwise, there are plenty of other places we can go.  We've made out last visit to Brew Kettle, which is too bad because they do some things very well."}
{"text":"food sucks. beer is okay. I had to send my burger back twice because it was overcooked.  I had asked for medium rare.  first I got well done, then I got medium well.  I ended up only eating the side of fries which are frozen and not good.  Pulled pork was super dry, the side of sauce wasn't helping at all.  I would only recommend for the beer, not food. and expect a long wait for a table if going on a weekend."}
{"text":"This is an awesome brewery/barbeque place in Strongsville! I was skeptical about this place when I first went here, thinking it was a typical bland Strongsville restaurant, I was totally wrong! They have an extensive awesome beer list! My favorites are the Summer solstice and the...i forgot the name but it begins with Heffer! It's super refreshing with a slight after taste of banana (don't be skeptical I know it sounds odd). What really made me a fan of The Brew Kettle was the food!

Smoke House Wings- These smoked wings are delicious and a great appetizer to split with a small group! The BBQ and dry rub are the best!

Ultimate Mess Pulled Pork Salad- I don't even know where to start, this may be one of my most favorite meals I've ever had! It is a Caesar salad with croutons and homemade Caesar dressing. If that isn't enough they pile on a ton of juicy pulled pork, and then they pile a bunch of coleslaw on top of that! It sounds interesting but believe me it's delicious I recommend it to anybody who likes salad and pulled pork! Such a unique amazing combination!"}
{"text":"Awesome ribs!!!  Best I have had in a long time!  Not to mention their Zombie Killer is amazing as well as the pear ciser!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice of beers.  Highly recommend the \"White Rajah\".  Food is fantastic and the service is equally impressive.  Wings with \"White Rajah are a perfect combination.  Thanks to Manager Mindy for being so kind to an Aviation Buff.   Next time I'm in the Cleveland area, I will be back."}
{"text":"The best wings I have ever had. They also have a great sandwich called the triple pig. I've had a few of their beer offerings and they have all been great with the Belgian White Rajah being the stand out beer. Will definitely be heading back."}
{"text":"Drawn to this place since I'm a microbrew fan. Outside is deceiving since it looks like a package store in a strip mall. Once inside the space is large, lot of good vibe, and decorated with great brewery memorabilia. 
Beer selection is good between what they brew in house and other selections. I went with White Rahja - a well balanced IPA not too hoppy. 
The menu has a good selection of standard pub fare but also some unique stuff - bbq spaghetti, grilled burrito, perch tacos. 
They are also known for bbq. Guy next to me had sampler so I went for it too. Started with salad - house made Dijon vinaigrette was good. Sampler had bbq wings, spare ribs and pulled pork. All were good - wings especially with dry rub and sauce, great flavor. Ribs were good, not great. I want my bbq to fall off the bone. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Not sure why I would return?  It is slow here, 3 other groups at bar, but obliviois bartenders have backs to bar ignoring customers.. empty glasses yet everyone needs to sit w empty glass ans wait for a personality-less bartender to serve them. Also they seat kids right next to the bar vs the restaurant area.. so if youre looking to escape screaming crying kids.. this is the wrong place for you. Way too many places to stop for a good beer and mediocre food.. avoid"}
{"text":"If you are a beer snob, this place should be at the top of your list for places to visit. Their in-house beers are top notch, with a style to please any palate. Their food is also incredible, with quite possibly the best wings in the area. Order them with dry rub and be prepared to clean your hands between each one. The meat just falls off the bone. Their BBQ selections are also fantastic. For beer, I recommend the White Rajah if you are a fan of a good, hoppy IPA. Dark Helmet is another favorite of mine. Also, if you have never brewed your own beer, you can do so in the back of the store. They provide literally everything, bottles and labels included!"}
{"text":"My first time here. We came for lunch, so no beer as we were working, but if it's brew you want, this would be the place to come.

I had the Brew kettle burger, a half pounder with cheese. It tasted like it was cooked over a charcoal grill. It was perfectly cooked and flavorful. It came with fries that were good, and Cole slaw (I hate Cole slaw).

The place was bright and clean. The service was good. The only issue was a strong bleach smell throughout the restaurant. I'm not sure if that should make me feel good because it's clean, or worry what they had to clean up that required so much bleach. Regardless, I would go back. I think the burger with sides ran about $9, which was worth it for the half pound burger."}
{"text":"This is a great place!
Great beer selection....some of the best wings I have EVER experienced...GREAT, GREAT, GREAT SERVICE!

I enjoyed watching the brewing process in back too.

This is a great place - go on Tuesday to get the wing deal - you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pub restaurant. The food is very unique and a good value. Try the BBQ spaghetti for a treat."}
{"text":"Scheduled a brewing and brought the whole family to Brew Beer for my Dad's 60th birthday. The kegs are against the wall and they have tables in the middle between the kegs and bottle deposits. The service is laid back and really friendly. Everyone is willing to help out. 

The experience itself is amazing. Seeing my dad actually enjoy something and was motivated to do it was awesome on its own. The brewing process takes some time but it goes by fast when you have some brews and food. We got two orders of the wings dry rubbed with a terayki and a hot sauce on the side. These were the best wings I've ever had in my life. They were amazingly delicious. They were actual wings!!

On Sundays they have half off brew kettle drafts so we were drinking pints for $2.50.. it was awesome. We go back this Saturday to bottle our beer. I'm so excited and I know my dad is too. Will post pictures after this weekend :)"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! I love the option to taste test a variety of beers, hard ciders, and wine. You can even brew your own beer! There is something for everyone. Perfect spot for date night or meeting up with friends."}
{"text":"Service was fast at first then began to dwindle by the end of our meal.

Although the food was out quickly, it wasn't prepared with utmost care.  I ordered the lamb burger and found it was over cooked and quite dry."}
{"text":"We have been meaning to try this place based on the reviews and it was awesome.  We went Sunday and they had a $7 pitcher special for Brew Kettle beers. We had a pitcher of the solstice wit and it was really good. For dinner I had the ultimate pulled pork salad and  it was huge. The food came out fast and the waitress was great."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great customer service! We ordered the popular smokehouse wings traditionally made with dry rub with a side of the dill ranch dressing, 6-way chili (not my favorite sauce but was still yummy) , jalapeño corn bread, and the pulled pork salad. All of which were phenomenal! Also, had the hand crafted root beer (amazing).. my husband ordered flights of beers (white rajah IPA and cucumber dill being the best)..also impressive.. Waitress was super sweet and attentive! All round great experience here in Ohio!"}
{"text":"Been back a few times since they have expanded and service seems to be much, much better.  They really outgrew themselves and the additional area was much overdue.  They have another dining area outside of the original dining room/bar which is nice for waiting.  They have daily lunch specials that are reasonable deals (except on Friday).  They have good options for kids, and it's pretty good.  Mini corn dogs are delish!  Most of the tables are booths, so it's pretty comfy for anyone.  The soups are hearty and bison burgers are delicious.  

Glad to have had some more good experiences here.  Never had a food item that I didn't enjoy here, however the menu is a little bland.  The pulled pork is probably one of their specialties.  

Warning: Upon arrival of the soft pretzel app, the mustard sauce is mainly composed of wasabi.  Look out."}
{"text":"Great pumpkin beer and you cannot go wrong with the pretzels, chili or nachos! It's fun to sit at the bar, great bartenders!"}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection! The Brew Kettles' (TBK) own brews and many guest beers. Love TBK pumpkin and bourbon barrel aged beers (Dark Helmet - let the Schwartz be with you!) - great place to sample many different beers. Service was really good, waitress even cleared sample glasses frequently.  Hubby enjoyed the food as well, said taco salad was tasty (looked like some good nachos with lettuce added to be 'healthy').  Open late!"}
{"text":"I love this place, and I'm glad I only live 10 minutes away. 

Try the BBQ spaghetti - it's always a winner.  A friend who used to work there said the pulled pork is best (read: freshest?) starting on Thursdays. The pulled pork nachos are good too, and really any of their BBQ hasn't disappointed me or the friends I've taken.

The beer selection is ever-changing and never disappoints (unless you wanted a Miller Lite).

Service is average."}
{"text":"I had the BBQ spaghetti with cole slaw as a side. First of all for $11 I think it is a real value. The serving size was large and comes with bbq pulled pork with pasta covered by melted cheese. I thought it was very tasty and the cole slaw which was also good acted as a good palate cleanser. I realize that this place also has a large beer selection and mine was good but I am much more interested in the food than I am in the drink. I was in town on business and probably won't be able to eat here again. If I did live here, I would. I would also like to test other menu items as it is possible that this could be a 4 star restaurant.

I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Congrats Brew Kettle.  You got that 1 last star out of me.  You can thank the beer.  Everything related to the beer.  The selection.  Their brews. You can actually brew your own beer onsite and bottle it yourself.  Amazing.  White Rajah.  There's a reason it wins awards.  It's even better at the tap.

So everything is hunky dory right?  Wellllllll this place tries to do more than beer, and while it tries, I can't say it knocks it out of the park.  The staff is generally friendly.  The location is what it is.  It's a strip mall, and as such, the interior and exterior remind you of that.  There's nothing memorable like Great Lakes or Platform, or Mad Tree or Rheingeist.  I hear they are working on a new location, but haven't seen developments.  What about the food?  It's fine.  It's not quite good enough to be excited about or different enough to tell people about.  Meatloaf, subpar.  Pulled pork, disappointing.

But that beer..."}
{"text":"Best brewpub I have been to in Ohio. Awesome beers and food. They have excellent BBQ. Some of my favorites are the BBQ spaghetti and their wings."}
{"text":"I am very eager to return down to The Brew Kettle. They are undergoing renovations right now that will possibly triple the dining space. They really needed to do this a while ago because it is extremely tight in there. I have been there twice now. First time, I was probably pretty jacked up because I don't know what I ordered. This time, I had the Buffalo Chicken Salad. It was terrific! I had the soup of the day which was a blue cheese potato and kielbasa soup. The soup menu had a reference to Dumb and Dumber about the Soup Du Jour, I was laughing about it. It was really damn good soup of the day. I tried my friends soup, that too was good. My friend and his woman enjoyed the Pulled Pork sandwich. I really think the beer list rivals Beer Engine. This is a must go to location if you are into drinking good beer. This place could also put me in the poor house."}
{"text":"White Rajah is the BEST beer. And it's brewed here! The Brew Kettle is such an awesome place. Firstly, you can brew your own beer! I did it with my department at worked as a \"team building\" activity, and it was great. The staff is super helpful, so you never feel lost, and the beer was phenomenal. We had opted to do a type of Christmas ale. Delicious. 

Make sure you order the wings... they are smoked, they fall off the bone, and they are amazing. You can't go wrong with any of the bbq options, and their coleslaw is truly unique. I've never had a coleslaw like it, and I love it. I usually order a double order of it.... it's an addition. I also have really enjoyed their flat breads and burgers. But nothing beats the White Rajah beer."}
{"text":"We LOVED the wings, and were Tuesday regulars. Beware, new menus and much higher prices. The 5.99 wing special is now 9.99!! Quite a jump!!!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go grab a beer and some food or take it a step further and make your own beer. We showed up at at 5:30 to make some brew and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience. The staff was friendly, educated, and helpful throughout the entire process. We started with a recipe we chose and followed all the directions throughout the process. While we waited in between steps we enjoyed beer from the bar and food from the kitchen. The food was exceptional and the beer, which was one of their in house brews, was one of the best IPA's I have ever had. In a few weeks we will go back to compete the bottling process, try our beer, and take it home with us. The cost is well worth what you get out of it and it is really not that expensive. For what we brewed cost us $130 and we will get around 75, 20ounce beer bottles out of it."}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich held plenty of meat, but it wasn't flavorful or succulent. The Cole slaw had nice notes and I liked the pickles. Mac n cheese was very thick and a little \"gaggy.\" I tasted the chicken my husband ordered and thought it was the best thing I'd tried at lunch at this restaurant."}
{"text":"A nice Sunday lunch with good brews and great food. Came during Cleveland beer week and they had some special barrel aged reserves on tap as well as a collaboration with Willoughby Brewing. All were beyond fantastic. 

We started with the Smokehouse Wings with the original dry rub. The flavor was out of this world and the meat fell off the bones. The Sausage and Beer Gumbo was packed full of flavor and very hearty. Finally, I had the Andouille Mac & Cheese. It was very creamy and the sausage was cooked nicely. 

Overall, the meal was delicious and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We have brewed several (or more ...) batches of beer in their brewery.  We have also spent some time at the bar and even more at the restaurant.  We have a good sample of their offerings and service.

Unfortunately -- for the patrons -- there are new owners.  The first thing they did was raise prices.  A beer we used to brew was moved from one price to another column -- $10 more (plus a ton of taxes in Cuyahoga County - sad) .  They also raised all prices.  The crates which used to cost $7 are now $15.  They also raised the prices significantly on empty bottles.  So, folks, the deals are over -- at least for brew-it-yourself-ers.  

The restaurant/bar still has good food and the portions are large.  (Actually, waaay to large and waaay to expensive for a lunch -- unless you are a fat boy or a hog.)  

So, if I were to have rated this place last summer or prior, I'd have given 'em a solid 4 or 5 -- likely the latter.  But, because the new owners are messin' with their customers (and employees also, I hear), they get a 3!

The new owners may be killing the golden goose."}
{"text":"I am not going to lie but I come here for the White Rajah which is arguably my favorite Ohio beer around.  The service here ie always good but the food is not always the best but I am normal three sheets to the wind off white Rajah by the time it arrives so it tastes good to intoxicated me."}
{"text":"First off - one of the best servers we've had in a long time. But of course I lost the check with her name on it. Friendly, was able to answer questions about the food and came back to check on us! order a burger - cooked how we wanted. Also ordered perch - very good. Only con was it could have been cleaner. We would come back for the food and service."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Saturday night.  Wait was about 30 minutes or so.  Ogrefest was going on (high alcohol beers on tap) so I was surprised it wasn't busier.  

This place is nestled in a strip in front of Wal Mart and Home Depot.  Parking is limited.  When I waited in line to put my name in for a table the girl at the front was pretty rude.  Not nice.  Just rude.

I made my way to the bar to get a beer while I waited.  I asked if I could get a taste of the Thirsty Dog Barrel Aged Bananas Foster Imperial Stout.  I was told no.  Because it was an expensive Ogrefest beer so they weren't doing tastes of it.  I told him that's why I wanted just a taste.  I didn't want to pay $8 for a glass of beer I didn't like.  He said sorry, but he liked it.  Well that's nice.  I'm glad you like it.  I ordered one and forced it down anyways.

We were seated in a booth a few places from the main door.  My wife asked the server if she could order a glass of wine from wine side of the restaurant.  They have a make your own wine area.  The server acted like she was asked to go to Wal Mart to get her a glass of wine.  Reluctantly, she said she would do it.  I mean, it was maybe 20 feet from our table.  The opposite bar was probably farther away!

I ordered a cup of gumbo soup and barbecue spaghetti.  The gumbo was filled with fresh meat and vegetables.  It was pretty good.  Has a bit of spice to it.  The barbecue spaghetti has spaghetti mixed with barbecue sauce and pulled pork with shredded cheddar and scallions on top.  Spaghetti was cooked al dente.  The porks was tender and smoky.  Very good mixed in with the spaghetti and sauce.  The sauce was very watery.  Like they didn't do a good enough job of draining the noodles before adding it to the sauce.

I will also echo other reviews that have noted a huge decline in the service and quality of both the food and beer once ownership changed hands.  Sad to see such a great place going downhill.  We used to eat here every month.  Now we barely make it here once a year any more."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is very energetic and just a very fun place to come hang out with friends and have a beer. I did not eat here since I only ran up to grab two beers, I always passed this place because the outside just looked too plain, but I'm very glad I stopped in, I'll definitely be back to eat and drink more beers. The workers are very educated on the beers and pricing and the beer was tasty. I'm really impressed with this place and will love to come back."}
{"text":"Been here about 100 times and finally writing a review. The beer here is awesome, from their house brews to their rotating taps. If you like iPad be sure to try the white rajah and the el lupalo libre, both are too notch. I'd like to see a better stout from them, but the Kitka milk stout makes an on dessert beer, be forewarned it is very sweet.

The food here is great also. The nachos topped with pulled pork or smoked chicken are a meal on their own, or good to share with a group as an appetizer. My other go to appetizer is the fried green beers. They are listed as a side, but you can order as an appetizer and the portion size is huge and you will not be disappointed. If you're looking for lighter fair, get the smoked chicken salad. If you're just pretending to eat healthy get the ultimate mess pulled pork salad...it's a salad, but is topped with a 1/2 pound or so of pulled pork. As far as the dinners go I always go to the triple pig sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich is amazing and comes with great cole slaw and 2 different barbecue sauces. Put the slaw on the sandwich...it's divine. This sandwich will last you 2 meals. The smoked wings here are the best in Cleveland. Get the cajun dry rub and a sauce on the side of you prefer. 

Brewing beer here is also a great experience.

This is the ideal brew pub. I've been all over (Great Lakes, platform, founders, bells, new holland...to name a few) and nothing compares. The brew kettle has the perfect combination of great food, great beer, and great brew pub feel.....the only thing I would like to see is some bigger tv's to watch a game there."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  I don't eat red meat and the menu caters to those who do.  Still, I was able to work around that and had a really good meal that included 

- a large serving of smokehouse wings in the original dry rub (outstanding)

- house salad (very good)

- seasoned rice (on the spicy side and very good)

- broccoli (plain, steamed - just ok but a great healthy choice)

- cole slaw (very good)

All dishes were very inexpensive and I liked that the sides were small enough to be for one person... so you can order as much as you like.

The beer selection is amazing including beers on tap.  I had just returned from Dublin, Ireland where I enjoyed a week of nightly pub visits... so I was maxed out on beer by the time I got here.  I won't hesitate to return and try something on tap."}
{"text":"Great concept for a brewpub. But, this place is so unorganized that it just chaos. And the amount of fruit flies buzzing around. Didn't notice until it was too late and I had to actually walk out without finishing my meal. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and would come back for sure.
Fish tacos were delicious, pork salad was very good and original and if you eat the tripple pig you better have an appetite and was delicious."}
{"text":"MUST TRY!!! You'll find me here. Great Food, Great Beers, Great Atmosphere! Love it!!!!

For Food: They're known for they're BBQ. Pulled Pork is a special and really good. 
Fish n Chips is a big meal. The fish is lightly battered and they're BIG!! The home cut fries are some of the best. They have the skins on them and i could eat them for days. An alternative would be the sweet potato fries which are fantastic as well. The Buffalo chicken dip is right out of Super Bowl Sunday. It's a great appetizer.
If you like pork!- then the Wisconsin sandwich is for you. brat, sauerkraut, mustard on a sandwich = Deliciousness!!

Negatives: the salads are not that great. The wings are nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"It had been years since I dined at the Brew Kettle in Strongsville, and I was excited to see how much it had changed since my last visit. 

I was extremely impressed by the remodeled interior and the food did not disappoint. 

I ordered a 5 glass sampler off of their extensive beer, and really enjoyed being able to taste different flavors. 

In regards to food, I ordered the steak salad and spicy BBQ smoked wings. Both of which were DELICIOUS. 

Our server was attentive and well informed, as well. 

My only reason for a deduction was the overall cost of the bill, which was close to $50 before tip. Some of the beers are extremely expensive, but I also know that these are craft brews so I get it. Nonetheless, a bit too pricey."}
{"text":"I'm a quite a bit tougher in my criticism when it comes to microbreweries, because they're the best places on earth. The Brew Kettle is really good, not great. I'll start off with the bad and bring it home with the good.
     First, it's located in a plaza. I'm a sucker for free standing buildings with well coordinated aesthetic architecture. It's hard to notice this place even if you're looking for it. In you're periphery it might as well be a hair salon. 
Secondly, the brewery's original beers even though they are made in different styles (ie. IPA, Brown Ale, Amber Ale, Pale Ale, etc...), all feel like English brown ales and lack carbonation. The rice in the gumbo was a little undercooked as well.
       Other than those few things the place was awesome. The beers although flat-ish were tasty, unique, and fresh. Our waitress was engaging and friendly. I talked to her about beer for over a minute when ordering. She knew her stuff and loved beer as much as I do. She also never let my beer get below a quarter before bringing me a new one. Although the rice in the gumbo was undercooked the rest of it was meaty and spicy with a ton of fresh vegetables packed into it. I had the smokehouse wings for the main course. The original was sweet and spicy.
       Overall a 4 on substance and a 2.5 on aesthetics and location. I bumped the average up .5 stars considering how I drunk I am whilst writing this review. 4 stars!"}
