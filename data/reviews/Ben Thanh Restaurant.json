{"text":"I know all the spots in the town for Vietnamese noodle soup, this one makes the top list for me, The place is clean and friendly servers. The soup is done just right not too salty and the portions are good as well. I'll be definitely coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Ben Thanh has long been a favorite. Their relocation to Windsor Square jus off Independence Blvd is in a larger, nicer space that's very accessible to South Charlotte. The food quality remains the same - very good - and service seems to be even better.  There is a very nice bar and they should have their license to sell wine, beer and sake' next week.  Ad added plus is a large room suitable for large groups.  It's still very affordable too!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Asian food, wait staff is friendly, helpful and attentive. The menu is lengthy with options for every taste. I start every meal there with the Summer Rolls and end it with the avocado shake. If you have never had Vietnamese, you have to try it. The Vietnamese Pancake is one of my favorites. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"YES!  This should be everyones go-to spot for pho!  It's authentic (none of that adding other vegetables and crap to an already good bowl of soup), good meat, and priced perfectly!  Do yourself a favor and eat some pho from here.  This is what it's about."}
{"text":"Authentic soups- yummy! My family experiments with the menu and we've never purchased a dish we didn't like. The ingredients are fresh and the service is ok. Give it a try--"}
{"text":"Arguably the best pho. The broth is full of flavor. I don't care for a broth that's got too much of an anise flavor, so their broth is just about perfect for me. We have been going here for years. The service overall is great and the new location, although farther, is way better than Central Ave.   Things we love besides the pho: summer rolls and the appetizers where you roll them yourself, hu tieu, vermicelli dishes, Vietnamese hot and sour soup, and bo nhung dam which is beef dipped in vinegar hot pot, gotta get the stinky brown sauce though :)."}
{"text":"Super service, a lot of food choices, and the meal was outstanding. Enough different choices to hit most people's taste buds."}
{"text":"The Bun Thiht Nuoung (spelling?) is amazing here. It's so fresh! The pork is pure meat, not the usual 70% fat 30% pork that most Vietnamese restaurants serve. I'll definitely come here again! Service was quick. Clean facilities."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pho places in the Charlotte area. They relocated here which I find a little better than their old location. But the food is great. Boyfriend and I always get the pho. I tried the Vermicelli bowl for the first time recently and it wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"I have to write about the great experience we had celebrating my boyfriend's 50th birthday at Ben Thanh. And give special thanks to Mai and her brother Cuong for reserving for us space in their separate dining area for the dinner party and providing us with amazing service and excellent food. Our guests had a wonderful time. Almost no one other than us had eaten Vietnamese food before. I lived in southern CA before and ate Vietnamese food there a lot so I know that the food at Ben Thanh was really good when it came out! Good quality, great taste, authentic, great presentation. Because no one knew what or how to order, Cuong knew their menu inside and out and could advise on any questions and recommend which menu #s to order from. It was brilliant to watch. Then we ordered appetizers for the table and they came out very quickly and well presented for the quantity we ordered. Same with the entrees everyone ordered. And drinks. It was a really pleasant evening and positive experience for our guests. And we had a nice time celebrating a milestone birthday."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this authentic Vietnamese restaurant for years. Everything is the way it should be, from the fried rolls to the pho. My sister gets the curry, and I get either pho bo kho (Vietnamese beef stew.. Not on the menu but it's the only place in town that does it right!), or a noodle entree.  Just visited the new Matthews location for the first time. I really like it. The chandelier when you walk in is gorgeous! I kind of preferred the old locations vibe better but eh, what can I say. I like moderately lit places (it's brighter at the new one).   Keep up the great work guys!  I'll follow this place around no matter where their location takes them, haha!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly service. I recommend their lemongrass beef."}
{"text":"The food was great. I love it but I'm giving it a two because customer service sucks. The waitress was rushing us to order our food. Didn't even asked us what we wanted to drink. She just came with water in her hands. We were not even done eating and she brings the check and hand it to my husband. Not even 5 minutes later she comes and pick up the check and insisted my husband to give her money to pay for our food. Mind you we're not even done eating and she was wanting us to pay already. The owner was walking around but didn't even say hi or smile or nothing. I don't feel so welcome here so I won't be back. Certain people don't understand that you run a business here so therefore customer service should be your first priority. You should always make ur customers feel welcome just like how you would make your guest at home feel welcome."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in charlotte I come here all the time and go other places but nothing matches this place. Glad they moved from there old location on central so much closer to me. Get the pho you will like it!!"}
{"text":"Brilliant hu tieu & pho. Happy they've moved locations to nearer my area! Nice atmosphere and seating without feeling cramped, service is good, and the menu is all it needs to be."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere was really nice. Food authentic with good portions. Great value, highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ben Thanh is the way to go if you wanna have authentic Vietnamese food in Charlotte. Get their fresh rolls that you can roll them yourself. They are just a little  pricey but they are sure damn worth it!"}
{"text":"Restaurant had a beautiful atmosphere but  I went solely for the pho. It was very disappointing that they didn't offer chicken pho in chicken broth. They only offered in beef or pork broth. The broth wasn't really that flavorful and the chicken wasn't all that great. I would recommend Vietnam Grille if your looking for amazing pho!"}
{"text":"Found my Pho Heaven! Thankful for the wonderful service and atmosphere! The Pho here is fantastic! I'm glad I continued my journey looking for PHo in Matthews because it stops here! A new local family favorite. I got the Shrimp Pho, the shrimp were plentiful and jumbo, the pork broth was smooth and savory, and the noodles were cooked to perfection. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The staff are always the same & they are always perfect. The food is consistently wonderful. No place in town can itch that clean, balanced amazing flavor. The imperial rolls / fried spring rolls will make you roll your eyes at any other attempt at a spring roll. Their fresh summer rolls are pockets of delicious sunshine."}
{"text":"Really dirty place with below average service.  Literally my server sat me at a table with the centerpiece fallen over and the salt and pepper shakers knocked over on their side next to it.  Even seeing that she just put the menus on the table and didn't even try to pick it up.  The bench had rice and meat on it from the prior guest which I had to get someone to clean up, she said it must have been from the children in the morning.  It was 6pm so that's sad.  Once you get over that the food was good, my pho was actually really good and wife's lemongrass curry was low on flavor but adding soy and spice brought it up to par.  Food is a 3.5, rest is a 1."}

{"text":"I am vegan and also highly sensitive to MSG. There were many options to choose from that were meatless and non-dairy and I asked specifically if they used MSG. The waiter said, \"We can\" and I said,\"No no MSG.\" The food was delicious but within minutes of finishing, I was having an allergic reaction to the MSG.  I was excited thinking I had found a good place to get vegan dishes, but the MSG kills that possibility."}
{"text":"This place is okkkk. Not satisfied. So Im pretty sure that place was the same restaurant on central ave, just relocated. Nothing new. Curry was plain looking and unappetizing. It comes with your choice of rice, noodles, or bread. My pet peeve is people who don't separate chicken when putting it into soup. This way, the chicken all stick together like a blob! Its lazy work! What am I supposed to do? Stick this whole blob in my mouth? This dish was $12 and definitely not worth it. Overpriced. When we were done, our waitress brought us our check. Another waitress decided it was ok for her to take it without saying anything. Never asked us if we want cash back. She walked by twice just looking at us but we didnt leave. 5min later, she laid our check back on the table without a word and walked off. OK, short hair lady, you weren't our waitress so dont act like we owe you. Another thing i hate, people who only know how to pick up the check. This is why they never had business at their old place. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I've been to the Old Ben Thanh many times before, it's been a while since I revisited there, but I decided while I was in the area I would visit their new restaurant since I heard their new place was 10xs better and it was! The restaurant is so much nicer, and very spacious and clean. I ordered the vegetarian hot pot, SO GOOD. I'm a sucker for hot pot and this surely hit the spot. I also love love how nicely all their meals are presented. Definitely authentic Vietnamese food, surely be back soon! (:"}
{"text":"Great Photos.  Awesome lemongrass curry.  The Bo Buying Vi is not to be missed.  One of my favorite places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This restaurant is next to Cici's in Matthews. It was original on Central Ave. The prices have changed to $1 more but the food I believe is still great.  It was cold so pho soup time & that is all we order. $10 for one size large with all the meats. The broth is always great, wish it was hotter since the raw steak did not cook well, it was medium rare still after 10-15m in the soup. I had to throw it out, yuck. Lots of noodles in the broth with beef tendon & shank, 2 meat balls & thin steaks. Um not enough meat but lots of noodles. This made the pho plain I guess they are servicing different people here in Matthews since I realize there was no pork or tripe in the soup... hmmm. For the pho only 3 .  I may drive back 30 minutes out for stir fried rice noodles. I hope they still make great plate!"}
{"text":"First time here at Ben Thanh. I had the steak Pho. It was delicious and a HUGE serving of it too. I brought some home for the next day. My husband had #40 which looked like Pho without the soup. He enjoyed it as well. I haven't tried Vietnamese before so I have nothing to compare it to but it was really good. And nothing beat that super strong Vietnamese coffee I got after dinner!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place whenever I have cravings for good Vietnamese vermicelli bowl with grilled chicken.  Comfort food but on the healthier side. Their summer rolls are just so good!!  Definitely recommend this place whenever you want something really good!"}
{"text":"Was a patron in the former location. Still the flavors that enticed us way back in the 90s. Fresh, hot, delicious. Best summer rolls and yellow pancakes ever."}
{"text":"If you went to the old Ben Thanh, erase that from your memory completely before you think of this one. It is wayyyyyy nicer inside. And even if the quality is the same, I feel like it's better in the new location just b/c it's nicer.   We've been twice now and both times the service was great & the food was even better. My old standby - the summer rolls - are delicious. Bad news for Thai Taste because that was my old go-to spot when I had a craving.   We've tried the Pho Bo Vien (noodle and beef meatball pho), Bun tom Thit  Nuong Cha Gio (pork, shrimp, noodles, lettuce, cucumber, mint), Com Dac Biet, Bun Xao Thap Cam (Noodles with shrimp, beef, chicken and veggies). Definitely go by the pictures on Yelp and order by number!  Glad the new location is so close to home, I will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"My friend, Deanna, and I headed out today for Vietnamese food.  We were in Matthews and needed a place close by.  Had been hearing about this restaurant  and wanted to give it a try. Deanna had never had Vietnamese food, so this was an adventure for her.  I talked her into having the PHO.  As a first time experience, how could she not have Pho?  It was NOT my first experience with Vietnamese, but the cold rainy day just insisted on PHO for me too.  They offered it in beef, pork, or veggie broth.  We both chose the veggie broth with chicken added. It was plenty of food and it was tasty.   Next time I look forward to trying their lemongrass chicken.  Their menu was expansive and I found a few things that made me salivate!   The atmosphere  was a throwback to the sixties or seventies, and I loved it.  The adequate booth space and roomy dining area were a nice change from the ordinary.   The very quiet space was conducive to both conversation and digestion!  Service was spot on. I will be back and will share the good word about this restaurant."}
{"text":"The Pho was excellent.   Very clean place and the service is prompt and friendly. Just traveling through the area and I'm glad we found this place.  Good job!"}
{"text":"This is 3rd time we've been...got the pancake...i had to put my glasses on, there is essentially no filling in these, disgraceful to charge money for this"}
{"text":"The Pho is wonderful, the assemble it yourself spring roll appetizer is wonderful, the lemongrass curry dishes are great.  My favorite Vietnamese place in the CLT."}
{"text":"I adore this little spot. They have some amazing pho, spring shrimp rolls, and a bar that serves sake. Make sure to eat the rolls with the peanut sauce! Efficient and mindful servers."}
{"text":"Great food and good service, they used to be located on Central Avenue they need to advertise that they are in Matthews the food is very good and the restaurant is immaculate. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese food outside Vietnam!"}
{"text":"It's new. Got a late bite to eat. Egg rolls and summer rolls are good. Got the pork and shrimp viet style vermicelli and portions are small. I'm am happy that there is a viet spot in Matthews off 74. I'll be back to try the pho.   More like 2.5 stars bc portions are small but I'll be back and come here 4x per year to Matthews"}
{"text":"I love this place. I ate here back in '08 and have been coming back ever since. Their tofu is the best in the city, bar none."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant recently with my family as we've just moved to the area and wanted some good Vietnamese food. The food is good and authentic, but the reason why I gave them 3 stars is because I feel like they are overpriced. I ordered just a small portion of plain fried noodles for my son (not on the menu) and they tried to charge me full price $12.95 for literally noodles in sesame oil. When I questioned them they said they made a mistake and brought me back my adjusted bill charging $9.95 for the noodles. Needless to say we will not be ordering those again as I feel like they were trying to take advantage of us. I did order a boba tea as well and asked for not blended and was brought a blended drink.  I decided not to complain, but it also tasted average. Our other food items were pretty good except our pork was very fatty and the eggrolls were overpriced as well as most of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"Very good. We had Pho that was very flavorful.  The restaurant was super clean and the food came out fast! Many interesting dishes were served  around us that we want to try next time.        The water was wet."}
{"text":"Vietnamese food in Charlotte is plentiful but not always amazing. But Ben Thanh is one of those go to places. Service is QUICK! Food is delicious and fresh and authentic! I recommended their Hi Tieu noodles for anyone wanting a mean and the Pho here is pretty awesome as well!"}
{"text":"I only give 4 stars instead of 5 due to the value. We order the Bun Tom and it is delicious! Problem is, you don't get your money's worth. You get a very small portion of pork with the $13 bowl of noodles."}
{"text":"Went here a few time. The pho and summer rolls are the only items on the menu worth eating thus far. I tried other items but I felt it was not worth the money as the portions are very small compared to the amount of food you get with a bowl of pho. Stick with the pho noodles and you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"This is probably is best pho place around Charlotte. We love the broth. Our family has been eating here since they were on central!"}
{"text":"Finally reached a point where I'm giving up on what I thought was going to be my go-to pho spot. I've eaten in once and ordered takeout probably 6 times and for some reason there's always an issue.  I've ordered the same thing every time: 2 orders of pho ga (chicken pho). Pretty straightforward, no special requests, no apps, etc.  Every time when I get there to pick it up, they only have one order prepared. Waiting for the second order to be wrapped up wouldn't be such a big deal if it didn't happen EVERY SINGLE TIME.  Tonight, they finally got the order right (encouraging!) but then I got home, unpacked the food and couldn't have been more let down.  The $21.00 pho dinner consisted of cold broth that had actually separated (greasy fat film on top). The chicken? Well, the chicken was awful. Hard, clumped together & ALSO cold. The bag of stir-in extras was gross too. Old, mushy limes & limp veggies. The one bright spot? The jalapeño was pretty fresh. I gave them 2 stars because they're very nice people who are always polite. I really hope they'll make some efforts to improve on the food. For now, I'm looking for a new pho spot."}
{"text":"They recently relocated to this new address. Review their restaurant at their previous location and you can see how good they are. With that being said, the new location is much larger with plenty of space. Not only that but it's in the Matthews area and there's not really any pho restaurants unless you travel down independence Blvd.   This place will be one of three pho restaurants that we will make it our usual. I got the usual side of rare sliced beef with meatballs and my husband got the pho ga (although it is not listed on their menu) There are only two size options, a medium and a large bowl.   They offer bubble tea and Thai tea as well sake and wine.   I will surely visit back and try their other dishes!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! One of the only Vietnamese restaurants in the Matthews area. Came here and ordered the fried quail, pho dac biet (combination pho), and the combination vermicelli. It wasn't my favorite pho in Charlotte considering the broth was a bit oily and not as flavorful as the places on Central. The combination vermicelli was very good though - probably the best in the city. Will be returning here for the convenience of the location!"}
{"text":"I've only had the stripped steak Pho but it's definitely good. The service was OK, as it took a while for the waiter to come to our table but the turn around on getting the food was fairly quick. They have this neat little section that at first glance looked like something you'd see in a Japanese restaurant where they sit on a pillow instead of chairs, pretty much on the floor but nicely decorated. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"Had the fried quail appetizer and asparagus, fried tofu, snap peas, in a garlic sauce. Great dish."}
{"text":"The previous incarnation of Ben Thanh (on Central, near the old Eastland Mall) was known for their food, but the building itself was a bit, shall we say, decrepit? When they moved into this spot, the food remained the same, and now they have a shiny new spot to match.  In fact, since appearance means so much, it might even have elevated the food - while the service and food has certainly not declined in any way, previously you had to wonder if something was about to fall down around you. Here, not so much. Everything is shiny and new, so you can concentrate on the food, and simply enjoy.  The pho is some of the best around. The bun is tasty as well. Even the noodles and rice dishes will stand up to most anyone. And the service is second to none, right up through the end of the meal, where they offer you these tasty little peanut cookies. Top notch all the way around, and if for some reason you can't get the picky eaters in your family to try it, send them next door to CiCis instead. It's their loss."}
{"text":"The new location is so beautiful and large. I love the large mural on the wall. I had visited the other location and can safely say the food is still the same. I ordered my favorite Pho, Pho Bò vien. It was just the same. The menu looks the same and the service is exactly the same. I took some people to try Vietnamese for their first time and they throughly enjoyed the food and the experience. I would definitely recommend every try Ben Thanh."}
{"text":"I usually drive all the way to shamrock to go to Lang van, however, this place is not only closer, but also cheaper and just as good. I'm addicted to pho and will be back probably every month."}
{"text":"Really like this place will be back soon. Love the boba tea and spring rolls. The noodles are Fantastic"}
{"text":"This is my worse experience in restaurant.The service is very very very bad?rude.I am a service?I know you need to greet when customer come in.But she did't say anything?just take menu to table?I say thank you?but she ignore us.when she bring the food?put food on table very rude.Before she leaving  I try to give her empty plate?she ignore me again.......The food there is so poor?expensive?my food was $13?it was 2 peaces toufu?and some peaces broccoli......."}
{"text":"I tried bun bo hue and hu tieu kho here. Their hu tieu kho is decent. Their bun bo hue tastes nothing like bun bo hue. It doesn't taste bad. The taste is just not right, but if you're not Vietnamese who try that dish kn CA or Vietnam before, you won't realize that it doesn't have bun bo hue taste. The place is clean."}
{"text":"We did Postmates from here and everything was really good. Pho and spring rolls were a nice size and very tasty. I will order from them again."}
{"text":"The Thai coffee is great.  The servers are fantastic.  They'll sub out noodles for mixed vegetables"}
{"text":"This is the place for Pho.  They have a very good chicken with chicken broth pho.  I don't believe it is on their menu, but ask them to make it for you and they will. It is delicious. It comes with all the fixings and of course there is hot pepper oil as well. This is great to add to the pho if you like it even spicier than the jalapeños make it. They even give you a little peanut butter cookie for dessert."}
{"text":"Food was great and we were enjoying it until my boyfriend saw a piece of hair in his food and just lost his appetite. We paid our tab and left . Service was great though ."}
{"text":"My husband and I love getting take out from Ben Thahn! The vegetarian options are delicious, so far Ive tried the fresh noodles, asparagus dish, and the curry noodles -- all tasty and seasoned nicely. The jacama rolls are on point as well!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place, looks clean and service was fine. Nothing really stood out, the ambiance was near perfect, not so much noise and you saw only pleasant faces, however the thai tea was too dark and did not taste good. It is unfortunate that this is the place I wanted to like. Having been disappointed I wanted someone to make it right and called the restaurant, I spoke to Vivian and assured me I could come back and it would be taken care of, now that is great costumer service. Thank you for the hospitality."}
{"text":"Best pho in Charlotte! Great new location with lots of room and friendly service. I have pho ga and they were very nice about substituting steamed veggies for noodles, though it did cost more. Excellent lemongrass curried chicken and fresh rolls as well. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Vietnamese restaurant to go to when I was living in Charlotte. I moved out of state to work and attended graduate school in North Carolina, and finding a quality Vietnamese restaurant on the other side of the world made me feel very close to home.    You will love their fresh and delicious food! The desserts are always my favorite! I would drive 30 minutes just to buy desserts (che) here."}
{"text":"Judging by the pho soup, I'll hv to come again n again. Tasty without being overwhelmingly salty or sweet. Even the bun #40 was perfectly done. Shrimps BBQ'd on a stick on it n the BBQ beef soft n tasty, not dry like most pho places. I'm happy here. It's like finding home 061017:  #26 Pho w/beef round n tendon. Interesting tendon. Was told they received the wrong tendon in shipment. This one looked like a sliced mushroom but the texture was nice n chewy. Never had it b4. Never knew tendon could b different like that. The beef round was tough but that's cuz it's the round. Was told if you want the softer beef that #28 Pho with the brisket is what to order next time. Looking forward!  Now the #40 Bun this time was again very tasty with all the different meats AND a hint of basil which made it special. This bun so far is the best I've ever eaten, really, n I've rated quite a few of them.   I'll be trying other dishes next time. Hope u try this place!!!!! U really will come back again n again. I promise!"}
