{"text":"Amazing food! Great portion size with reasonable prices as well! Was my first time and the employee was very helpful and friendly in guiding me through the \"build your own\" process. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. It's healthy and delicious. The food is fresh and they have a big menu to choose from"}
{"text":"The service was really good; the girl behind the counter offered great service for a first time customer who didn't know the ordering procedure. However, I was not impressed with the food; it was ok. I ordered hummus with gyro meat. The meat consistancy is chunked and moist. The \"classic hummus\" is not the same as traditional hummus; their classic contains garlic and has more of a chunky consistancy rather than thick and smooth. Overall, it was ok, but I will stick to the more traditional Mediterranean restaurants."}
{"text":"I want to preface my review with the fact that my Mediterranean knowledge is based on a handful of places in the valley; some better than others, (in my opinion).  At the risk of the yelp*ing community throwing themselves off Camelback mountain, I have to say that Pita jungle sort of sets the bar for me when it comes to overall taste, portion size, and quality.  Having said that, I was fortunate to try Hummus Xpress (hard to take the place serious with the name) this afternoon.  Based on the reviews alone, I was expecting a lot and was not disappointed. Live music, handful of tables, not much of a line and fairly straightforward system of ordering.  If you read more than two other reviews, I don't have to repeat the process.  It was nice to get some guidance from the line, though I was a little confused by the pricing aspect: .60 cents per item on veggies.  I wasn't clear if that was across the menu or just that region but I was so aware of it that it kept me from really wanting to pile on anymore than a single veggie.  Portion size was adequate, the bowl can hold a lot of food and you fill the bowl easily with delicious ingredients.  I sampled a few flavors of hummus and too be honest, I prefer my hummus warm which this was not but was still tasty.  What seems like a limited menu actually is fairly vast and it would be possible to have the same thing twice only by accident.  Pitas were soft and warm and the iced tea was special.  Push-button iced tea is an abomination so it was nice to see handwritten exotic flavors that didn't make you roll your eyes.  Hummus Xpress (*sigh) is now in the rotation and on the board for a good quality lunch."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great atmosphere!  Love going here for lunch.  Such an array of fresh and unusual flavors. A real treat. The staff are exceedingly friendly and if you are stuck for choice will pick their favorite for you. Even the iced tea is awesome!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, a large variety of flavors and reasonable prices.  If you are wanting a healthy alternative check them out."}
{"text":"So delicious! Great for veg and nonveg ppl. The food is actually flavorful and pretty healthy. The service is also amazing really genuine and sincere. Loved it and would recommend it for lunch!"}
{"text":"We picked this place based on yelp reviews.  Thanks!! This is now our \"go to\" for gyros.
This place offers a nice amount of toppings, awesome make your own pita/plate/bowl.

Please give this local business a shot."}
{"text":"Excellent!!  Terrific service, clean and the food was fantastic!  This was my first visit but I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely great find, simple but accurate middle eastern food. Service is superb, super nice and patient. Food tastes good, Falafel is lacking and not on par with the rest of the meal. Overall a very pleasant surprise in an unassuming location."}
{"text":"Similar concept to Chipotle, but Mediterannean style. The portions were large and the price was good. You either get to choose a plate, pita, or bowl. You then go down the row and get to pick a meat, hummus, salad, and cooked vegetable option as well as unlimited raw vegetable toppings. I order half grilled chicken, half falafel bowl with grilled zucchini, tabouleh, a combination of lemon/ginger and jalapeno/cilantro hummus, and a ton of vegetable toppings. Everything tasted incredible and the employees were exceptionally friendly and helpful. I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Damn, yea this place is great. I like the comparison to Chipotle, it definitely fits.
Its well priced, I got 2 meals for $8-9. 
Standard Mediterranean faire, and well done. You could make all sorts of combos out of their selection.
Definitely check it out either for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Loved my lunch veggie plate. All of the ingredients had their own flavor and texture, although some people may not like having everything piled on top of each other in the bowl. Doesn't bother me!
Hummus was very delicious. Different than others around. I need to get more so I can put my finger on it. The jalapeno hummus was actually spicy which I've never had before. Other places just don't add enough I guess lol
The eggplant was tough and tasted like it was out for awhile so I'll probably skip that next time (I came in at noon so not sure why so stale? ). The pita was very elastic and glutenous which I did not care for but it's not important for a plate. Didn't need it but I would've loved a more bready pita that's just my taste though.
space is small and parking limited so plan accordingly.  Employees were efficient and friendly. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  The owner is the Chef and uses fresh home made from scratch food.  Each dish has delicious flavor!  There are endless combinations!  Even my 2 1/2 yr old son loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Nice little gem in Tempe. A nice variety of hummus my favorite being the chipotle hummus. The food is fresh and delicious and the staff is friendly and very good service. Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"This place never let's me down! A great takeout option ! The meat is always juicy and the various sides are delish!"}
{"text":"I have had this restaurant bookmarked for a long time. I just had the pleasure of ordering today. I ordered the bowl, hoping that I would be full. I was definitely content after enjoying it. The flavors of each item complimented each other very well. Everything was seasoned perfectly. I usually eat slow, but I ate this bowl very quickly. 
Also, my review is based solely on the food taste and quality, I did not dine in or pick up the food myself. I am looking forward to eating here again very soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I eat here once a week. The food is great quality, healthy, and delicious. We've never had a bad experience. Everyone that works here is always nice. We are so glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"One Tempe's highlights! You can basically build tour own dish like at Chipotle. A bowl for example starts with rice, a choice of meat or two veggies, salads (lentils, beans etc), hummus (such as ginger - lemon,  jalapeño, cilantro, plain etc.) and all sorts of fresh toppings like veggies, lettuce, cheese, olives etc and last but not least a sauce (garlic aioli, Chili, yogurt etc). It is served with a pit (wheat or white).
Simple but sooo good and also somewhat healthy compared to other fast foods!"}
{"text":"I never post reviews but this place is a small business that deserves a chance at success and growth because their food and service is that good.  I go there for lunch at least one time per week and I have never had a meal less than great and the staff is always noticeably on top of their game."}
{"text":"Good gyro's. Great selections for toppings. Quick service. Ok hummus."}
{"text":"I love that place. Created my own bowl with rice, gyro, carrots, lentil salad and many other delicious ingredients. Awesome food! Everything is fresh and tastes good. And the owners are very friendly."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mediterranean food in Tempe.   From the hummus to the rice everything is packed with flavor.  The owner is also incredibly friendly and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly staff and did I already say the dood was AMAZING?! Fresh and flavorful dishes consistently.  No complaints here... if you love hummus and/or Mediterranean food, do your tastebuds a favor and try HUMMUS XPRESS!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to get some Greek/Mediterranean food. Found this place using yelp while on a business trip and the rating was spot on. They have many options for your bowl or pita sandwich and all the toppings are very flavorful. Try this place out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious options to make your bowl your way. Their staff is very friendly and always greet you (and remember you if you frequent) they offer samples of the hummus if you're not sure which one to get."}
{"text":"I really do love this place, it's just become too hit or miss. I used to eat here almost every day, along with my staff. The owner Eddie, and Nick always hooked it up and are really friendly. All the other staff they've had over the last couple years make me not want to come back, they'd serve half to a third of the food I used to get, they're not friendly and there was a long spell of risky to the stomach food. I wish I could eat here every day again, I love the food they have on good days."}
{"text":"Independently owned. Operated by some of the coolest workers you'll meet and the food is just great. They always change the menu up a little to keep it interesting with multiple choices of hummus, meat, veggies, salad choices and toppings. If Eddie is there, tell em ZeeDubb sent you lol"}
{"text":"Incredibly happy I tried this place. Easy 5 stars. The staff was great but more importantly the food was better. My wife is here for the Ironman and she gives it the healthy thumbs up too. Wish there was one where I live."}
{"text":"Tried this place today and it was BOMB the gyro bowl was amazing. The staff was friendly and funny. Def will be back"}
{"text":"First time coming here and they were incredibly helpful and kind. The food will not disappoint either."}
{"text":"Food is good and fresh. I am a regular there for lunch. Two minor issues are - firstly that there are multiple attendants and sometimes the serving size really varies from bowl full to bowl 3/4 full. And secondly usage of same serving spoon/tongs for all meats is a bit of a growl for me - It doesn't bother me but I would prefer if serving spoon/tongs are kept separate. The attendants are very polite and nice and almost always wish you when you arrive and when you leave."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and helpful. Food was delicious and full of delicious flavors! Located in a section of town with so many fast food places, this is a welcome find for a healthy delicious meal!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited to come back here!! They had the friendliest workers and willing to recommend different items. Hummus was amazing I got the cilantro jalapeño and the spicy. They were phenomenal! I will be bringing friends here to try it out. This is definately one if my favorite places now. Quick easy delicious you can't go wrong!!! It's a must try"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! We were offered samples of their hummus so we we could make the right choice. If you're really hungry grab the \"Plate\" otherwise a \"Bowl\" will do. Tasty, filling served with a warm wheat or white pita! A must go :)"}
{"text":"Love the food here!! And am here often, almost once a week. Today the portion size for a bowl was half the normal. 1/2 scoop rice, 3 pieces eggplant, 5 pieces of gyro, 1/2 spoon of hummus for $6.95????? Really!!"}
{"text":"First time eating eggplant.  Love it.  Chipotle Hummus is my favorite.  As a vegan, the Three Vegetables are enough, as you can pick toppings and sauces.  
--  The PITA is cheaper than the bowl, with the same portion of food.  
You can't go wrong with any of the options here.  Very clean, professional, super friendly, and Xtremely worth the 6.95 at Hummus Xpress."}
{"text":"I always have a great lunch here.  The options available to mix and match are a great mix of healthy and flavorful.  Today they even had 2 jazz guitarists playing which I hope will be there again."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Great falafel.  Always great service and they're always accommodating.  

Also if you're not sure about anything ask if you can taste it, they will gladly let you try anything."}
{"text":"I went to this place because I needed something to eat on my lunch work break and I try to take the fun relatively healthy approach.

This is NOT another Pita Pit. The owner/CHEF Eddie is right there working hard.

It's like gourmet food to go.  He compared it as the Chipotle of Mediterranean cuisine, I agree but even more so. He told me how the pitas come from a local bakery fresh (can't remember name), and he was most exuberant describing everything.

There were a lot of choices and I didn't know where to start because I don't know this cuisine and Eddie was more than happy to put together a pita combination as he is a chef. He asked me if I wanted vegetarian or not and then he went down the line putting a combination together for me on the fly working with my preferences.

When I finally had my pita (see picture) the flavors were awesome! I was tasting something I could very happily eat in a sit down restaurant. I do not know where else you can get such a high quality food quickly and for a decent cost."}
{"text":"I would not have known about this place but for friends posting pictures of amazing looking hummus bowls on instagram. This place is tucked into a strip mall that, for whatever reason, I have never had occasion to visit despite living 1/4 mile from it for the majority of my adult life. Although strip mall is generally depressing (it's next to an MMJ doctor and a dry cleaner) the atmosphere is clean and modern if a bit stark. 

A reviewer below mentioned that this is sort of a middle eastern Chipotle, which is a useful comparison. You basically chose a bowl, a pita, or a platter. Each option entitles you to a certain number of meats (or vegetables) and an unlimited number of toppings. The proprietor is more than friendly and guides you through the process, perhaps a bit too thoroughly, but it's great to see an engaged small business owner who cares about his product. 

The food is outstanding. I'm a vegetarian and my girlfriend is vegan and there were plenty of options. Every filling was extremely flavorful in a non-cloying way. Sometimes the prospect of eating vegetables and hummus leaves something to be desired, but dishes like the roasted eggplant, cous cous, and the various hummuses (hummusi?) were so interesting and complex that I was excited to go back and try the dishes I missed. 

I would have given the place 4 stars if not for one quibble - VEGAN TAX. Allow me to explain. Some establishments, this one included, do not deduct a dollar (or two) for omitting meat from the meal. There is no way that hummus costs as much as lamb, so in theory, a vegetarian bowl should reflect the difference in price. Instead of reducing the price accordingly, places that charge the same essentially profit from the difference between the cost of a meat dish and that of a vegan dish. In my opinion, this shouldn't be passed off on vegans/vegetarians, and essentially operates as a tax on vegans. If the guy lowered the price of a veggie pita/bowl/platter, I would go here more often.

Vegan tax aside, the food is great and fresh and the staff is nice. I'll definitely go here again and would recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect, healthier option in the Tempe area. The food tastes fresh, the pricing is very good for the amount of food you get and the staff are so friendly. I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I could eat here every day.The freshest most delicious ingredients, and to top it off a wonderful staff! Love everything about this place :)"}
{"text":"This place is great.. I usually go to pita jungle to get my hummus fix but with this place I have no need (other then pita jungles ahi tuna hummus)... The portions are big, I had food for dinner and lunch the next day when ordering the plate. the price is cheap. Great quality, everything I put in my mouth was delicious....

I was in and out in a matter of minutes with my to go order.

Would/will go back and definitely recommend to my friends and family."}
{"text":"So good!  Found on Yelp 3 weeks ago and gave eaten lunch here 3 times since. Very fresh. Cilantro jalapeño hummus has a kick.   Love this place!! Only suggestion is better pita...seems kind of hard"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place would be putting it mildly. 

The veggies and meat from this place are seriously to die for. It's basically like a Chipotle setup but with locally sourced ingredients, diverse and healthy, Mediterranean choices and scrumptious. Pick a pita, plate, salad or platter and choose from something like 20+ choices! 

Really love the diverse amounts of hummus they have. Beet hummus and cilantro/jalapeno are probably my faves together. Stack it piled with veggies, rice, choice of meat, type of salad, additional toppings and ta-da - a masterful meal to enjoy! Oh and the portions? HUGE! Left-overs for days. 

This is a must try if you're in the area. Just writing this makes my mouth water, seriously it's that good!"}
{"text":"When I want delicious variety I come here. You can appease the meat eater in you or go vegan. It is all good. The pistachio baklava was pretty great too."}
{"text":"I would call myself a foodie and have had a lot of Mediterranean food and so the reason I gave this place 2 stars because it the flavors are not quite what I was expecting. It taste like they tried to get too fancy with the food but did not succeed in doing so. The topping they offer have too much going on and leave a weird after taste. They gyro meat is not traditional. It is thick and only somewhat taste like gyro meat. The hummus is ok but it has more liquid than most other hummus. It makes the pita soggy. The pita bread itself is store bought and nothing special about it. But what really moved me to write the review was that I found a hair in my food. I only ate 1/4 of it and was done."}
{"text":"Whoa...I just had the hummus w/ chicken. Great price! Great portion! Almost couldn't finish it all. It was much better than I expected. The hummus was amazing. The employees were incredible nice and helpful. I'm upset I've waited this long to try it. I'll probably be back tomorrow. Heathy food at a good price...doesn't get much better than that for me."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed going to Hummus Express but have found recently that whenever I go with my girlfriend and I we are treated very rudely by whoever is helping us with our food. My girlfriend went in by herself today and when she got back home she told me she felt awkward there because the guy preparing her food was giving her sexual innuendos and hitting on her while winking multiple times. This is not respectable towards customers at all and it is making me be tentative going back which I will hate because I enjoy the food and have enjoyed the service in the past."}
{"text":"Numerous great options to choose from! Who knew ginger hummus existed! The staff were cool & super nice to us. I personally  preferred  take out to eating in. I almost wish the location (strip mall) was a little better..like next to a natural foods store instead of a pet store. Loved it nevertheless!"}
{"text":"Good food but unprofessional employees. Bring it up a notch behavior-wise and you got a great eatery."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum !!!  

I'm so glad finally a place that does authentic Schwma on the Gyro spit.  Delicious meat and toppings with an assortment of well seasoned veggies.  The guys that work there are super nice and offer tastes if you're unsure of what to get.  Nice fluffy Pita with great hummus.  Everything tasted very fresh and home made. This has become a favorite lunch spot if you want to eat healthy fresh food and are tired of going to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and was very impressed. The owner/chef made a ton of helpful (and delicious) suggestions, the food was great and the price was on point. We went mid-afternoon time and the food tasted freshly made. Also worth mentioning-this place is very allergy/vegetarian/vegan friendly."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews, I'm pretty much just seconding most of them.  It really is like a Mediterranean Chipotle:  Pick your size, pick your rice, pick your veggies, pick your meat, pick more veggies, pick your hummus, pick your sauce.  It's awesome, very delicious, everything fresh.  

Price is \"fair\".  Not expensive, not cheap.  Just fair.  My meal with a drink is like $10.

The owner/manager was also incredibly helpful in recommendations, descriptions, etc.  Great guy.

Even had a couple of kids playing sax/guitar a few times, if that's your thing."}
{"text":"The food was very good, but the customer service was bad. 

Arriving during a lunch break, I was happy there wasn't a line. The toppings - \"fill-its\" - were fresh and I liked the choices. The place was relatively clean. 

But the crew treat people impatiently. They give you this look, half expecting you to rapid-fire your selections because (what, there's something else they should be doing) and half impatient that the line doesn't move faster or that they don't want to answer your questions. This is how it goes:

Dude: \"what do you want?\"
You: \"cabbage please\"
Dude: * pinches out three scraps of red cabbage * what else you want?
You: can I get more cabbage please?
Dude: * wags his head * Sorry! We're all about portion control here. Manager. What else you want?
You: can I get olives
Dude: you can get whatever you want as long as you know what you want 
(Direct quote)

Hopefully it was just a bad shift cause the customer service sucks. But the food was good. My coworkers laughed because ordering was an exercise in patience and negotiating. Be prepared to do battle with those dudes."}
{"text":"Hands down my go-to healthy food stop.  Staff are ALWAYS friendly and the food is fresh and made with love. Never disappointed when I walk into these doors. Please don't ever go anywhere...if anything expand and share the love around the valley!"}
{"text":"Still amazing every time. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews people don't know what good food is! Just tried halal guys at Grand opening and this is still my favorite place to eat in tempe!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday with a friend for lunch, right at the height of noon.  They were busy, but handling the rush.  I had a falafel plate, and while I had a short wait for the falafel, the taste of everything was outstanding.  My plate was falafel, eggplant, regular hummus, rice, some veggies and goat cheese with a regular pita (wheat was an option).  My friend had chicken.  We both left full and happy!!  Very affordable for a fresh lunch option in Tempe, healthy and filling as well.  I will definitely be back.  Glad to be the 100th review  Whoo hoooo."}
{"text":"Bland food. Serving wasn't well eg rice was cold, gyro wasn't well done, etc. kale wasnt well cut... not recommended."}
{"text":"One of the best food places in Tempe! Everything is made in house, is super fresh, and incredibly tasty. The gyro meat is the best I've had. And the prices are unbeatable. Ive met the owner and hes very passionate about the food and his restauarant. Cannot recommend enough! Do yourself a favor and eat at Hummus Express!"}
{"text":"If you like chipotle and you like Mediterranean food, then this hits the spot. The choices are better and the food is better."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great and you get a lot of food for your money. The staff is very friendly and considerate. BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! Put on some gloves!!! It is disgusting! I think this is mostly the younger guys that work here and not the owner. One young man had two gloves on, one had one glove on. He grabbed plates and pitas with his bare hands, and the cashier had no gloves on. I watched the cashier touch money, touch food items, then touch money again. Luckily he didn't handle any of my food, I would have politely asked him to put gloves on. He did scoop a side of sauce for us sans gloves, he dipped his finger in the first cup, he tossed that one, scooped another and spilled it on his hand. He then went back to cashiering. This grosses me out to no end. So unsanitary. Please please please educate your employees on food handling!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful service! I wasn't sure how the setup worked but the staff was very friendly, made great recommendations, and they let me sample a few things as well! A bowl has a lot of food- neither my boyfriend nor I could finish it! I love that they offer falafels as a vegetarian option, and the beet hummus is a must try (I don't even like beets). Go here NOW!"}
{"text":"So good every time!! We go here often on lunch break. The employees are super awesome and the food is awesome! Great spot!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly how everyone else described it... the Chipotle of Mediterranean food. The portions are super gracious and the food is awesome. They even got me excited about vegetables. Everything looked super delicious and I can't wait to go back. The staff was super friendly and I even heard them call customers by their names. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Construction shouldn't stop you from eating a dish like this.The menu has actually grown from my last visit it's better.I am all for gluten-free and vegetables yum."}
{"text":"High Quality, 'Chipotle' Style Mediterranean Food 
This is as good as it gets! Service is always very very friendly and their food is fresh, home-made, vegan/vegetarian, and tasty! I am always impressed by the quality of vegetables and meats, their gyro is some of my favorite, the grilled chicken a close second. Their hummus is a huge bonus, made in house, they typically have 6 different types that rotate. I can't decide which is my favorite they are all unique and delicious. Lemon ginger is fantastic,  you won't find it anywhere else, and the cilantro jalapeño is great if you like spice. I recommend any of their 3 or 4 different kale salads as well as their spicy ginger carrots. The 'pita' sized plate is more than enough food for one, and is just around $6 or $7. You won't regret going here."}
{"text":"We were greeted warmly and the chef seemed very enthusiastic about his food. I was expecting the standard fair- hummus, falafel, and salad. I was happily surprised to find so many healthy options- several varieties of hummus, eggplant, kale, broccoli, carrots, lentil salad... they offered me so much I had to order it all in a bowl with pita on the side. All the flavors mixed together perfectly.

A small detail that I appreciated- we were dining at a very slow time of day, but the iced tea was fresh and tasty- no stale left-over beverage from the lunch crowd.

This restaurant will definitely be a new favorite for me."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was taken aback by the freshness and quality of the food here. I was a little nervous about eating at a place in a strip mall, but am very happy that I was convinced to do so. The food was delicious, the staff was very helpful in helping me pick out items, and the portions are extremely generous. The staff described the setup/ordering as \"Chipotle, for Mediterranean food\". This place kicks that 'C' word restaurant's butt. Cannot wait to return. Rice, veggies, gyro meat, hummus, feta cheese, sauce, and pita were all delicious. I'm salivating while typing this up... sorry keyboard :)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best experiences I've had in quite a while.  The employee made sure to greet us and let us know how everything worked.  I built a plate and I told him to just to pick his favorites.  He ended up giving me a btt of all three meats, two kinds of hummus and a ton of toppings.  It was delicious, cheap ($10 for more food than I could eat), and friendly.  Will definitely be going back often."}
{"text":"The best Hummus place in Tempe! The owners are super generous and helpful helping you find a meal that you like. The vegetables are perfectly seasoned and cooked. The array of meat choices is mouth watering and there are vegan options too! Everything was fresh and delicious. Thank god for this place! I loved my ride on the Hummus Express!"}
{"text":"Definitely not the prettiest food out there and I was a little confused how to order but the service was great and the food was tasty. I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff that stayed open a little later so we could get our fix! Beet Hummus, Kale salad, fresh falafel! I highly recommend EVERYTHING on the menu. Seriously, it's quick and delicious! A rarity in a sea of fried fast-food \"restaurants\"."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Quick.   Healthy.  Friendly service.  Soo glad I found this place."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to make it over here after having this place bookmarked for like 5 months now. Just like every other review said before this one, the concept is like a chipotle but with Middle Eastern ingredients. I got as much as I could fit in the plate of awesomeness to include: rice, gyro meat, roasted eggplant, carrots, chipotle hummus, tabouli salad, tzatziki, lettuce and shug (many different spellings of this word). Also, a choice of wheat or white pita was also included. Overall the food was good and I would definitely come back to have some more. The only negative that happened was that they ran out of tahini sauce. Not the biggest deal, but Mediterranean food would be complete without it. Hopefully this place will be able to expand to other locations."}
{"text":"Great schwarma! Felt like I was back in Israel! Highly recommended if you're looking for authentic Israeli schwarma."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! I have eaten here a few times and have had a good experience every time. The food is fast and fresh. My favorite hummus is chipotle. I'm not usually a big fan of eggplant but I love theirs!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The amount of choices is great and the employees are very helpful. We confirmed it was our first visit and they walked us through the food choices.  Got the plate with chicken, kale, lentil salad, cucumbers, tomatoes, and zucchini flavored hummus. So good!! My manager for falafel with hers and they made it right then. Great place and will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Awesome falafel, this place is the best in Phoenix, no doubt, you definitely get your money's worth of hummus,  falafel,  chicken,  and rice, always satisfied. .."}
{"text":"We were set to fail. After watching Eat Street on the Cooking Channel, we new we were setting ourselves up for nothing but disappointment. Out we go to hunt for Moroccan food.  Hey, it's Mediterranean... it also starts with M.

THE PLACE: Very very simple. Not very big and not a lot of seats, but number of seating is just right for the space.  It was clean, although I didn't really checkout the rest room. Decor was very spartan.

THE FOOD: Think Chipotle style, where you get to choose between bowl, plate or a pita. You get a bang for your buck by getting a plate.  The food was tasty. We tried the Gyro and Aleppo Beef.  Had different 'Fill Its' like Rice Pilaf or Saffron Rice, Lemon Garlic Braised Kale, Fried Eggplant,  Char Grilled Tomatoes,  Tabouli Salad, Turkish Salad, Garbanzo Salad, Lentil kale salad, Glazed sweet and spicy carrots, Caramelized onions kale salad and more.  Hefty servings for the price.

THE SERVICE: Staff is very friendly and helpful. Willingly explains all your options, and lets you taste items before you pick out what you want on your plate.  Been here a few times now, and every time always felt welcome."}
{"text":"Great portions, awesome prices. Really fresh food and spices. Best bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"The place is legit.  I had chicken and falafel.  The falafel was a little dry but everything else was very, very good.  Good rice.  Very good hummus.  Someone wrote it was like Mediterranean Chipotle.  It kind of is.  You build your own bowl or plate.  It is unique and really good.   The people helping are also fantastic.   I will go back when in town.  Thanks Yelp community for this find."}
{"text":"What an amazing alternative restaurant! Employees were so helpful with explanations, and my meal was oddly amazing - coming back for sure, and adding it to my top 5 vegan options!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get the most delicious hummus bowl.  I try to visit this place at least once a week for lunch and I love it!  Thanks for always accepting my Yelp check in for a free iced tea. Ice tea is made fresh and is superb!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great customer service,  delish flavors, good price. The braised beef is a must and try the baklava.  A bit pricy but totally worth it. I come as often as possible. You will not be let down with all the choices and flavors."}
{"text":"The place had a nice feel to it, easy, the staff was friendly and helpful with everyone.  When I arrived there was no line but they were able to keep up with demand as the lunch rush progressed. The place filled up with people pretty quickly after I arrived. The food was very tasty. I had the salad with gyro meat, grilled veggies and hummus. All very good, would have been nice to have a 2nd pita bread, but that's just because it was so good, I had the wheat pita."}
{"text":"Hummus Xpress was quite the pleasant surprise.  I enjoyed the variety of options, friendly/prompt service, and the fresh quality of food. It was very affordable and a great place to lunch it up. The establishment was clean(a big deal)."}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant for multiple reasons.

1.) Good value. If you want a bowl, you have two options: Bowl or Plate. They're basically the same, except for the Plate is bigger and gives choice of 2 meats and 2 grilled vegetables instead of 1 meat and 1 vegetables. The Bowl is plenty of food for a meal. The Plate is almost impossible to finish in a sitting... I always have leftovers so keep this in mind when ordering.

2.) Delicious! Everything mixes together really well. My ultimate picks are: rice, double-eggplant, chicken and gyro, classic hummus, white bean salad, cucumber, beets, olives, and cheese, and double red chili garlic sauce (2nd sauce costs extra, which I usually don't pay for, but I said this was my ultimate), and white pita.  The flavor is really good, and unique. I don't know anywhere else I could buy something comparable, and I have tried other hummus-bowl type restaurants. Nothing is as good as this one.

3.) Very healthy. If you read point 2, you'll see that you get all whole ingredients with a good mix of vegetables, meat, and rice. 

I'd recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a quick, healthy meal. It's similar to Chipotle, except a better value, healthier, and a completely different flavor/cuisine."}
{"text":"Awesome med food, and they got the best gyros. I tried their Lamb gyro which was too good. They got variety of hummas and the way they serve food like chipotle is a good idea and different."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! Go! Your taste buds will thank you. So much flavor in one bowl and everything individually, every hummus, every salad is amazing. Been to Mediterranean places and paid 30 dollars for a dish and in comparison they were garbage. Staff is very friendly, helpful and welcoming. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fine alternative to the area but average grub. Had the falafel bowl and was not impressed with it. Small size, small quantity and bland. Sides were dry (rice, green beans), humus was alright. Can't comment on the meat. Won't be back here but glad I tried the place."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for dinner. They provide a rare combination of health and taste, tradition and innovation!

Be sure to try the creative types of hummus that they make and the garlic aoli. 

The staff is very hospitable and they will take the time to guide you through the process.

This is one of the few restaurants that will make you crave vegetables. I encourage you to try the ginger carrots, roasted eggplant, and the various ways that they prepare kale.

I have nothing but good things to say about Hummus Xpress."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I got the \"plate\". You get to pick 2 meats the gyro was tender and very flavorful and melted in my mouth, I got the jalapeño cilantro hummus and al the sides you want with a warmed up pita.  Filled me up and hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Experienced hummus xpress for the first time tonight, and truly enjoyed the experience! The staff was very friendly and helpful and guided me through making my dish. The food was great! I am a fairly picky person and was pleased to find that I loved it! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. Everything is full of flavor and mouthwatering, decently priced and super fast service. Came in lady was very sweet, everyone there is very friendly. I'll will defiantly be coming back here. Hard to find vegan friendly places hummus xpress is a keeper!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have great food and the service is always top notch. It is much like a Mediterranean Chipotle in the sense that you go down the line and choose what you would like for your bowl, plate, or pita. They offer several kinds of meat (gyro, chicken, beef, etc.), many veggies (eggplant, zucchini, kale, seasoned carrots, etc.) and tons of toppings (tabbouleh, tzatziki, garlic aioli, and more). They also have different types of hummus. Try the cilantro jalapeno - it's amazing (although my mom prefers the classic). The staff will guide you and help you choose items that go together. They've never led me astray yet. The owner is friendly, and it feels great to know you're supporting a local business. Oh, and the music they play inside is nice too. :)"}
{"text":"The options for the bowls is unbelievable - quality ingredients and great flavor. Friendly staff dealt with me wanting to sample everything. Highly recommended for a healthy meal."}
{"text":"The best and yummiest of all pita places!! We have been here twice now and plan to come back for many more visits!"}
{"text":"Yep, that's 5 stars. I've been waiting to write my 100th review for someplace special. This place is great. Very much as everyone has reported previously it's a Mediterranean Chipotle, but better.  It's a small place in an older strip mall but nice inside. You get a choice of everything. I ordered a bowl with the most beautifully marinated, tender chicken, grilled zucchini, cooked kale, a quinoa salad with garbanzos in lemony dressing, jalapeño and cilantro hummus, extra toppings and a whole wheat pita. So much food but healthy. A lot of garlic which I'm sure all of my co-workers appreciated since I ate it at my desk. But I'm fairly sure they were just jealous they weren't eating it. All this for about $8.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Kind of complicated menu but everything was tasty but I bet it could be fresher if there was more business.  Love that it's mostly vegetables! Try the beets and kale salad. This is a great option for a healthy lunch in the area. Music is a bit loud and skip the baklava."}
{"text":"Food is excellent!  Portions are large.  The service is fast.  The food is healthy.  The owner served us and was very passionate about his food and restaurant. Id recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood looking for a a cheap, quick lunch. Yelp brought me here. I got the falafel bowl . Basically you can just choose what you want and then mix it all up for you. I got falafel with rice, tabouli salad, cilantro hummus and tons of veggies all for less than $8!"}
{"text":"The owner is from Lebanon, and knows some authentic food. The place opened near my house and their sides for food are great. They cook it more authentic than other \"pita\" joints that just toss some kebab meat on a pita and call it a day. This is the only place that has awesome sides like tabouli salad and roasted eggplant that comes with your meal. They've been known to have live music and crazy business at lunch. Honestly, they have some of the best food and should get recognized for it!"}
{"text":"Good tasty and lots of options for meat and veggies.  Reasonable value.  What makes this place special is the variety of veggies you can get in your meal and not heavily processed food.  Sodium in chicken and gyro was not excessive"}
{"text":"Their hummus is not good. It was really runny, more like a soup or sauce. For $10 i got 1 scoop of red pepper hummus and 1 scoop of the jalapeno cilantro hummus and 3 pitas. Unfortunately they put both scoops of hummus in the same container and due to their watery consistency it kinda turned into a soup/glop combination of the two after my car ride home. I would rather get my hummus from the grocery store, farmer market, or Haji Babba off McClintock in Tempe."}
{"text":"This place never let's me down. Great food and it is clutch when you want something different.don't forget to check in to get the free tea. The egg plant here is fantastic."}
{"text":"First time and here and won't be the last! Very friendly and helpful service with amazing Greek/Lebanese food. Reminds me of chipotle service with great portions. Try it out"}
{"text":"What a deal!!!! So flavorful and affordable!! Definitely going to return!! Puts pita pit and pita jungle to shame!!! The service was super fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I happened to notice this place as I was driving by looking for somewhere to grab lunch.  Ever since making the switch to vegan after already being gluten-free, finding something good to eat that is also convenient has been a challenge!  The name alone was enough to convince me that I should try it out and I was pleasantly surprised to find that almost everything is gluten-free and most everything (other than the meat, of course) was also vegan!  I had a bowl with veggies, hummus and salad and it was delicious!  Not to mention everyone working was super friendly and helpful!  There was even live music during lunch!  What a cool spot.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love Yelp for helping me find this place. Unassuming exterior, located in a strip mall, and most likely not a place I would have tried without the rave reviews on yelp. I would have missed out, big time.

It was suggested I try a bowl since it was my first visit. Layered with Saffron rice on the bottom, the guys were really generous in letting me sample a variety of items rather than limit me to what is typically included. Both lamb and chicken were good, but to me there was no contest - the lamb was melt-in-your-mouth good. Curried carrots had so much flavor, as did the kale. Grilled eggplant and tomato had fantastic char-flavor and texture. They make all their own hummus, and it was truly inspired. I went with the beet hummus since it was deliciously rich. Tahini sauce and red chile sauce made for the perfect accent.  My meal was $7.95 and included a pita. I'm a big eater but even I had leftovers. 



The format reminded me of Chipotle but the food was much more authentic and delicious. One of the guys is from Lebanon. They were genuinely grateful for my visit and I assure you, it won't be my last."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancée came here weekly for the longest time and quality is always top notch but when they have circulated through so many different employees it's hard to keep up with how to order. Example u get double choice of meat that would mean if u wanted only gyro meat u would get two sides before now they charge u extra for not extra when u get the bowl we gave up after being up charged a few times so sad bc the guys that used to work there were awesome! Prices are a little high I'd be willing to pay it more for the double meat if I got it :("}
{"text":"What a surprise! I got the bowl with jalapeno hummus and gyro with pickled veg and grilled eggplant. Every component of the dish stood on it's own and was even better together. A flavor cataclysm in your mouth."}
{"text":"Really good felafel, actually, the best that I've had in Arizona. Hummus is always fresh, potatoes and eggplant are awesome. The owner is always there and is so nice to everyone.  It's right by my office so it works perfect for lunch as the service is super quick. It's basically healthy food that's prepared fast. GREAT place, highly recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food and staff. The menu is fresh and novel. Want to taste something? Just ask. Want to have them customize something? Just ask. This place is the best."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this joint about twice a week. Great food. I typically get the bowl with chicken or gyro meat. Only issue is they're SUPER chintzy when adding toppings. I.e. Onions, tomatoes, etc"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times now. It makes for a pretty easy healthy lunch and I like how they are open at 10:30. Chicken and hot veggies are very good. The carrots and brocolli are some of my favorites. 
Now, the store bought pita bread is tougher than most and is just ok. I have gotten better pita bread at Costco. Hummus needs more flavor and it's super thin! I think they are watering it down to make it last longer. Tzatziki sauce is ok, but pretty watered down as well. If they increased the amount of fresh ingredients and got rid of the prepackaged pita, this place would be excellent!"}
{"text":"They were welcoming and patient with us even when they were about to close in 15 minutes. They gave us samples of all the different options, and even heated up a falafel for us to try. 

Even though they were about to close, they let us eat inside anyways. Super nice of them, thank you! 

The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable in their food. 

All the flavors are vey strong and bold. If you get the bowl, try everything separately before mixing it all together. The cilantro jalapeño hummus has a nice bite, and the chipotle hummus is great as well.

Overall, the food was very tasty and the prices were very affordable for the quality and amount of food given. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Can I just tell you how much I LOVE THIS PLACE?

Luckily I work close by, so I come once a week.  Falafel kicks ass - so I normally get a plate with chicken.  The lemon kale is awesome - and honestly, who gets excited about kale?  The rice is so very good - I think it has sumac?  Anyway, it's delightful.  The hummus is great - I enjoy the roasted red pepper, the white bean salad and Tzatziki are lovely.  
It's a huge amount of food for $10, so get going!"}
{"text":"Food is moderate with a modern twist, honestly had better.  A lil over priced for the quantity served on a small plate.
Although the place is clean and had friendly staff. 
Personally, I've never went back for seconds."}
{"text":"This place impressed me so much, that it inspired me to write my first Yelp review. 

I work about half a mile away from this place, and noticed it was newish driving by. For about 2 months, I intended to try it. Today, I finally took the plunge and walked in not knowing what to expect. 

The place is small, and there were only about 4 people sitting at tables, even though there were 3 people working behind the counter. The place is set up kinda like a Chipotle or a Qdoba - you pick the type of meal you want, and right in front of you are all the different options to include. 

I choose a bowl and filled it with both types of rice, chicken, grilled eggplant, red pepper hummus, lettuce, tomatoes, green onions, and feta. It also came with my choice of a regular pita or a whole wheat pita. Everything looked amazing! Upon my first bites I discovered it TASTED amazing. Everything was good on it's own, and it was every better when I started mixing it all together. I devoured the whole thing. It is very easy to eat healthy here, since everything is so fresh and so tasty. 

I strongly urge everyone to try this place -- they need to stay open so I can solidify it as my regular lunch spot. 

The customer service was superb too -- they explained to me how the meals worked and even let me try the hummus since I must have looked distraught over having too many options. 

My bowl and my pita rang in for less than $8. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"It's rare that I give a place 5 stars but if you're looking for quick healthy food this is the place for you. Lots of flavor and good customer service."}
{"text":"The food is great and is my usual go-to whenever I am feeling Mediterranean or Lebanese. However for some reason I tried to visit last week and there was a sign on the door saying they were temporarily closed. I drove over 10 miles. Sucks because food is awesome here. Also another little complaint is sometimes they can be a little stingy with their portions, especially with the hummus and dressings. Overall tho, it doesnt stop me from going there and eating their food."}
{"text":"Sigh. I wanted to love this place. I wanted it to be my little Mediterranean heaven. Alas, too damn salty! I couldn't eat my food, I had to keep diluting it with sour cream, which usually won't be problematic but it didn't help. I honestly don't know if I will return...maybe once my sodium returns to a normal level."}
{"text":"I really liked the concept of picking your own toppings, etcetera. Each item I picked was well done and tasted great. I was impressed.  The flavor blended well together on the plate. The portion was sizable. 

I have it four stars as the meat had been sitting and was ok and the pita was reheated and dried out. 

I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"\"Build your Own\" Mediterranean bowls and plates? Why yes! Please and thank you!! I love Mediterranean food. I love the option to customize my Mediterranean food exactly how I want so I'm a fan indeed. This was my first time visit and I was so torn between ordering the bowl vs. the plate.  The lady behind the counter told me the plate is huge but carry and heats up well so I'll have plenty of leftovers. The plate comes with 2 meats and all the fixings your heart desires. The bowl comes with 2 meat + all the fixings. I went with the plate for my first visit.

I ordered the braised beef and grilled chicken plate with rice. I topped it with the following items: 

Ginger carrots, grilled eggplant, chickpeas, lemon flavored kale, sautéed onions, beets, white bean salad, cucumbers, tomatoes, roasted red pepper hummus, and tzatziki sauce. Upon first bite, I'm like Whoa! This is delicious. Upon third or fourth bite I realized I had too many flavors and textures together and it was a little strange. The braised beef was warm, the rice was warm but everything else was cold, including the chicken. The chickpeas taste like they came out of the can and into some sort of sauce. That was kinda weird but overall I enjoy it. 

On my next visit I'll leave out the tomatoes and cucumbers as they do not carry over well for leftovers and I'll probably leave off the hummus. That too taste too store bought. 

Lastly, all of the bowls and plates comes with pita bread. You can get white or wheat pita bread. It was hard as a brick. It comes rolled up in foil. It was so hard and cold that when I hit it against the table it sounded as if it was an object, not a piece of bread. It's free but skip it. You won't miss a thing!"}
{"text":"Fabulous flavor!  Would love to see more of these restaurants around the valley!
I keep trying to come up with excuses to even drive by this place for a quick bite - quite a feat from Scottsdale but well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I have a couple of slogans for this place: The Mediterranean/middle eastern version of chipotle! Or Healthy fast food!
I was pleasantly surprised! Wasn't sure what to expect, and what I found was a large variety of vegetables (perfect for vegetarians or vegans), meats, toppings and of course: HUMMUS. The service was very friendly and they allowed me to taste all 6 types of hummus. The hummus options included original/unique flavors such as: beets or all-spice infused; each type was tasty in its own right. Ordered a bowl with lots of different grilled veggies, chicken, tabouli, pickled veggies as well as a very pungent yet tasty garlic aioli! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I walked in and this place is like a pita heaven! It's line style(like chipotle) and WAY MORE TOPPING FOR YOUR FALAFEL! They have tons of meat too. But they have vegan cupcakes on deck, vegan chocolate cake, seasonal lemonade. Omg I love this place. It's not take out, it's organic and fresh and tastes authentic!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from some friends. I love hummus and Mediterranean food, so I figured I would check it out. The location is pretty bad. It's in a run down strip mall. I would typically not drive into this area, so don't let that scare you away!  The woman at the counter was very friendly. I informed her I was a new customer and she gave me the basic run down. I decided to get a jalapeño cilantro hummus pita. I added gyro meat and some veggies. It was delicious!!! I ate the entire thing! It was way more food than I needed, and it kept me full for hours!

My only complaint- It was a little messy, which I didn't like. It comes in a red plastic basket with a thin piece of wax paper. Since the pita was so messy, I had to use a knife and fork to eat it. The basket made this difficult. The paper ripped and exposed the basket. I would much prefer to eat off a plate.  Next time I will try a \"hummus bowl.\"

I definitely recommend you try this place out! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this restaurant on yelp today.  Amazing food!!!  The other reviewers are right!  You won't be disappointed. :-)"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, healthy, and fresh. Lots of vegetarian options. The owner was extremely kind and generous. Overall, a wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"WOW, I have eaten some food before, but this is the most unique and therefore the BEST food I have ever eaten. I have eaten at  your  competition three times before and was already starting to get bored  of it. They lack flavor and therefore lost my interest fairly quickly. YOU GUYS ROCK!!! A new loyal customer.  I am going to bring my wife there tomorrow."}
{"text":"Food is very very bold here with lots of distinct flavors. Was recommended by the dudes behind the counter to go with the bowl. Comes with rice, 1 meat, 1 veggie, 1 salad and as many fix-in toppings your heart desires. Cucumbers, feta cheese, pickled radishes, and tzatziki sauce. On the side was warm pita bread. Also took advantage of the yelp check in for a free tea. 

The only thing that bothered me was the temperature inside of the restaurant. It was so warm that I felt like I had just entered a sauna. We had no choose but to order to-go."}
{"text":"Bowls are amazing. Had the kafta bowl with the ginger lime and cilantro hummus with lentils and cucumbers."}
{"text":"like a mediterranean chipotle. really good portions for the price"}
{"text":"When you walk into this place it just smells phenomenal and reaffirms your decision to eat here. 
I got the vegetarian pita and it was so delicious. The eggplant is so tasty and the potatoes go nicely with it. The roasted red pepper hummus is great, I paired it with tzatziki sauce. So good. 
If given the chance to eat it again I would chose a different game plan (I cut into the bottom of the container with my knife- rookie mistake)."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to eat! It's fast, it's easy, it's cheap...but the food is plentiful, healthy and unbelievably delicious! All my co-workers looove this place and we all come here sometimes twice a week for lunch or dinner. This is the chipotle of mediterranean food, yet sooo much better! You won't be let down, I promise!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I don't like fast food places, nor places that is fast food places but pretend not to be fast food places. Hummus express is a fast food place.. but not only do I like the food, I love the concept and the attitude of the employees. 

So I was going to a barbecue and wanted to bring some hummus. Now, I could have made it myself - but mine isn't as experimentally fantastic as what they make here. Ginger-Lemon Hummus sounds wacky, but it is so obscenely divine that one needs to test it. And talking about faith in your product when you can sample everything before you buy it. 

So I bought some hummus... only the hummus, even if the guys behind the counter told me how I could walk out with more stuff for less money if I followed their lead - but I didn't have to. Instead they gave me hummus, and I paid. WIn-WIn.

I wish there was a way I could convey how awesome i believe this place to be - it will not suit everyone, but give it a shot. Give it a lunch.. its like $6. You could get hooked like me, or you could let the world know that you are not a connoisseur of fine experimental food, but a boring old meanie-face that smells of Chicken McNuggets.

If you do take my advice, drop my name.. and they will have absolutely no idea who I am ;)   - A 6th star for the attitude of the employees."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow.

I came here not really knowing what to expect.  I tried it for the first time today and I already can't wait to go back.  

The layout is much like Chipotle.  The two dudes that were working were super nice and super helpful.  It was my first time so they let me try a couple things and gave me advice on what was best.

Ready for this: I ended up getting a bowl with rice, fried eggplant, some sort of broccoli, chicken, lentil kale salad, red onion, tomato, a little bit of tzatziki and jalapeno cilantro hummus.  With a wheat pita on the side.

It was nothing like I expected but oh my god it was absolutely amazing.  All of the flavors just meshed together.  You taste a little bit of everything, but it's almost like you don't taste anything separate.  You just taste one big bowl of all these different flavors formed into one.  Words really don't do this place justice.   

The one thing I will say is don't be scared to do something a little out of your comfort zone.  I told them I don't like eggplant, they had me try it and it was the best eggplant I've ever had.  Some of the stuff they have there might seem a little out there, especially for someone like me who has a very American pallet.  Don't let that scare you and trust the people that work there.

If you aren't afraid of something a little exotic, you HAVE to go here.

If you are a little afraid of exotic, you HAVE to go here.  

This is one of those places where you just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"First experience yesterday! It was AMAZING. Employee was extremely nice and helpful. He walked me through how this place works and described what everything in the window was. I've heard good things which is why I walked in, but I was more impressed. So so good!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome quick food!  I loved the beet hummus & kale onion salad.  The falafel was over cooked though but still good. 

If you don't like your food to touch then don't go here. It is all served in one bowl. 

So yummy!"}
{"text":"Man this shit was too good I try something new with that I never would and it turned out to be amazing I'm definitely going to dine  in with them in the next few days"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. I've been coming here for a few years now. It's one of places in Tempe where you can actually eat healthy. The staff is super friendly. The food is consistently delicious. You guys are nailing
It"}
{"text":"i really loved my falafel pita. i was a little bit skeeeered at first to create my own, ya know, with the classic falafel pita creation being so divine. but i went for it. i added roasted beet hummus, fried eggplant, garlic aioli (put this on everything, please), tatziki and some other goodness. i went there for lunch and seriously though about going back for dinner to try another version. can't wait to go back. solid stuff."}
{"text":"Great concept and food. Went in for the first time tonight and got the falafel pita with eggplant and couscous. The falafel was better than most places in town but seemed to fall apart a little too easily. Will definitely be back here"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Service and food are both great. Would definitely recommend you stop in and try it out"}
{"text":"Meat was amazing and the concept was different. You should get the plate and have the lamb meat, soooo good."}
{"text":"We went by Hummus Xpress one evening and were very surprised. When we arrived, we were a little bit skeptical and debating whether or not to even go in but I'm really glad we did! This little place is pretty much like Chipotle with Mediterranean food.

I didn't really know what would taste good together so I honestly just followed the recommendations of who was making my bowl. I think I ended up with rice, chicken, cilantro jalapeño hummus, garlic herb potatoes, tabbouleh, and some toppings. My date has gotten a bowl with some fried eggplant which was delicious .. I regretted not getting that!

This place seems a little bit expensive for lunch - mostly because I normally don't want that much food anyway but it's still much less than other options. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Their food is packed with flavor.  A little too much for me to be honest but I still really enjoyed coming here.  The fellas behind the counter were very nice.  Awesome ingredients to choose from.  It' cool how you can pick and choose what you want in your bowl  If we are in the area we would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Quick! Easy!  So glad we tried Hummus Xpress.  My chicken pita was great but I didn't expect so many delicious salad and side options too.  Can't wait to come back again and try more"}
{"text":"It's always fun to find a great little restaurant that serves excellent healthy food choices where the portion sizes are just right.  The protein and vegetable choices that accompany the hummus are all delicious.  The wait time on the food preparation is very short and I was able to eat here and be back to work in an hour without feeling rushed.  The price and the quality of food make this restaurant one of the best finds I have come across in the Tempe area.  

Will return (often) and would recommend to family and friends!"}
{"text":"These guys know their stuff!  There isn't much I can say about it that hasn't already been said.  The staff is friendly, the food is very high quality and the overall experience is fantastic.  The different types of hummus are delicious, their meats are always succulent and the veggies are fresh.  What more can you ask for?  Plus they'll do whatever they can to help customize your orders to best suit your needs.  Oh, and they have the best eggplant I've ever had, and I'm not just saying that."}
{"text":"Fabulous find!  After an hour at REI, we were starving and told about this place. It's like a Middle Eastern Chipotle!  You can choose a pita, bowl, plate, or salad and add meat (gyros or veggies, too), vegetables, toppings, flavor of hummus and dressing.  The staff were SO friendly and helpful. The bowl was a perfect size...very filling. You can choose the \"regular\" flavors or some of the more authentic flavors....like Moroccan veggies. We loved it and wish we lived closer. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Yum. Fast, authentic, healthy and delicious! I will be back, probably tomorrow:) Not to be missed."}
{"text":"This place has a really good hummus selection and the veggies and sauces they have to accompany everything is spiced and just delicious. I've been there a few times and I like my creation every time :) Good price too!"}
{"text":"TOO frickin' die for!  PLEASE open more locations in the Valley!   Great job!"}
{"text":"Long on my list of quick lunch places to try, I finally made it to Hummus Xpress. And, I have hence determined this is an immensely dangerous find as I work nearby and will have to give them all my lunch money in exchange for tasty Mediterranean food. 

Similar to the Chipotle-style of choosing your ingredients (and having no one to blame but yourself if the combo is questionable), you first choose between a bowl, salad, pita or plate. Then all the options begins... 

Chicken, braised beef, falafel, veggies, or gyro leads to a selection of 7 hot veggies ranging from lemon kale to fried eggplant. Then you made choice on 6 different hummus flavors (cilantro jalapeño actually has a bit of a kick!) Then salad choices (tabouli, kale onion, lentil kale) to finally finish off with an impressive array of toppings. Everything is full of flavor and cooked well, and the staff was efficient and nice. 

I'm already plotting my next bowl for my return visit."}
{"text":"For what it is, Hummus Xpress is fantastic.  Quick, casual, Chipotle style ordering.  And if you order a 'plate' for $10, you're really getting two or three meals.  Everything I've had here has been good or great, standouts are all the hummus, the eggplant, and the tabouli salad

Don't drive across town for it, but definitely hit them up if you're in the area"}
{"text":"So based on the outrageous reviews I just stopped here for lunch.  They must be padding their reviews based on my experience. I ordered a pita with grilled chicken, jalapeño hummus and kale.  I also ordered a side of falafel.  The pita was ok enough.. Nothing really special with it or the chicken.  It was nice to have kale, one of my favs, as a topping.  The falafel was brought out to my table and was really dark brown turning to blackish. I tried part of one and they were disgusting.  I took them back to the counter and being full from the pita, told the guy I didn't want anything else but they should be a bit more care because the falafel was way too fried.  He promptly told me I didn't know what I was talking about.  That he's from Lebanon and has eaten falafel his whole life.  I said it's still over fried.  He then ask me if I wanted him to give it to me raw because he could do that...I turned, said 'interesting customer service here' and left.  I'd never go back and would recommend you don't either."}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place and I had tried their hummus before and loved it. We went tonight and I got the gyro bowl. The gyro meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly. You get to choose your meat and a grilled vegetable. Then you get to choose between 3 salads and a choice of hummus. You also get to choose your sauce and toppings. The staff is so nice and the food is so good and very fair priced. We will be back!"}
{"text":"In the area and the reviews were great so we stopped. I am so glad we did. Great food. It's like a Mediterranean style Chipotle. Everything is fresh and tastes wonderful. We voth got bowls, and we were so full we didn't eat it all."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars for the food and friendly staff.  
I had a pita with hummus, rice, veggies.  The pita was fresh and soft and might be the best one I ever had.  The red pepper hummus was perfect.... Not overwhelmed by garlic as you find some restaurants serve.
The veggies were wonderful... Cooked just right.  I had a piece of baklava for dessert that was pretty good. 
The staff was genuinely friendly and very efficient.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I would say the good is pretty alright here. There were a lot of bold flavors that I don't think I was ready for, but it was good nonetheless. Right when we got there, the two men behind the counter were very nice and welcoming. The heat though, was not welcoming. We chose to get our food to go because there was no way we could sit in that room to enjoy our meal. 
Anyways, the guys made our meal easy to choose from all the choices and were very helpful as we were first timers. If you can, get the tea. I think I enjoyed that more than the actual meal. Great service, and I can see good for others, just not my thing I don't think."}
{"text":"This place is such a refreshing change of pace from all the other mediterranean joints that serve the same old falafel, hummus, pita. etc. Hummus Xpress is an exciting new addition to that boring line up. 

I've been wanting to try out the restaurant  for awhile after seeing it featured in the New Times, but I rarely find myself in Tempe. I ended up taking my parents there before seeing a show at Gammage. We all left very full and happy.

The owner explained all the menu and all the offerings for the day. I got a falafel plate which was a ton of food. It comes with one veggie side, but the owner threw in a few bites of all of them so I could try them out. The falafel was fantastic, and I fell instantly in love with the spicy carrots. I got the lemon ginger and beet hummuses since those were the most unusual sounding. They were both super good, and more unique than the standard hummus I make at home.

My parents were happy with their meat based dishes. I thought it was interesting that one of the choices was brisket. Unexpected for a mediterranean place, but that's the beauty of Hummus Xpress."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad.  Service was extremely slow on a slow day.  Definitely not the service at Chipotle.  The staff make it more complicated than it needs to be and basically took 20 minutes to get food with only 3 people ahead of me and at east 3 people working the line but all seemed confused."}
{"text":"Yummy, authentic. \"Treated like a queen\" ;) I had the spiciest hummus version. Lots of food. The drinks are small."}
{"text":"I love you.

Fresh, great food.  Great people.  What more can you ask for?

I love Mediterranean food but always struggle with what dish to order, because I want a little of each flavor from each of my favorite dishes.  Problem solved, you can get anything practically here."}
{"text":"Awesome food, good customer service.  
If you're unsure ask what they recommend , always good suggestions."}
{"text":"A coworker suggested we go here and I wanted something hearty so we ended up here. Staff was friendly and the food was amazing. I had the braised beef and chicken plate. The beef was perfect and tasted fantastic. Chicken was fine but I wasn't too thrilled with the flavor of it. The tabouli salad that I picked with the plate was very good and I had the chipotle hummus which was very rich and flavorful. The only thing that I would suggest is that a plate meal should come with two pita instead of just one. I'm from out of state but whenever I'm in the Tempe area, I plan to come here again!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Tempe. The egg plant and garlic aoli are to die for. This place puts the \"yum\" back in hyummus."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch stop, based on Yelp reviews obviously, and was surprised by how fresh the food was. I got the two meat plate with chicken and gyro, and I could not have been more happy. Flavor is on point, meat is not overcooked, and all the sides are readily available for whatever your Mediterranean palate desires. 
Tip: check in when you get here to get a free tea, which was also delicious."}
{"text":"It's like an awesome Mediterranean food Chipotle! Pick what you want for your bowl and chow down! They have excellent hummus too which is a plus since it's in their name. If you haven't tried them don't miss out. If it's been a while what are you waiting for!"}
{"text":"Subway Mediterranean style.   A great, healthy option.

Pro's: Everything is fresh and made onsite.  No processed, pre-made foods here.

Cons: To many choices, options, combinations. But in a good way.  

I opted for a plate.  After the meat and veggies, I was in the home stretch and got stuck in the hummus selections.

Guess I'll have to come back and try a new combination next time.  ;)"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in the Tempe area. Very friendly staff with a great variety of food to choose from. Very happy with my experience, will be back very soon."}
{"text":"This place has great vegan options, and in general has my favorite Mediterranean style food. Also they have a very friendly staff, go give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet? Coworker (vegetarian) never knew veggie dishes could taste this good, and his carnivorous partner in crime (moi) is happy with their gyro meat and sometimes crazy hummus options. A nice mix of Mediterranean inspirations- sometimes Moroccan veggies, some Greek inspired options, more Middle Eastern things, many with modern twists...all of them in a \"build it your way\" Chipotle-esque style. And check in for free tea! Yah! Best tabbouleh in town, p.s."}
{"text":"Extremely generous quantities of the most delicious vegetables, hummus, meats and other complimentary ingredients. Would recommend asking the owner for guidance on which ingredients taste best together (as you get to select and choose the combination for your meal, and there is a wide variety to choose from).  I ate here with my family and we all were totally impressed by the quality and flavor of the options (and the quantities).  Very reasonably priced, casual small setting, friendly owner.  Definitely give it a try if you have the opportunity."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for gyros.  They have so many fillings to choose from you will never run out of combinations.  Like other reviewers have posted, it's like chipotle but for Mediterranean food.  The food tastes great.  I tried the jalapeño hummus and was very pleased.  First time having kale in a gyro and it was very tasty.  Their tea is really good also.  They have mango, peach, and regular. This will be my go to place when I'm in town for business.

Update:  I just got a free baklava!  Flaky, sweet, buttery goodness.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing hummus, and the guys in the truck are just the best! Polite, fun, delicious, it's a great experience all around, and the food is top notch!"}
{"text":"Been eating here for a year or so. Consistently awesome. Fresh, healthy, delicious, and excellent value. Perfect quick lunch spot in Tempe. Wish they had the beet hummus all the time but they only use ingredients in season, which speaks to how great they are. When choosing amongst veggies, the eggplant is to die for. Can't go wrong with any of the protein options. Bravo Hummus Xpress."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I have brought a lot of people here, and it never disappoints! The staff is friendly and the food is amazing. Warning: LOTS of garlic! But I love it. All fresh. Always good. The place is small, so if you come during a lunch rush, taking your order to go is a good option. The gyro meat is delish. The potatoes are AMAZING. Rotating variety of delicious hummus. I love the salads because the base includes kale but has romaine mixed in, too. It's a lot of food. You won't regret coming here! I do wish the pitas were served warm. That's probably my only criticism. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm constantly serching for quick healthy lunch options. This place is exactly what I was looking for!  It's basically like a Mom and Pop Chiptole with Mediterranean Food. Everything was colorful, fresh, healthy. I will be adding this to my frequent lunch spots!"}
{"text":"Great place! Fresh food, good people behind the counter. Great option for vegetarians. Happy to have this in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Everything I had here was great! The vegan options are clearly marked and they give you a lot of food for the money. If the sign says spicy believe it!"}
{"text":"Whoever left a review and said it was like a Greek Chipotle (there were many of you) really hit the nail on the head. It's pretty much exactly like Chipotle in terms of ordering and portion sizes. (BUT they were significantly more stingy than Chipotle when you ask for more toppings.)

It's not made apparant, but you can ask for unlimited toppings at the end. It's the step after the meat and \"special\" veggie section, and before the sauces area. If you're confused, I'm convinced they do it on purpose.. because they don't label the \"unlimited\" area like the others, and there's no sign that says toppings are included. But somehow, everything else is labeled perfectly lol.

Anyways, each bowl comes with a pita, which is awesome. Also, my food tasted amazing, especially the eggplants. The eggplants were REALLY good, I highly recommend them.

It's important to note that it's a little more expensive than Chipotle. It costs about $18 for two bowls, without tip. Not really happy about that price.

Can't say I didn't love my food though. I really, really enjoyed my gyro bowl!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch, was mightily impressed by the choices, combinations, and flavors. I chose to do a plate and selected the grilled tomatoes, lamb, and chicken schwarma. I proceeded to try the lentil salad, and other sides. There were many different types of hummus and sauces to choose from. I can't wait to come back and try the others!."}
{"text":"It's hard to add much more than what is already written for this restaurant, which properly backs up the high 4+ star rating (as of this review).   The owner/chef definitely cares about his food, the quality is high, the recipes amazing (the best roasted eggplant I had ever had) and the food a darn good value.   

Although I won't deduct any stars because from a food standpoint it was so good, I would suggest the following:

1.  Great concept - and well explained on the website, but the limited chalkboard menu above the food line doesn't make it abundantly clear what your options are (such as an extra veggie costing more - and if so, how much?

2.  Consider a side of hummous w/out the meat/fill-in or falaffel.  Maybe a small side to accompany a pita for 2 bucks or so.  The regular hummous I tried was amazing.  I'd gladly order a pita and then add a side to that order.

3.  Expand to the west side!  This is a great restaurant and concept - I passed by as I work not too far, but won't forever.  I will definitely miss this place when that day comes."}
{"text":"Chipotle meets Pita Jungle... this place is great! Get extra eggplant, it's to die for :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots.  Have yet to have anything but a positive experience.  Staff is always friendly and the food is some of the best."}
{"text":"Hummus Xpress is the best.  I love the babaghanoush and the fried eggplant.  Both are to die for. My girlfriend loves the lemon kale salad.  Everything tastes fresh and it is always ready so it's quick to get your food.  They have really good pistachio baklava as well.  Definitely give it a try, you will be hooked.  I also hear they have free wifi."}
{"text":"I can not get over this place. The food was amazing, the service was amazing, oh and did I mention that the food was out if this world? 
Honestly was not expecting much, my boyfriend and I were hungry and wanted to try something healthier... So we went in, split a plate and a hummus bowl, and had left overs. The food was so good, we are going back again tomorrow for more. I have a feeling I will be a regular. ;)"}
{"text":"There's been enough reviews about the style of service here, so I'll restrict this to the food and the customer service. The food is phenomenal and it's clear that care, thought, and effort are put into each item. I came here in a party of 4 and everyone cleaned their plate. With how generous their portions are, that's impressive.

There's been some complaints in these reviews about the staff being impatient. My experience is that the staff absolutely expects you to know what you want, because you're an adult, but I didn't encounter any sass or frustration from the staff. Furthermore, two of my party were real, real old. Despite being confused and difficult to deal with, the staff treated them very well and were very patient.

All in all this was a great lunch, and I'll be back soon. I expected nothing less from a guy who made me actually miss a pizzeria, and Eddie did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great staff and great food. Enough options to have some variety each visit...or you can just stick to your favorite combos. My mouth's watering just thinking about today's lunch.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always a delicious meal and great value for what you get. The guys are always so helpful in making recommendations, especially with unique mixing of the sauces."}
{"text":"Yummy food! Tried the Gyro plate with rice. Reminds me of a chipotle as they had a counter you order to chose what you want it in. Everything had so much flavor. Next time I'm planning on getting stuff on the side just to not throw the rest of the flavors off (dressing, Hummus)."}
{"text":"These guys are the best Greek food hands down. Gyro meat is on point, incredible selection of veggies and hummus. Amazing for vegans and meat lovers alike. Definitely worth supporting this great local establishment."}
{"text":"Maybe I didn't pick the right things, but in a chipotle style place, it's hard to fuck it up... what I got was a buffet of mush that sounded good separated but when thrown into a bowl together became a bit too messy in my mouth. Random flavors were mixing that I did not enjoy mixing together. I can't say I would be back here again but people seem to like it because it was busy. Also they DO NOT USE SAFFRON in their rice as 15+ people in the yelp reviews have suggested... That goes to show the knowledge of Mediterranean food these people who eat here have. It is minute quick rice. And not everything yellow is saffron! Jesus! I wasn't looking for authentic but come on, they could do better than that! Their tea is good tho, I'll give them that. And service was friendly and welcoming. Suggestion to the owner: they need more seats, I felt rushed eating there because of the limited seating and people waiting for a table. Id suggest outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and healthy! Huge portions and a great deal. Do yourself a favor and get sauce on the side so you can take some to go. Everyone that worked there was nice and welcoming. Servers helped first timers figure out the menu."}
{"text":"So many things to love about this place.  

Food is consistently amazing - so much flavor and variety!  Every time I eat at Hummus Xpress, the owner is there on the front line preparing and serving this authentic Mediterranean cuisine.  

Very affordable spot for the quality and if I worked closer, I'd probably eat here several times a week.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good flavors and lots of toppings to pick 
About $9 bowl pick you meat and unlimited
Toppings"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  The food is great, and service is super friendly. They are set up like a Mediterranean Chipotle.  Healthy food (yet super delicious) made just how you want it. Their hummus is some of the best in the valley. All the veggies and veggie salads are delectable.  They have tons of toppings!  You must try this place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went not knowing what to expect and we were pleasantly surprised. Tons of options! Think Chipotle but Mediterranean and more side options. Overall VERY satisfied. Great flavors on all the different sides (again, so many options!) Looking for a good meal that's not too pricy? Hummus Xpress for sure. When I went there weren't many drink options. Canned soda and waters were all that you could purchase. I don't drink soda and sometimes water just doesn't hit the spot like a nice tea or other non-carbonated beverage would. I hope that once the business picks up this could be updated to provide other options.

It's a small place, but great menu/decor/atmosphere design inside (something I appreciate a lot).
I hope this local & original place does well."}
{"text":"this review is specifically for the \"fresh squeezed\" lemonade. it is fresh squeezed, however, that is the squeeze of a lemon juice bottle. it was so gross. I went up to purchase a soda to replace it, told the cashier about it and was not offered a replacement. oh well. the sweet potatoe hummus was awesome."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!! Have been wanting to try this place for several months now and today I finally did. The owner walked me thru the process since it was my first time and I filled up the bowl with lots of goodies!! I can't wait to go back.....maybe tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I went there for the first time today. I asked them how the menu combinations work, I also explained that I am vegan. They took their time to explain the menu to me, which I liked. There are so many different combinations you can throw together. Lots of meat for those that like that and plenty of fillers such as roasted veggies, salads, toppings and fantastic hummus. I got a bowl with a pita on the side. I would do a plate next time for dinner. The bowl is perfect for lunch. You get your choice of wheat or white pita.
The staff is so respectful and helpful. I will definitely make this one of my regular weekly places to eat. Very excited to have found this place!"}
{"text":"Maybe I should've known that this wasn't my type of place, as I dread Chipotle-style assembly-line food, but I do love Mediterranean food, and Chipotle-style greek and Mediterranean seem to be all the rage these days. I have to say, though, that while I admire the number of options offered here (many more than Chipotle itself), the food didn't taste particularly authentic to me.

I chose to forego meat for falafel, and this may have been my first mistake. The falafel I got lacked the satisfying crunch I look for, and was frankly pretty bland. The pita was lacking as well, and was more the texture of grocery store pita than proper pita, which is generally far less doughy. Honestly, I let the owner recommend most of the items I chose for the bowl, as I wanted to make sure they'd go together well. They didn't, and it tasted more like a random jumble of food than a Mediterranean meal. It was certainly an ok value for the price, but that doesn't mean much when it doesn't taste that good."}
{"text":"I have to dock a star because we've stopped here several times when they were closed but their posted hours said they should be open. In fact, that happened three times and I didn't want to try again, but today we decided to stop in. It's a really great concept, kind of like a Mediterranean chipotle. They are super concerned about food costs and therefore quite inflexible about substitutions. I can understand, although the way the bowls are structured, it's hard to avoid certain ingredients that aren't universally liked. Overall, we really enjoyed the food. everything was super flavorful, especially the eggplant."}
{"text":"This place is unique. Its a chipotle style restaurant gone Mediterranean style. I ended up getting the salad with gyro meat and loaded it with all the toppings and some zucchini with jalapeno hummus and dressing on the side. It is a big salad and it left me full for hours after. It is also really tasty. I paid $9 for everything out the door which is a pretty good price considering that it left me full. All of their menu items are around the same price except if you buy a sandwich which is a little bit cheaper. 

I also used them to cater my daughters 1st birthday. For the quality this place is a bargain. Everyone loved the food. They set it all up and provided utensils, napkins, and plates. The owner, Eddie, is really nice and he goes the extra mile to make sure you are satisfied. I highly recommend this place as a place to get a quick bite or for them to help you with your catering needs."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it more stars! The BEST place for vegetarians/vegans! Balanced, healthy, tastiest mediterranean food ever."}
{"text":"Flavorful and fresh and healthy ! Trifecta ! Go here now , dont hesitate. Although it's in a strip mall,  the inside is quaint and pleasant ."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place!! As a vegetarian it's hard to find convenient options that don't lack in flavor. They never disappoint and I love that they are always changing it up with new items. They are so many flavors and combinations to try, doesn't get boring."}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend and I come here all the time and the owner always remembers us. The food is amazing with great service and a reasonable price! The falafels are made the order and the lamb melts in your mouth. Amazing Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Finally someone is keeping it real in Tempe! I love what this guy is doing! If you are in the area you should go here!!!! Average price for lunch and it only takes a second to get your food."}
{"text":"Delicious!! We've been craving Lebanese food and are so happy that there's a place in the valley that has Lebanese dishes! Awesome concept-- can mix and match tons of middle eastern sides and dishes. All are so good. The falafel, basil cilantro hummus, rice pilaf, and shoug(?), and eggplant are so tasty. Great because you can mix and match to get lots of variety and flavor. The owner is really nice and super friendly too. An ideal place for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Never really go wrong at the Humms Xpress!! I love this place. It is very small inside so be prepared to meet a new friend. The food is really good. They staff are really informative and they will give you great suggestions. I personally recommend the Jalapeño Humms with tabouli salad! Give this place a try. It my not look like much on the outside but very delicious on the inside!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last week. Flavors were really good!! But I only have them 3 stars based on service. I got beets on top of my pita. I get home and take my first bite but there was something rock hard I bit into. It was a raw beet. In fact all the berets in my pita were raw and rock hard. I was very disappointed. I had to sit there for a couple minutes to pick them out. I wanted to let the manager know, so I called. In fact I called FOUR times and nobody answered the phone. It went to a generic automated voicemail that said the mailbox was full. So I went online and contacted them and let them know. It said I would received a response within 72 hours. A week abd a half later, no response. I'm not saying the food I received want good, it was. But the lack of customer service and raw beets is bad."}
{"text":"A great restaurant hidden in Tempe.

I am a big fan of Mediterranean  cuisine so I am quite happy that I finally decided to check this place out. I ordered a bowl and had more than enough food, especially for under $10. The woman helping me was quite friendly and even more so once she found out that it was my first time in. I went with most of her recommendations (aleppo beef, jalapeño/cilantro hummus, cauliflower, etc.) and for the most part it was delicious. The piping hot pita bread (choice of regular or whole wheat) was awesome too! 

My only complaint was that the beef seemed to be mostly fat, although it was seasoned nicely. Maybe I'll try the chicken or gyro meat next time.

Planning to return very regularly!"}
{"text":"This is a good spot if you are looking for a quick, cheap, and relatively healthy meal.  Also, while I dont eat it, the meat looks great and I saw them butchering it themselves in the back.  The chef explained that they cook it overnight at a low temperature...sounded and looked delicious.

This is also a solid spot for the vegetarians here.  Lot of options, and a lot of food-you will not leave hungry.  The reason its 4 and not 5 stars is simple: I would prefer them to give the customer the option of putting all of the different foods in seperate containers instead of meshing them alltogether in one bowl.  I would prefer to be able to taste the hummus, tzaziki, tahini, etc all seperately as they are delicious in their own right.  As it stands now, they serve it all together in one bowl and tastes fine, but you cannot differentiate between all of their different foods."}
{"text":"We went to Phoenix over winter break and found this gem on yelp. The food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. I got the bowl and it was very filling...even had enough left to share with the kiddos. I wish there was one here in LA."}
{"text":"Wow! Absolutely terrific! This is one of the best places I've eaten at in Tempe and it's really affordable. I'm going to be a regular here!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, you're doing yourself a true disservice. Their hours are a little frustrating with my work schedule, but the one day a week where I actually can go, I go. The food is ALWAYS fresh. Tons of vegan options too, if that's your thing. Prices are excellent and the portions are huge. Customer service is also top notch. I've tried to find one, but I seriously do not have one knock against this place besides the hours of operation. Best food in Tempe."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding and the food was fresh and tasty. We shared a hummus plate with chicken on it. Loved the ability to add my favorite veggies. The jalapeño cilantro hummus has a delicious kick to it! The regular hummus with garlic was good too. It was so good, we ordered The roasted red pepper  hummus to take home for game day tomorrow. YUM

I really wish there was one in Gilbert, I would be a regular!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh! Their garlic aioli and lemon ginger hummus have me totally addicted!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? How does this place have so many good reviews? The chicken is cold and old, the beef is soggy and also old,the hummus tastes worse than the one you can buy in a grocery stores, the pita is cold and hard, there was literally not a single good thing in my bowl. The only good thing about this place is that that the guy who helped us was pretty nice, but the food is absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"I was blown away by the quality. Don't be fooled by the location. This is not subway or a place that uses garbage frozen food. The good in this place has flavor that can't be matched.

Do yourself a favor and give it a shot. I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is like a Mediterranean Chipotle (and better). It's a small space, but it doesn't disappoint! They have a variety of hummus, meats, veggies, and sauces. They are priced the same as chipotle, but the quality of the food is better, in my opinion. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Came over to eat a pita bowl.  I had the chicken and gyro with jalapeño cilantro hummus which was very tasty and spicy.  The bowl was quite filling.  Come here if you like to choose your own mixes to your own personalized pita bowl."}
{"text":"I love this place, the have 6 different flavors of delicious hummus and lines are never too long.  the food is healthy balanced and the portions are big.  

Good Job Hummus Xpress, count with me as a frequent client  :)"}
{"text":"I love hummus and I love \"build your own\" restaurants so this place is perfect!! There are a lot of options so every bowl/plate is unique. The veggies are fresh and well seasoned. I love all the sauces and the option to have a little spicy kick in my dish if I'm feeling up for it. Fast, friendly service makes this a place I'll return to often."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place with some vegan options and this place definitely has a lot of options for that. The lady had amazing customer service however the veggies were over salted and my falafels were overdone while I do appreciate the fact that they were fried on the spot.
I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place. The bowls are so good and so big because you get to add whatever In it ! The kale salad is to die for and so is the rice and hummus.  I love how you can put as much veggies as you so I always load up on those.  Been here 2 days in a row"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Get plate! w/ pita on the side.
Amazing....
Eggplant, Zucchini, Brazed beef, Gyro, multiple flavors of hummus specially Lemon hummus. Beets, Fetta, Potatoes. Veggies are amazing. So many options to make your own... The Garlic chili sauce has a mouth watering zing that you crave weeks later..."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Mediterranean food in the valley. I had a bowl which is very well served, all the toppings are fresh, you get a choice of a protein I tied the braised beef and it is excellent. Then you get to choose as many toppings as you want. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you're looking to grab a bite to eat in the Tempe area, I highly recommend this place! Not only does this place have thee best hummus in town, the food is always on point. I have yet to be disappointed after coming here. Food is delicious not to mention they have a lot of vegetarian and vegan options. The owners are super chill, and usually there helping out the team and always friendly. You can tell they truly care about the quality of their food and the happiness of their customers. I can say after trying every single hummus; jalapeño cilantro is still my favorite. Why would you not like this place?!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and wow - the flavors were out of this world! I eat a mostly vegetarian diet - so I can't give you a good review on the meat, but the vegetarian bowl was bursting with flavor. There were so many options of fresh cooked veggies, hummus and toppings to choose from I was in Greek heaven! Think of this place as a hole in the wall Greek restaurant meets Chipotle style serving. 

The ambiance leaves a lot to be desired and the signage was a bit confusing - something I really pay attention to being in the design industry. Yet all that being said, great food and friendly service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Looking for Mediterranean in Tempe and stumbled onto Hummus Express. Who needs ambience when the food is this great. Excellent vegetarian and meat choices to please any palate. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hummus Xpress catered a friends birthday party and w/in two days, we are on site. 

I am impressed by their build your own Mediterranean cuisine concept. The food is delicious, as if cooked fresh rather than under a hot plate on a line. 

The employees were really accommodating and satisfied our hungry and indecisive tummies.

And whoa nelly ... they aren't kidding when they say spicy ... My flavor buds are still salivating at the fresh flavors!

Now if only they had a location closer to Scottsdale (hint hint)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mediterranean food in Tempe, if not the valley!  Super flavorful and authentic. Plus the employees are very friendly and helpful. The eggplant and falafel are my favorite things there. All of the hummus is delicious. So many options to choose from!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. Great selection of hummus. Nice workers, good atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place is pretty / really good. Like others reviewed it, it is like a healthier Chipolet without the upcharge on everything plus you leaving with felling of a healthy-full. 
Customer service is outstanding. I wasn't aware of a couple of item choices and they helped me out with tasters and recommendations. Money-wise, best bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend are avid hummus fans and have thus made it our mission to try hummus at every restaurant we can. This place is freaking amazing. Everything is delicious and full of flavor. 

Now, this place definitely has some inefficiency issues, especially when it comes to making the pita. There point of sale system is also kind of slow (and I have my suspicious about the staff).  This can be upsetting when getting to-go orders as it effects the temperature of the food. But this is my only complaint and will certainly not keep me from coming here. 

Their set up is that of a chipotle style, they press the pita at the beginning (or at least that is the intention, if you get something with pita on the side, they wait until the end which slows down the process) and you pick your sides, meat, hummus and toppings. Everything ends up being kinda mixed together but is still good. I even liked the rice, which I don't typically like but I'm having suspicions that I just inherently like Mediterranean style rice. 

*Gyro meat- great
Falafel - pretty good 
*potatoes - fantastic
*Jalapeno/Cilantro hummus - amazeballs, very spicy
*Classic hummus - Great ( I like it topped with onion, pickles and tomatoes)
Rice - delicious
Lemon-garlic hummus - a little spicy but pretty good
chipotle hummus- pretty good
*chili .. something sauce - spicy and delicious

{"text":"I love this place! It can seem overwhelming the first time since they offer so many choices, but they are so nice and incredibly helpful that they make it super-easy. Everyone that I've taken there has loved it. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Large portions and very fresh and flavorful.
I had a plate consisting of chicken, lamb, hummus, and several veggies and sauces.  
They have a large selection of humus and yummy dishes. Several are quite spicy so be careful.
 If I lived here I would be a regular. I just ate and I want to go back for more. Would make a great take out too."}
{"text":"I worked in Tempe for years and finally someone introduced me to Hummus Express.  Tons of options and food for the price.  I have brought 5 people there for the first time and they raved about it to their friends.  It is a Mediterranean version of Chipotle with more and better options"}
{"text":"This is excellent quality Mediterranean food. I love the chipotle style ordering system and the people that work there are very nice. Meat wise the chicken and the beef are both excellent. All of the hummus choices are yummy but be mindful that the jalapeño hummus is really hot. Great food. Great service. The only thing I didn't love was the tabboleh. But it's not biggy because there is plenty to goose from."}
{"text":"Just went here for dinner, I don't think you can go wrong with any of the options. The gyro meat is excellent and the vegetables are great. I really enjoyed the tabouleh! Get the baklava. Perfect right after filling up."}
{"text":"It was okay, I got a chicken bowl w/ rice and various vegges and toppings. Everything seemed kind of old, like it was sitting out for a while. The flavors were nothing amazing. Not exactly sure how this place has 4.5 stars.."}
{"text":"It's so easy to eat healthy when food tastes so good!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place, and for sure won't be the last time. It was awesome! The service was awesome after telling the person who served us that this was our first. He explained in detail and let us try some samples before we bought. This place will be on our radar from now on when choosing a place to eat."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Lots of vegan options!!! Fresh and so flavorful. The employees are really nice too. Can't wait to come back. Great for a quick and healthy meal."}
{"text":"Oh yeah this place is  legit food is so bomb staff is very nice and friendly definitely worth the five stars ."}
{"text":"Very peppy and polite servers! The food was GREAT. So full of flavor and fresh. I already can't wait till my next meal from Hummus Express!"}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot in Tempe! Delicious food, friendly staff, and did I mention the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"So far the best middle eastern food I've had in Arizona. It was easy to order and you get lots of good food for the money. I'm planning to be a regular at this place."}
{"text":"The best Greek food in Tempe! My boyfriend and I love this place. I always get the bowl with kale-onion salad, lemon pepper broccoli, garlic herb potatoes, chicken and the cilantro jalepeno hummus. I recommend this place to anyone who likes a fast & healthy meal or to anyone who likes Greek food! Staff is so nice and always seems like they're having fun, makes for a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"** Updating because sometimes technology sucks **

Don't take my word for it, go try it for yourself.  The Chipotle of Mediterranean food indeed.
So good.  Chicken/rice/tabouli/veggies/hummus/feta/olives/cucumbers MMMMM.  |

I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat for lunch - I have an honest belief it will be the 'Chipotle' of fantastically delicious, reasonably priced, Mediterranean/Middle-East inspired cuisine within the next 5 to 10 years!  Everything tastes super fresh (try the garlic aioli!!), is incredibly filling (portions are spot-on), and did I mention it's easily less than $9 a person???  Make sure you tip well!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this new lunch spot!!  My first time there I ate in, not realizing the sheer volume of food I would receive.  I ate the 1/3 I could cram into my stomach and then on a whim drove 20 miles to deliver the rest of my delectable pita lunch to my flavor-loving man! I stayed while he ate and all was quiet except for frequent appreciative sighs ;).  That says it all!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome concept! Tons of vegetarian and vegan options (all labeled such) for building a plate, pita sandwich or bowl.  Way too many things to list, but I chose a bowl with rice, 1 veggie, 1 hummus, and falafal served with a side of pita. 

Owner is great if you're a first timer walking you through the options and makes great suggestions. Highly recommend for lunch or dinner - seriously - GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Yeah 5 stars.       The staff is beyond friendly and the bold flavors are a big refreshing change from the typical sandwich lunch.     

Their menu confused me a little,  it works right-to-left because their serving counter works right-to-left and I wasn't quite sure how to order..   next time will be easier now that I know how it works. 

Good for vegans and meat eaters,  they have plenty for both."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great.  I was thinking about Hummus Express earlier today because I plan on going tonight and I gleaked.  My mouth began water so much that I sprayed my disgusting spit all over the place like a dilophosaurus.

Dude, try the beet hummus.  It's pink and looks awful and weird but it's amazing.  Their falafel is pretty damn solid.  

I just love it, man.  I love the way it's set up.  I want more people to come and to support this awesome place."}
{"text":"My Friend told me about it and I visited Hummus Xpress along with her. My God Food is yummy. It has it's taste not bland at all. So I bought Hummus with fill ins i.e $3.99 and .67 on extra filling. So to plan on a budget of $5.50 I bought Hummus (Beet Flavor Hummus) with Saffron Rice, Eggplant, Olives, Feta Cheese. \"What a healthy meal Ahh\" .Food is delicious, fresh, higher quality food in good price. Totally worth it. If you are lucky you will receive nice greetings from Amad. His service is excellent and you will want to revisit for sure. I got the same food for \"To Go\" And sensible girl i.e Precious. is good and very nice too. I was taken away with Amad's service. 
The $3.99 Deal is as follows: Pick 1 in each for any extra I think it is $ 0.67 more.
1.Types of Hummus : Beet Hummus, Classic Hummus,Chipotle Hummus, Basil Parsley Hummus, Arugla Hummus, Jalapeño Hummus, Ginger Hummus
2.Types of Fillings : Saffron Rice, Beans, Eggplant, Tofu, Carrots, Meats etc
3.Types of Salad: Tabouli Salad, Kale Salad, Kale with Wheat Salad
4.Types Of Salad( Single):  Tomatoes, Olives, Beetroots, Cucumbers, Jalapeños , Bell peppers, Spring onion green leaf rounds
5.Other Filling Types: Feta Cheese, and there were 4 More 
And you get Free Pita (Wheat/White) Bread along with Hummus with Fillings. What more can you ask for ?

Overall very delicious and authentic food with excellent service.  Supper !!!
We went at 2:15 afternoon.Wasn't much busy But on earlier visit was really really full house Usually 11 till 2 very busy. Not sure about evening as of now. Try and relish food. I am sure you will love the food."}
{"text":"The only problem I have is that there aren't more locations.  Stumbled across this place during my work lunch break... Holy wow.  Pick a style, pick a meat, pick a veggie, pick a salad/bean, pick your hummus, pick your toppings, pick your sauce"}
{"text":"Excellent Fast/Casual Middle Eastern Style Food featuring a variety of unique Hummus and many interesting toppings. 

It is a little confusing on how to order and is easier to understand when you read the website. The Main Menu is $6.45-$9.95. 

Your best option for sampling the most amount of offerings is \"the plate\" so I went for that. I walked in front of the glass front buffet and the helpful people behind the glass served. 

When you get \"The Plate\" They start with a really delicious Rice. You get TWO Protein Options. I went for the Flavorful Moist Brisket and the Lebanese Falafels. Since I got the brisket the Chef recommended a little Beef sauce over my rice and it was a really great suggestion. Then I got TWO vegetables Sides, yummy spicy carrots and crisp lemon broccoli. Next came Hummus and you either get one king or they split it and you get two. With all the flavors they offer I suggest getting two as I had the Beet root Hummus and the Original. You then get a salad choice and I picked Tabbouleh.

Believe it or not your not done yet.

Next are a large variety of pans of all kinds of vegetables and condiments and sauces and you pick whatever you like and get a pita too.

I picked Pickled Beets and some kind of Onion dish and really delicious Schug Sauce.

Now I'm at the end of the line and pay. Get my Cup for beverage and seat myself.

Everything was so delicious. I never had a Lebanese Style Falafel before and it seemed very different but also very good. The beef I tried was moist and flavorful and not too fatty. The rice was really, Really Good. I thought the carrots were super yummy. The pickled beets were almost crunchy with a really interesting flavor. Of course the Hummus was very good and that Schug Sauce was very aromatic and delicious. The shrug sauce had some kick to it but is a milder more herbal version of others I've tasted before but was certainly just as delicious.

Very Above Average Middle Eastern Style Food in a very casual and quick atmosphere. 

4.5 Stars

P.S. No I wasn't able to finish my plate and took 1/2 home for latter."}
{"text":"Food was very good but wish they would put bigger scoops in  the plates, they we're stingy with it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Hummus Xpress. Hands down one of the best Mediterranean restaurants in Tempe! I eat here probably once a week and always order their bowls.The braised beef is amazing, but if I'm not feeling meat, there are also a lot of delicious vegetables to add in place of it. Always a great selection of hummus as well! For about the same price as Chipotle, you get way more choices and they don't skimp on your fillings. I would recommend this place to anyone who has a taste for Mediterranean food. Be careful though, you'll get addicted!"}
{"text":"I've now visited hummus xpress two times, and both have been amazing! I consider myself a lover of Greek/Mediterranean/Persian food, and this place is a fresh twist on the usual vibe in these types of restaurants. ALL of the food I've tried so far is super fresh, and the hummus choices are amazing!!  The staff has been super friendly and on point both times I've visited. We are even thinking about having them cater our wedding! 

A must try."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. It offers amazing and authentic food at an affordable price. If you like Mediterranean then hummus express is a must. Everything is always fresh and packs a punch. I have high hopes for this business. It has great potential."}
{"text":"UPDATE!

The guys at Hummus Xpress took my criticism of their falafel seriously.  The chef/owner remade the classic falafel into something awesome and unique.  It's now more moist, flavorful, light, and fresh.  It's truly excellent!

And I'd like to highlight their roasted, caramelized eggplant and unique pomegranate baba ganoush.

Hummus Xpress is a phenomenal Middle Eastern dining experience!"}
{"text":"A compact lunch spot that packs a punch!

I love this place, especially their hot veggies and protein.  I normally place an order for a bowl.  Once you decide on a protein, you fill it with a veggie (I love the eggplant), pick a hummus flavor (they have 4 to choose from) and a salad.  I usually end up ordering extra veggies and you'll pay extra for it.  Top it off with a sauce and you'll see your bowl filled up pretty quickly.  Very filling and yes, you will walk out with dragon breath but it's totally worth it.  Just make sure to pack some gum or mints.  For dessert, they offer baklava and cookies.  You'll walk out thinking why you didn't come sooner.  

The place gets pretty busy at lunch but the line moves quickly so don't despair.  Parking is tight but totally worth it.  If the place runs out of seating, they will conveniently pack it to take back to work.  Go, what are you waiting for...GO!"}
{"text":"Best food in Tempe!  Gyro is mouthwatering. Tziki sauce outrageous.  So different and healthy.  Yum!  Flavor festival."}
{"text":"This was my first time going here. Being stuck at a hotel all week long I wanted to try something different. I basically found this thru Yelp and the reason I went was because of the good reviews they had. 
Service: The guys there were really friendly and guided me thru the choosing process.
Food: It was great, I had the small bowl but it was enough to fill me up. Chicken had a good flavor, rice was delicious. Every bite that I took was full of flavor. If u like Spicy food the Jalapeño hummus is delicious. Lentils and garbanzos were good as well as the brocoli.
Price: affordable I only paid $8.71 for the small bowl
Cons: didnt really like the garlic sauce but then again not a big fan of garlic. The sweet tea looked old. (Only reasons I gave it a 4 star, I really wanted to get my free house brewed tea offered by Yelp). 

Food is delicious I would go back."}
{"text":"I have not been in for a little while but while I use to live by it I would go in once in a while.  For around $10 you can get a lot of food!  The variety is awesome and you get to pick quite a bit of it for your bowl (if you are a type of person that does not like different foods touching each other, I would not recommend it)  I love how many different flavors of hummus they have available as well and I like most of them.  Eddie I believe one of the owners is a really friendly guy and helps you make decisions and let's you try out whatever you want. I'm definitely due in for a lunch at Hummus Xpress in the very near future and I hope you get to go try it too."}
{"text":"First time here and it was pretty good. A lot of food. I got a \"bowl\" and will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  If you want to treat your taste buds this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The quality of food here is about as good as it gets for quick dining. This is Chipotle-style for Mediterranean food. There are many options, so I recommend reviewing the website before going in, because the staff expects you to move along quickly.

I ordered a bowl with rice, gyro meat, fried eggplant, potatoes, jalapeño hummus, tabouli salad, cucumber, tomatoes and Tzatziki sauce. It sounds like an unusual mix, but it works, and the portions are good for the price. I was happy with everything in my bowl. My brother recommended trying the chicken and chipotle hummus the next time we eat there. 

There is not much seating inside the restaurant, so you may have to order to-go during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean restaurants in Tempe. The regular plate portions are big so if you're ordering lunch I would recommend ordering the bowl unless you don't mind saving your leftovers for later.

They have a lot of healthy options for add ons and their baklavas (dessert) are delicious. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I had their bowl with beef, fried eggplant, saffron rice, classic hummus, and the kale salad.  I work close-by and plan on bringing my co-workers in.  This is definitely on the regular lunch spot rotation.  The peach-lavender tea was also lovely. Everything was very fresh.  Try it out! You won't be disappointed! 
:)"}
{"text":"I have been here about 10 times over the last 6 months.  I love it because its fresh, healthy, and so tasty.  I now order a salad instead of a bowl b/c both come with a pita and i don't need to extra carbs.  With so many toppings and fillings, the salad is amazing.  I often pay for extra veggies b/c they are so yummy."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I went back to back days and brought a friend back the next day.  It's Mediterranean food with like a chipotle service model.  Think pita jungle (with actually killer authentic Mediterranean) and chipotles love child.  Prices are normal for lunch I'd say it's going to run about $10 with a drink.  The hummus is awesome though.  The jalepeño cilantro is amazing.  Love love love it"}
{"text":"This is a really cool concept, and a very good value for the quantity and quality of food you get."}
{"text":"My first time at Hummus Xpress was less than a month ago. I stopped in about 30 minutes before close. The wide-eyed look of confusion on my face alerted the employees that I was a newbie. Even though it was almost closing time they were super nice. 

The employees kindly explained the whole process: the difference between sizes (bowl or plate), fillings (various hot veggies, hummus, and salads) toppings, and prices ($0.65 for additional fillings). They gave me a bunch of samples to help my indecision. Thankfully the store was pretty empty - I wouldn't suggest doing this during the lunchtime rush. There really are so many options to choose from spicy to sweet, savory, meaty or just veggies - it is totally customizable! 

So I got ALL the things!! ... er, pretty close to All THE THINGS! 

My favorites being the rice, the fried eggplant, and the lemon ginger hummus (though all the hummus has been delicious). I've been back a few times now since that first visit and each time I've ate the whole bowl in one sitting! Yup, it just that good."}
{"text":"Bold flavors, super fresh ingredients, and VERY friendly employees. This place is like Chipotle for Mediterranean food, without the chain restaurant feel. We stopped here after arriving at PHX and picking up our rental car at the Enterprise right down the street. We were totally starving and Yelp saved the day! We must have looked a little lost when we walked in because an employee immediately offered to walk us through the process. I ordered a bowl with saffron rice, gyro meat, roasted red pepper hummus, lentils, and lots of fresh veggies. It was absolutely delicious. And there was a check-in offer for one of their fresh brewed teas - score! All in all, this place deserves 5 stars. I would seriously eat at Hummus Xpress multiple times a week if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Chipotle...um I mean Hummus Xpress.  Actually, the only reference to Chipotle is so that you understand how the ordering is done. (Because who hasn't been to a chipotle right). You start and can order a bowl, giro, or salad and then you get to make all of your wonderful selection.  

This was yummy yummy in my tummy.  Just remember to go easy on all the sauce options if your are trying to stay healthy which by the way, you can totally do here if you would like."}
{"text":"Coming from the taboolie mooley. I can say it's good az food. Take your photo here ginger lemon hummus. Staff is very informative and inspired."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, portions big, pita however was cold and hard but Hummus is definitely work checking out!"}
{"text":"All of the food here is amazing and the service is outstanding - I would certainly recommend this place to anyone looking for really good Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today with my room mate. I insisted on Burger King, and thank goodness we didn't go there! This place is authentic, tasty, cheap and filling. I'm currently rolling around in bed making whale noises because I cannot believe how much middle eastern food I just consumed. I will definitely recommend and tell all my middle eastern cuisine loving college student friends that this is the spot!!"}
{"text":"OMG this place killed it.. outstanding grub.. unique concept and flavor bombs that tantalize the taste buds. . Oh and super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Their name makes them sound like a cheesy franchise, but Hummus Xpress is anything but.

Home cooked. Delicious. Fresh. Healthy. Great quick service.

Couldn't ask for more, except maybe for the falafel to be a bit tastier.

I get the chicken plate with rice, broccoli, potatoes, hummus, olives, feta and lentil and kale salad. A meal like that will cost you a little bit more than ten bucks, but is well worth it.

Pretty hip atmosphere with chipotle-style food serving.

They've got a few talented local musicians who play jazz guitar every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Awesome Tempe find! Fast, fresh, and delicious. We both had the bowl. Plenty of food and we both enjoyed. Build your own type of place, just like chipotle. Friendly workers too!"}
{"text":"After we're welconed by a very friendly host we were served two tasty bowls with gyro meat.  I ventured through all the toppings and tried every single one :) So fresh and healthy I would highly recommend this place for heath focused foodies :)"}
{"text":"I am hoping I just caught this place on a bad night...

After reading all the great reviews on this place and only living .6 miles away, we opted for takeout. I went in and if I were just giving stars for the staff and customer service I would give it 5 hands down. They were not only super helpful, but very friendly and enjoyable. 

The food... It looked good, and they way they described it was enticing, but my boyfriend and I did not like it. It is just like a Chipotle for Greek food, and very quick. Although, maybe since we eat at places that cook our food to order, we are just spoiled. Most of our food was cold, the chicken and potatoes and like I said I live less than 5 minutes away, so it wasn't he time between the restaurant and home. We did warm it in the microwave, but I ended up eating the tasty (and only hot item) wheat pita and tossing the rest. 

So, as I said earlier I am hoping this was an off night, and from my experience I wouldn't recommend, but maybe we will try again another night."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean joint in Tempe, hands down! Eddie, the owner, is a master of the art, and his expertise shines at Hummus Xpress! 

The atmosphere here is comfortable and inviting. Live music, plenty of customers (but not too many), and some of the most friendly employees I've experienced. And the food is FANTASTIC! Eddie crafted an exquisite dish, with jalapeno hummus, lamb, lentil, and poached mushrooms. It was a remarkably delicious dish for only $8.50! 

Hummus Xpress is bound to take over Phoenix. This restaurant has everything you want in the perfect Mediterranean lunch spot."}
{"text":"We happened on this place by accident the other day. We were waiting for our car to be done at the mechanic so we wandered down Broadway, saw this place and decided to grab some food... Best accident ever! 

We were greeted by a very friendly staff, who explained how it all worked. Basically, they're a self-proclaimed Mediterranean Chipotle, but SO MUCH BETTER! 

You have a choice of a pita, a bowl or a plate. We chose a plate, and opted to share it, and it was more than enough food! You get saffron rice, and then choose your veggie (we went with grilled zucchini and kale), and your protein (chicken, falafel, gyro, beef), we chose gyro. Then you move down and pick your hummus, they usually have 3 or 4 different flavours (we went with cilantro jalapeno), and salad (we got tabouleh). But wait! You're not done yet! Then you pick your \"accessories\": diced onions, pickles, olives, lettuce, tomatoes, etc etc. All designed to compliment your meal. We went with diced onions, pickles and kalamata olives. 

Oh my goodness. This was seriously the best $11 I've ever spent at a restaurant. The gyros was tender and flavourful, the saffron rice was a great touch. The veggies weren't soggy. The cilantro jalapeno hummus had an amazing kick to it, and we thought it was better than most of the hummus you find at Trader Joes, AJ's, etc. The tabouleh was so bright and refreshing. The portion in the plate was perfect for the two of us to share. They didn't really skimp on anything. 

I was thoroughly impressed with the whole thing. The guys were super nice, the food was amazing and the price was more than right. 

The only downside which caused me to take away a star, was that there didn't seem to be a restroom. We thought it was a little odd, but then, we also didn't ask if there was restroom. But since there's usually a sign indicating where the potty is, and the only door led back to kitchen, it seemed safe to assume there was no where to go... if you needed to... you know... go. 

Other than that, I highly recommend Hummus Xpress!"}
{"text":"Love it here! Great for any occasion. Employees are very cool and nice people. Stop by sometime if you're looking for something healthy."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Great food, tons of flavor, and prices that don't break the bank.
I really love their eggplant... which sounds weird to say but it awesome, give it try!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh this place is so ridiculously delicious.  A co-worker introduced me to this place and now we eat here about once a week, it's so good that we need a weekly fix.  The ordering set up is just like Chipotle, pick how you want it served then rice, meat, veggies, sauce - all the ingredients taste fresh and it's packed with spices and flavor.  I usually stick to a pita with gyro meat and load up on the nice selection of grilled veggies.  I've never had a bad experience here but we brought along another co-worker once and she hated the food and only took a few bites.  If you don't stray from typical American food you're probably not going to like this place."}
{"text":"Well, I've found my new go-to lunch spot for work. So many excellent things on the menu and everything is spiced to perfection. The staff is very kind and patient to people who have no idea what they want, or have never been there before-- even during lunch rush! So glad I checked this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best humus and vegetables around! My new favorite place! Clean, awesome staff friendly and great music to listen too while you munch"}
{"text":"Drove by this place & made a note to check it out.  Stopped to see what everyone on Yelp thought and that sealed the deal.  

So many options, endless combinations, and a very friendly staff.  The food was delicious and I will definitely be heading back to sample some more.  What a bargain.  I opted for the \"plate\" which comes with 2 proteins, 2 veggies, 1 salad, toppers, and a sauce, oh! and hummus.  I wound up with chicken, beef, roasted veggies, the kale, chopped salad, hummus, olives, pickles, pita, garlic aioli, and a pita for under $10!"}
{"text":"This place is AH-MAZING! I've had multiple bowls there. Everything is divine and I love that you are able to make it to order right on site. Anytime that I'm in the area I can't pass this place up. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"This place just created a TASTE-GASM on my tongue !

Best Mediterranean place around Tempe give this place a go !"}
{"text":"I like this place, the food is fresh and authentic. Prices are good too think of it like a Mediterranean Chipotle style place. I always get the pita and have it topped with whatever I am feeling for lunch that day. Check it out if your'e in the neighborhood you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I had lunch at Hummus Xpress for the first time today and I will be back for more.

I had a \"bowl\" and filled it with rice pilaf, gyro meat, ginger glazed carrots, jalapeno cilantro hummus, lentil kale salad and chose the whole wheat pita.  There are lot's of combinations to choose from and I will what to give them all a try.

Don't be put off by the neighborhood, it's industrial and little dated.  The food is great, the service is great, and it's easy find and to get to.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent service Excellent food you won't be disappointed!!!!!!!!  I love this place every time I visit, friend staff and good food!!!"}
{"text":"I'll take any excuse to trek down to Tempe just so I can eat here! They have plenty of options for everybody and their ingredients are always the freshest fresh. Been here countless times and still crave it! The jalapeño cilantro hummus is awesome!"}
{"text":"The Chipotle of the Mediterranean. Fresh, flavorful and fast. The tea tasted like it was actually brewed in the back, not from a mix. I hadn't ever been here before, but if I lived or worked in this area I'd be a regular.

The menu was a bit confusing but essentially you choose a meat, rice, hummus and other toppings. The Yelp check in bonus was a free iced tea. The serving sizes were generous enough that I couldn't finish it all for lunch, and all of the flavors went together really well. Plenty of vegetarian and low carb options since you could trade something out for the meat or rice portions of the dish.

Staff was friendly and helpful even with a busy lunchtime crowd. I needed sugar for my tea since there wasn't any at the beverage station and someone ran into the back to get me some. Unfortunately, he came back with salt, which I dumped in and then nearly gagged at. Second time was the charm though, and the tea was great."}
{"text":"Never been here before, but friends picked it. Not really my type of food. The employees were extremely helpful and the food was awesome. I ate off their recommendation based of what I said I typically like so I don't remember exactly what it was. I just know I want it again."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place on yelp, saw the amazing reviews and decided I had to give-er-a-go.  The ordering process is a little confusing but the employees are very helpful. I believe the owner  made my bowl of awesome, and he was very cheery.  I was a little hesitant on how I would like the food because all of the ingredients were pretty much piled on each other, but I was very surprised that all the flavors mixed perfectly together.  I ordered the bowl and had gyro, saffron rice, roasted potatoes, onions, tomatoes, green onions, chipotle hummus, lentil salad, garbanzo beans, feta cheese and just a touch of tahini sauce.  I was starting to feel a little full halfway through the bowl, but the food was so great that I couldn't put it down.  I'll definitely be back and I'm really excited that there is finally a good restaurant in that strip mall!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is incredible, its so fresh and delicious. I work nearby and visit frequently. Vegetarians and meat eaters will love this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious! There was such a flavor explosion! The guys working were very friendly and helpful in my decisions. I had the red pepper and the cilantro jalapeño hummus with plenty of vegetables, and more. Recommend this place for sure!!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food on the planet! Falafel is perfect and the variety of options are endless. Love that there are always new flavors of hummus. Sad that the only location is in Tempe and hope that one day they can expand! (Come to the west side!!!!)"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there and I was really excited about having a new lunch option....then I went to the bathroom and a cook came out and did not wash his hands...I will not be returning."}
{"text":"One the best lunch hangouts! Relatively inexpensive, great tasting meditterean cuisine. Fast and friendly service. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Nice large Greek style plates. The meats are well cooked with good seasoning and flavor. The pita isn't the best, so no need to ger more on the side. The side salad is worth the price and a good substitute if your going low calorie. The price is amazing for the amount of food you get. Unfortunately, i keep comparing it to Greek food in NYC, and it doesn't hold its own. Hence the 4 stars.
Use ubereats, and have it delivered right to your place. It's a great dinner for one of those at home Netflix nights. If you want $10 off your order use my code eats-mbdvx."}
{"text":"Pros:

- Good healthy food. 
- Lots of vegetarian and Non Veg selection.
- Friendly Staff

Cons:
- Confusing menu. Needs to be more clear about how many of what you can get from each section. My girl got 2 and I got 1 but we paid the same. Also they need more seasoning in the chicken. No salt whatsoever.

- One spoon of meat? Really for $7-$9 you give one spoon of meat? First time i went in there i got 2 spoons. There need to be consistency with meat portions. I feel like I'm getting robbed depending on whoever is working at that moment gives you the portion he thinks is appropriate for you.

-I dont know how long this place has been open for but they definitely need to clean this place up. The booths are ripped and dirty, should be aligned with the wall instead of having it in the center. There was dirt all over the floor along with a screw on the floor where we were sitting.

- There was this loud vibrating sound coming from the soda machine all this time we were there. Very annoying. Fix it guys.

All in all its a group of young guys running this place including the owner and seems like they are on the right track with their friendly service and healthy food. Just clean it up a little bit and you have  my 5 stars."}
{"text":"Yum! They really have some very flavorful food, I loved the rice and hummus and the chicken was seasoned and cooked so well, the falafel was my fav.  I worry about food temps, I felt a little queezy a little while after eating, but it passed very fast, and it may not have had anything to do with the meal, but I automatically thought it could have because of how the food appeared...  I won't shy away from trying again if I am in the area..."}
{"text":"Outstanding like always and the grilled chicken pita bowl was just as good as the other meats I have tried !"}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon on our way up to Flagstaff. Looking for something fast that wasn't fast food, and this was a hit! We were immediately greeted and served (in and out within about 5 minutes). I ordered the most delicious falafel bowl with rice, white bean salad, glazed carrots, onions, jalapeño and cilantro hummus, feta, and garlic aioli with a wheat pita. Holy flavor, Batman. Pro tip: you can get half and half of two different hummus types if you are indecisive like me. My fiancé ordered a gyro on a pita with potatoes and tzatziki, which he happily devoured. It is not the easiest thing to eat while driving (we ended up just pulling over - it was that good) but it was a great way to kick off our road trip. If I was a local, you couldn't keep me away from this place. Can't wait to pass through Tempe again just to be able to come back!!"}
{"text":"I've been going here regularly for a year now and the standard is always 5 star. Eddie the boss treats his customers extremely well and I am always made to feel welcome. 

Not only that though, the food is gorgeous. The gyro is the best I have tasted and the cilantro jalapeño hummus is legendary. Big selection of healthy vegetables and tabouli saves any guilt. They also give you generous portions so it can be split over the day.

Always in my top places to stop by when I am on the move. Best pita place out here. Can't be compared."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place a couple weeks ago. Delicious food, portions are generous, staff is friendly! Everything that I've tried so far has been really good, I really like the eggplant! My wife liked it a lot too, I think this will be a new regular for us!"}
{"text":"So I gave this place a try just because of the amazing Yelp reviews and I have to say it did not disappoint! I was on the road and between accounts so I ordered it to go. I actually got out of my car and went back inside to compliment them on the food and thank them for their amazing customer service. 
Great experience. I will be back next time in in the area!"}
{"text":"I eat here a few times a month and the quality of their food is always consistently great.   I always get a plate, sometimes it is almost two meals depending on how hungry I am.  Totally recommend going, except on the lunches when I am in a hurry and don't want to wait in line.    ha. =)"}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**

This place is a Mediterranean version of Chipotle! There are so many flavors and options to choose from that I was overwhelmed! I went based off the team's recommendations and didn't regret any option. The eggplant was my favorite. The hummus is made fresh and you can taste the difference compared to store bought brands. Each bowl comes with a pita on the side for free!

TIP: Can't pick which hummus to add? You can do half and half for no charge!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious I came here for the first time today and everyone was really helpful in choosing what was good. The food itself is fresh"}
{"text":"I go here pretty regularly (wish it was a tad closer - I would live there).  I love the plate option it is very generous and reasonably priced.  I share it with my daughter and still have some to bring home.  However, this last time I found the perfect combo for me.  Hummus bowl (classic is still my favorite) with the beef (both out of this world) and a side of tabouli.  I am so happy they changed their tabouli to the traditional bulgur wheat.  A fantastic and healthy lunch for $6 (w/o drink).

Gyro meat is good too and all the add-ons make it a perfect fit for your taste buds.  The garlic aioli is a must try.

Made my self hungry - guess I know where I'm going for lunch."}
{"text":"Dare I say this is the best Mediterranean food I've ever head? 

Just kidding, I haven't eaten in hours and I'm starving. Real talk: the food here is dope and prices are great. Tons of awesome and flavorful hummuses and sauces, fresh ingredients, and very friendly servers.

Come here for a satisfying, cheap and casual meal! 

DC people who find their way here - it's like an even better version of Cava."}
{"text":"This place is different in that it brings a quick \"build your own\" bowl approach to Mediterranean food.  That part I like, and what really blew my mind was how well they pulled it off.  The place is casual, rather small and they have a very simple and straight forward approach to offering a myriad of ingredients (all of which are exceptional... at least the ones I've tried.)  I found this place because they've catered a few lunches at my office and always were delicious, so I finally went there on my own today and it was quite good.  If you like garlic, hummus, really delicious gyro meat, lots of tasty and uniquely prepared veggies and sauces served up in an authentic, fast friendly yet not chainy at all way, I would say it's worth a try.  I drove from Warner and Hardy all the way up there for lunch and it will be the first of many trips."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for almost two years. Absolutely the best! Tons of vegetarian options where you dont feel screwed by being a vegetarian!!"}
{"text":"Great place! So many combinations of veggies, hummus, salads and sauces that my daughter and I can't wait to go back. She is vegan and there are so many options for her. We both had bowls with rice, eggplant, falafel, garlic hummus and the bean salad. We customized our veggies to our liking and we both had a delicious, very affordable, meal! Yum!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, the prices are low, and the staff is super friendly.  This is my favorite lunch spot bar none!"}
{"text":"It's a small place, with great customer service and most importantly really great tasting food. Can't beat it for a casual and quick bite to eat at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I actually stumbled upon this place by chance.  I was looking for a place to grab a quick bite in between sessions of my daughter's swim championships.  I was going to go to the juice bar next door but it turned out to be a diet/nutrition place with a membership requirement, so I started talking to Eddie at Hummus Xpress.  He was so incredibly personable and accommodating that I had to give his restaurant a shot.  Everything smelled amazing so it made it an easier decision.

First, let me reiterate....Eddie, the owner, is forthright, honest, and incredibly nice.  As previously mentioned, the concept is like a Mediterranean Chipotle with the difference being this is locally owned and sourced food with lots of organic, vegan friendly, and fresh food.  You pick your choice of bowl, plate, or pita and then add main meat or vegetable component, added toppings such as hummus(6 kinds made fresh daily), tabouli, etc.  From there, you pick topping of sauces, hot sauces, olives, tzatziki amd more.  

Eddie will let you sample whatever you would like.  The gyro mean is so tasty but I rolled with the slow roasted braised beef.  All I can say is you must try this place, whether or not you are in the area.  It will be well worth your time."}
{"text":"First time visiting and everyone was very friendly. One employee walked me through each of the options and let me try everything before. I definitely recommend this place for lunch in Tempe!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and each time the food has been phenomenal.  I preferred the chipotle hummus over the super popular cilantro jalapeno.   The lemon broccoli is probably the best broccoli I have ever had.  The tahini and garlic aoli sauces were divine.  I didn't particularly care for the recommended potato salad today but only because it was a flavor I'm not fond of, the quality and freshness was all there.  

One complaint.  At the expense of sounding like an old fuddy duddy...while I was there for lunch they were blasting disco music so loud I could not hear the guy taking my order or have a decent conversation with my husband.  It was fine for a bar atmosphere but too loud for a Monday lunch date.  

However, this will definitely be my weekly lunch spot for a while."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time. 
Great Food. Great service.
You can custom design your meal, which I love.
The staff is knowledgeable, friendly and you can tell that they take pride in their work.
I will be back and I will also send others here, especially vegans and vegetarians!
Thank you for providing a much needed service to all. Good, fresh food!"}
{"text":"It's like a salad bar of Mediterranean food. I got a bowl with rice and several different kinds of veggies, hummus, and lots of free little extras like olives. The owner was very friendly and it was super fast. My bowl came with a pita and it was super filling, meat-free, and spicy just like I like it! I resisted the baklava but I gave in to lavender iced tea. For the price it's a steal and there were two young guys playing nice soft live music. I am a huge fan and can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, simple setup, I love this place!

I discovered this place based on Yelp reviews less than 2 weeks ago, and I've already made it there a total of 3 times. This place is that good! Although I don't really care for the comparison to Chipotle in any way, they themselves describe themselves as being like Chipotle in that you get up in the line and pick out items along the way (i.e., meat, salad, veggies, etc.). There are enough choices here that the variety is practically endless.

So far, I've gotten the bowl 3 times. I've had chicken every time (I'll change that at some point). I've tried the broccoli, carrots (fantastic!), and kale--all are good. I've tried 3 of the types of hummus--cilantro jalapeno, red pepper, and one other that I can't remember right now--again, they're all excellent, and I look forward to trying the other 3. There is a variety of veggies you can put on top. Everything is fresh, and the jalapenos are always spicy. There are 5 different sauces, and the ones I've tried so far are delicious. Finally, the bowl comes with rice and a pita (white or wheat) if you so choose.

There are also pita, salad, and plate options, but the bowl has worked out so well so far that I haven't felt the need to try anything else. Along with one of the empanadas they've had available (spinach or cheese), I've had plenty of food every time I've gone.

This place really is great. I'll be a regular here."}
{"text":"Everything we had here was delicious!! As their name states, hummus is their specialty! All the flavors were delicious and we hear they switch out the flavors every so often so we will have to visit Arizona again to try out the others. The roasted eggplant was amazing and my boyfriend will vouch for the garlic herb potatoes. Our review is limited to what we tried but we both enjoyed the gyro meat as well. The staff there is hilarious and next time I'm letting them choose my plate, because all their selections were spot-on. A well-deserved 5 star for the food, people and local environment."}
{"text":"Hummus Xpress, welcome back. I've missed you. After my gripe about the salad incident, the owner made sure that things were figured out, can't knock that level of dedication to the customer. I want to be clear here, I had frequented the heck out of this place prior to that confusion. I had even gotten my coworkers hooked on it as well. I missed this place, and I am truly glad that all is back. 

This place does make good, quick, and relatively healthy food. I could, and some weeks have,  eat the eggplant in excess. It's just so good. The falafel is delicious, and has the right consistency. Sometimes falafel gets dry, or too mushy; it's a tricky thing to tame for those that are comfortable with it. HX gets it right. Not a fan of the mighty chickpea? Try some of the Aleppo Beef. It is juicy and tender, and mixes with most of the other options. Their tabbouleh is also prime. It's the best tabbouleh I've had that wasn't homemade. Finally, it is really rare for me to find good schug in Tempe. It seems like most restaurants I visit stick to the standard spicy sauces that are essentially cayenne and vinegar. Schug is a flavorful addition to the condiment family. It packs a good punch though, so take warning. I pair it with the jalapeno hummus, but that is definitely not for all. 

 
Welcome back to my regular consumption pattern. 
I've missed you."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch after Yelping local restaurants in his area. Very pleasantly surprised to find a nice little shop with friendly helpful staff that warmly greeted me as I walked in the door! They were very kind to offer taste samples and at the ready to help as soon as I was ready.

My friend had also not been there before so it was a nice treat to try someplace new and different for him too.

Everything we tried was very tasty and freshly made! The allspice hummus was delicious and I particularly liked my eggplant and roasted potatoes with chicken in a pita!

I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Their hummus truck was parked in front of my workplace. I had just come out of a very intense meeting where emotions had run high so it was a delight to see a refreshing food option curbside. The cook provided me a tasty sample with gyro meat, rice, and bean salad. I was instantly hooked. I ordered a pita with chicken, ginger carrots, bean salad, kale, feta, tomatoes, cilantro, onions, and tahini sauce. My taste buds danced in delight!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit here and I am obsessed already! Staff is incredibly friendly, there was live music on a Wednesday afternoon which was a nice touch. The process was explained to us (similar to chipotle style of ordering) and the combinations are endless. The ingredients are fresh as can be and the portions are perfect. I had a chicken bowl with the lentil kale salad and cilantro jalapeño hummus with a number of toppings. You get a free tea when you check in on here and I got the desert blossom black tea, delicious! I'm already looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"This was one of the few Mediterranean restaurants that actually tasted authentic and home made. I will be making my way back to this spot when I'm in this city. The veggie options are great and taste amazing. Two thumbs up to this restaurant."}
{"text":"some of the best food I've ever had.. it's chipotle but even more amazing.. kudos to hummus xpress you guys are awesome.. serioiusly, fantastic food.."}
{"text":"This place is so good for vegetarians on the go!  You get a lot of food for a decent price.  Whatever you get, you can customize it to make it exactly the way you want.  There's so many different veggies, sauces, hummuses, salad bases, etc.  It gets pretty damn busy around lunch time but the guys at the counter are super friendly and patient.  They always have really funny jokes, too.  The only thing is that every time I've gone here, every single thing I get is super spicy, even if it's not supposed to be.  I like spicy but sometimes I'm not in the mood.  Maybe I just got unlucky?  I'll definitely come back to find out, though!"}
{"text":"Place is the bomb, never had a bad experience, just only wish they were open later, hopefully this place never leaves Tempe"}
{"text":"Amazing...will be back with all my friends!   Extraordinary flavors!   Get the large bowl and have 3 meals for leftovers!  Gyro meat is the best...just plain awesome for the whole experience!   Great customer service tops it off!"}
{"text":"Yummy, fresh, fast Mediterranean . Generous portions and friendly staff. Definitely going to visit here often."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Incredible food great service! Everyone I travel to Phoenix for business I make sure to get my hummus express on!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant period. I go here when ever I can't decide what I want. It's chipotle style in creation of your bowl, but much better and very flavorful every single time. I always get extra veggies and I know I'm getting good clean food each time."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat but I wish they would be more generous with their taboule/sauce portions, shouldn't only give the choice for one sauce because that makes the food dry and needs more of the sauce. We shouldn't have to pay extra for each sauce. Where is the Tahini sauce? Tahini sauce would be the perfect addition!!"}
{"text":"I live right near this place and had been meaning to stop by; it is always a pleasure to see a new local business pop up. My fiance's Vegan sister was in town and we needed to get something quick and tasty after a long day. I took orders and left for my one block journey. When I arrived the two gentleman working greeted me with smiles and took some time to get to know me. Everything looked AMAZING! I told them I needed something vegan and Eddie took it upon himself to create a masterpiece of Mediterranean Vegan friendly meals. They let me sample anything I wanted and I ended up with a wonderful gyro bowl with caramelized egg plant, roasted potatoes, and so many other yummy things. I would give this place 5 stars for their customer service alone, but they have amazing food as well."}
{"text":"The veggie bowl is awesome.  You get to pick your toppings.  I always opt for easy rice, and lots
of eggplant, broccoli, and potatoes.  I love the selection of veggie toppings ranging from pickled veggies to kalamata olives to tabouli .  They usually have several different hummus flavors to pick from.  My personal favorites are the beet hummus, and the Jalapeño cilantro hummus.  And top it all off with a lil shug sauce, and you have yourself a fresh lunch with a lil kick of heat from the shug sauce."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is very delicious and the staff some of the most friendly and personal that I've ever met"}
{"text":"I love this place!  

They offer so many vegetarian combinations, but they have great meat choices too.  If you check in on yelp, you get a free iced tea, and it's amazing; not your typical iced tea.  

Pro's: 
Great selection of veggies
Line moves quickly
Several Spicy choices
Very friendly and helpful staff

Cons:
Parking can be tough
Small eating area, better to-go for large parties or busy hours

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for months, and finally tried it today. I grabbed takeout for lunch, I was in and out in under  five minutes. All the food is labeled clearly \"gluten free\" or \"vegan\" which was really cool. Everything tasted delicious and fresh, I really enjoyed my bowl( chicken, zucchini, jalapeño hummus, rice, lentil-kale salad, with bunch of different veggie toppings). Staff was friendly to me (and my daughter who was making faces at them the whole time lol) over all great experience, will be back soon."}
{"text":"I took my dog to the vet and I stopped by here because of the great review, best decision of my life. I've been looking for a place I can buy my hummus fresh! Their chicken was perfectly grilled, and I got two meats so the falafel was awesome too. This is the first establishment to have excellent garlic alioli sauce since I came back from Spain. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Really good middle eastern food \"fast\"
Good, quick and healthy 
Awesome place for lunch with a lot of flavors"}
{"text":"It was okay, nothing really amazing. I was craving Mediterranean food and found this place on Yelp. For the amount of food you get, the price is pretty good. I got the plate to share with my dad and it was huge. The pita was good. The rest was quite salty, with a kind of pickled taste to it? The people who were working were so nice though. They explained how everything worked because I was obviously clueless lol.

If you need a quick fix of Mediterranean food, come here. I've had better and am willing to wait for someone to cook my food and really enjoy it."}
{"text":"Mediterranean food that isn't only healthy and delicious but astonishingly affordable too. I would highly recommend this place for vegans/vegetarians on a budget."}
{"text":"Love the food at this place...it definitely gets busy during the weekday lunch rush so plan to wait 15+ minutes in line. They also have a tendency to put online orders ahead of customers waiting in line which I never quite understood. 

Overall, great food and nice employees just not the place  you should head if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"This place is INSANELY GOOD! Every item on the menu is tasty af. They have serious gluten free options as well as some vegan options. It's like a chipotle for Greek food X1000. So good. Hummus Xpress. Actually nearly fast food."}
{"text":"Very flavorful and huge portions to make even a guy with a big appetite full. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The concept of this restaurant is comparable to Chipotle. You pick pita, bowl or plate, then you pick what goes inside.
I was really confused at first becasue the order of the menu on the wall was from right to left and not left to right. I wonder why...
The gal behind the counter realized quickly that we were new and started explaining the menu. I picked the pita option and some random ingredients I thought they would taste good together. The whole thing turned out amazing. You can ask for sauces and rice on the side.
A bonus to this place is the free iced tea check in offer. They had 3 very refreshing flavors: green, peach lavender, and mango. I took a cup to go and sipped on it for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Uhm, wow! The amount of flavor they pack into a bowl here is amazing! The vegan options are so plentiful I had a hard time deciding what to get. It's a counter serve, Chipotle style fast casual \"build your own\" kind of place. I got a bowl with falafel, jalapeño hummus, veggies and spicy chug sauce. The spicy hummus and sauce were intense! It was also enough food for two other meals for me! 

The service was fast and friendly, and they were helpful when I was indecisive about what to get. It can be overwhelming trying to decide! I hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"Good mediterranean bowls, created in front of you while tell the cook what to use."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Gary (one part of my Dining Trio) and I were hungry after attending a conference. We were cruising by the choices on Broadway and saw \"HUMMUS\" on the strip mall store. That made me curious. So, we adventured into the restaurant to give it a try. Very worthwhile!

Whether you are a vegan, vegetarian or meat eater, you will find something you love here. The staff was very engaging, friendly and helpful. It took a few minutes to wrap our heads around how the choices work. You can engineer your own great meal, picking and choosing by sight what you want.

One thing: if you like falafel, try it here! It was some of the best. And I used to eat it when I traveled in the Middle East. Gary and I shared the largest plate and had a blast trying this and that, and adding this topping and that topping. The eggplant was pretty darn yummy, too.

Go in with a sense of adventure, and try the offerings. Try new tastes and open up your world to new flavors and textures. This type of food is very healthy. It was a fun dining experience and I wish Hummus were in Tucson. I'd be a regular!"}
{"text":"What a wide array of selections they have here!  Today I got a lunch bowl with gyro meat, eggplant, rice, lentil and kale salad, cilantro and jalapeño hummus and pita.  All followed by their homemade fresh brewed mint iced tea.  For my listening pleasure they had on an oldies jazz station that played the classic - \"The A Train\"."}
{"text":"You should go there either early or late if it is your first time and you are not sure what to order. The food is ok and I will go there again. Recommended:-)"}
{"text":"If you like garlic, you'll love Hummus Xpress. They do not hold back! I don't know if it was any one item or everything but I had garlic mouth for the rest of the night. Luckily my boyfriend and I both got dinner so it was okay - haha!

But besides sweating garlic I really liked this place. I love the Chipotle-style way of doing the food. I got a bowl with rice, beef, carrots, quinoa salad, classic hummus and tahini sauce. Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Some of the beef pieces were a tad on the dry side but overall it was good. Maybe it had been sitting a while? Also, the tatziki sauce was too strong for my taste so I would skip that next time. It's a lot of food. I ate half and was full so if you're like me you can easily get two meals out of a bowl.

Boyfriend has been looking for good falafel for a while now and he said it was very good. It must have been because he ate it all before I could try any!

The guys working behind the counter were really nice too. They were very patient and explained everything to us noobs. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Love it. Fresh ingredients, tons of customization, vegetarian and vegan options, and most importantly, feeds my constant craving for gyros. The guy making my pita was super nice and offered tons of suggestions -- I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 of 5 stars - top notch, top notch (manic clapping).

My colleague suggested we all dine here this past Friday and I'm so glad she did! It's only a 5 min drive from my office and GOOD!! 

We were going to get our lunches to go, because every table was occupied, but the stars were aligned and we got in the back bistro tables. Loud, very loud lunch crowd. Again, my ears are sensitive so the volume pains me and makes me rage, mean-mug the perps, and run outside. And choice of music was Country/Western in a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern fast food place? Errr... Nooooooo. Never, ever do that again, please. Not a fan of that genre but doesn't jive w the flavor of the joint. I need exotic sort of pop music from Lebanon or some shit...

The beautiful thing is that you build whatever you want to eat! It was a little daunting and laborious to use my brain during my lunch but I got in my flow. Tried the salad bowl with gyro meat, spicy hummus, grilled eggplant, and tzatziki sauce. Soooo wonderful; slightly different taste in every bite if you don't mix it, which is fun.

I ordered a piece of warm pita bread w salad but I think they should automatically throw this in for salad bowls... Don't you?? Haha

I'll return very soon for more dining experiences!"}
{"text":"I saw this place for the first time tonight and turned around to see what it was about. I really enjoyed the fact that they served healthy food and veggies in a quick and easy way. The hummus was very good and the choices were many. I went with the bowl for dinner and was pleasantly full and best of all my body actually knew what it ate. i will most definatly be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it! I got rice, chicken, zucchini, cilantro-jalapeno hummus, pickles, tomatoes and tzatziki. To me less is more, I want to be able to taste each individual element, so I passed on the lentils and other salads. Everything I had was flavorful, and I will be back for more. The iced tea was really great too. Only strange thing was I went in really wanting a pita sandwich, but was pushed into getting a bowl, because the pitas are served open faced. Would have been great to just have the meat, veggies & sauce in a pita wrap!"}
{"text":"Good selection of fresh ingredients make for a good Medeterranian meal!

First, I like that this place isn't a chain. Many have compared it with Chipotle, because you build your email in a similar way. I would also say it's very much like Pita Bistro for the same reason. I think Pita Bistro has a greater variety, though.

Food:
My meal was very tasty. I built a bowl with gyro meat, glazed sweet & spicy carrots, classic hummus, and topped with feta cheese, mixed pickled veggies, and garlic aioli. Everything was fresh tasting. The gyro meat was good, but nothing exceptional, and the garlic aioli was quite strong, but good!

Cost:
With tax, my bowl was $8.71 - which is similar to other hummus & pita style places.

Also, I wanted to go low-carb, so I didn't want the rice that normally comes in the bowl. I was disappointed that they would not let me substitute another veggie to replace the rice.

Service: 
When I arrived there was no queue, and the staff were friendly. I told them it was my first time there, and I was clearly undecided about what to get. But the staff didn't offer any suggestions, and didn't offer any samples to help me decide. I finally asked to sample one of the hummus, which they did, but they didn't offer any other samples. Last but not least, when I ordered my toppings I mentioned the garlic aioli, but was told tersely that wasn't a topping, it was a sauce. Really? Why the attitude?

Atmosphere:
This is a typical strip-mall shop, but smaller.

Overall:
I can see I'm in the minority with my 3-star review. They have an ok selection of ingredients and ok prices, but service wasn't up to par. I enjoyed my meal, so I might give it another try if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant!  Love the concept of picking your own combinations of food. Great flavor and very unique!  Love all the different types of hummus, veggies, and meats. Great place if you are vegan or gluten free! Love their friendly staff that let's you try samples of hummus. The owner, Eddie, is passionate about the food he serves and is very hospitable.  Very tasty!!"}
{"text":"Audio express, your home-home-home...

Just kidding. Looking for a new place to try and i chose this one from my never ending list. I walked in and sat at a table waiting for my friend and observed my surroundings. They've got a cool planter in the front with various plants which was unique. I looked through their menu and picked out what I thought would be a good combination.

When we got to the counter to order, I chose the white pita and got classic garlic hummus, flavored hummus can be overrated. They had falafel as a protein and I ordered that, which was a solid decision because they made them fresh. After that, I got roasted garlic red potato as my hot filling, lentil kale salad, and toppings: tomatoes, cucumbers, kalamata olives, green onions, pickled beets, and garlic aioli (can you tell I like garlic?) I was warned the olives were pitted and yet I still forgot and almost chomped down on one. Also I wouldn't get the beets next time, the sweet flavor threw me off. Otherwise, the mix of ingredients was tasty. I did have trouble eating the pita as the contents kept falling out, but it was fairly filling. I also got iced tea for checking in, score.

Honestly the concept of this place was strange to me, I wasn't sure if I'd like mixing all these ingredients together but it worked for the most part. Now I just need to fine tune which combos work best together."}
{"text":"Came here because my friends were in the mood for rice, but gotta say, the cilantro jalepeno hummus was the star of the plate we split. Went with a plate so we could try lots of different stuff all mixed together and it turned out to be a ton of food that we barely finished between two people.  All for less than 11 bucks! Love the carrots and the potatoes. The guys were super helpful and explained all of the options and gave recommendations. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just went there for a quick lunch and the food was amazing! Very fresh and extremely flavorful. I love places that can transform healthy food into something delicious and this place has it down. Will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious! Lots of healthy options, and I love that I could go here every day and get something totally different. The owners are great too- really friendly, helpful and they listen to your input. When they first opened, they only had bottled teas and fountain soda- I was bummed that I couldn't get brewed iced tea. Now they have unique teas and delicious lemonade as well. Even if you think you don't like Mediterranean food you should try this place- it's great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited to try yet another mostly vegetarian restaurant (don't worry carnivores...they have meet too!)

We each got a \"bowl\" - I loaded mine with Falafel, saffron rice, broccoli, eggplant (YUMMMY), cilantro & jalapeno hummus, cucumbers, onions, cilantro, tzaziki(?) sauce and shung sauce...

The Falafel were REALLY good...closest I've had in the states since I ate them in Israel. The flavors of all the veggies were really nice...and it came with a pita as well

Definitely a great place to go if you like hummus and mediterranean flavors!

We will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"A build your own bowl style restaurant with terrific Mediterranean fixings.

All of the ingredients are fresh, the flavors are amazing, and the bowl combinations are amazing! All of the employees have been super friendly and always make me smile, as the friendliness is contagious.



One of my favorite places to eat in Tempe."}
{"text":"Delicious and filling.  I had the small bowl and although it looked small a first, once you start piling the toppings it becomes a large salad!  The employees were nice and one walked me through the options and was patient as I reviewed what everything was.  It was filling and I even had leftovers."}
{"text":"When I think of Vegetarian food I think of Hummus Xpress. The food here inspires me.  

If I had access to this spot everyday, I would be encouraged to cross over to vegetarianism and feel like I didn't miss out on eating meat. The food is seriously that delicious. 

Favorites: 

All of the Hummus's! They have flavored hummus that they rotate.  Everyone's fav cilantro jalepeno-a bit too spicy for me. My favorite is the Roasted beet hummus which has a beautiful hot pink color. They are so creative with their hummus! 

Eggplant- roasted, creamy, complex and divine! 
 
Roasted broccoli- flavorfully rich roasted goodness

Falaffel- soft fluffy insides with a crunchy exterior and unexpected hint of cardamom 

Kale salad- fresh and zingy 

$9 for a bowl filled to the brim with diverse veggie goodness. 


Forget all the fancy Vegetarian/Vegan places in LA.  I'll take the excellently prepared recipes here, over the fancy pretentious, outrageously priced stuff any day."}
{"text":"I am half way done eating my meal and I couldn't yelp this place fast enough!  I got a plate with beef and gyro.  The beef was a recommendation by a employee.  The beef was/is AMAZING!  The meats were all warm.  The carrots were spicy and delish!  They gave me a ton of kalamata olives which I LOVE.  The portions are beyond generous.  

This place is top notch and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's like chipotle, except you make a pita instead of a burrito! Everything is fresh and delicious, and the owner and staff are super nice and explain it all very well. Thanks for giving Tempe some more vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Now a weekly spot after my first visit.  Fantastic, fresh & authentic Mediterranean food at unbelievable prices. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place. Was visiting the Phoenix area for work and saw the high rating on Yelp so I had to stop in. The food was delicious and fresh, seemed better than the other Mediterranean restaurant we checked out (Pita Jungle). All in all I would come back again."}
{"text":"I got a bowl. There is a good variety of options for meat and vegetarian entrees. Flavor for saffron rice, tabouleh, and gyro good. The texture to the gyro meat was a bit mushy, like it had been sitting the steamer bin for a long time. The grilled eggplant was more on the burnt than grilled. Classic hummus was spot on, good. My visit was at a little after 130pm. 

The foil bowl is deceiving in how filling it is. Filled with a meat or veggie entree, rice, salad, veggie side, hummus and a pita!

Would be willing to go back, try some other options like falafel and the lentil salad.

Service was nice. She asked if I had ever been there before. And since it was my first time she walked me through ordering."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating hummus like this.  Food was amazing! Very clean, and very friendly.  I highly recommend you eat here without delay. Savory, exploding with flavor and a hint of spice! I love this place! My new MUST EAT AT places in Tempe, AZ.!!"}
{"text":"Finally remembered to try this place, and I should have done it sooner.

Staff:  Insanely friendly and helpful

Selection: Pretty much have everything.  Tons of options for the gluten-free, vegetarian, or us carnivores.  I enjoy the vegetarian options as a change up and this place has variety to fit a wide array of tastes.

Food:  I was a bit overwhelmed by the options so there was no method to my madness.  It really was delicious and the portions were huge.  I went with the Gyro, some kale veggie, the basil hummus, rice, etc, etc.... too much to list.  I went with the bowl while my gf went with the salad.  

This place blew us away in all aspects.  Definitely plan on going back.  Only mini critique is to stay open later for us dinner procrastinators!"}
{"text":"Build a hummus bowl with your favorite grains and veggies? Um, yes please. This place is just awesome - the food is delicious, the staff is seriously nice, and it's very friendly to people who are veg or vegan or GF. It's also a great amount of food for the price. This is one of those restaurants that just makes you feel good after you eat there. 

Bonus: I know 99.99999% of the population doesn't care about the celery content of their food, but I am severely allergic and it was a huge relief to be told no celery is used anywhere here!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place. They are getting a bit stingy with their food. Quite expensive for the amount you get. Still hungry after I ate. They used to fill u up!!

Well the owners care about their customers! Addressed the issue properly! I hope they can maintain serving size!"}
{"text":"I eat here about twice a week. Eddie, the owner and chef, is super passionate about his food, and he and the whole crew are always friendly. Every meal I've ordered has been delicious and fresh. I love the different hummus options, and the falafel is really special with lots of herbs. The food is served Chipotle style, with lots of different fillers and toppings. Eat here, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times now and love the variety of food and its very filling."}
{"text":"Wow! This place has PER-SON-NAL-I-TY!

The guys that cook, serve and own this place are REALLY nice guys, and the food is VERY authentic.  For people who have a 100% Americanized palate, it might be a tad different for your tastes, but if you like meat, no meat, hummus, no hummus, tzatziki (sp?), or veggies, you should definitely stop by.  

To be honest, the food is really great, but it's the personalities of the people that work there that will keep me coming back.  I KNOW that I will leave in a good mood after having lunch there. :)"}
{"text":"Wow - huge portions! Great selection for vegetarian & vegan eaters. The staff was friendly & the service was super quick since we were the only ones there at the time (I hope business keeps picking up b/c this place is awesome!). The food was fresh & healthy. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"On the regular lunch rotation, I love this place.  When you need a healthy, fulfilling meal, and on a budget?  This is the place.  The price and the amount of food you get is a super deal.  Beats the big business burrito places and even the smaller gyro stops.  

I always get a pita with no rice.  It doesn't matter the hummus and veggie selection as they are all freshly made.  Tabouli is the salad of choice but I have tried the Mediterranean salad and I was impressed.  Unlimited toppings smothered with your choice of sauce.  I go with the Tzatziki but you had me at unlimited toppings.

Like I said, need a fulfilling meal but not that unhealthy stuff?  Go here!!!  On a budget and willing to try something new?  Go here!!!  I have...multiple times."}
{"text":"Delicious. Fresh. Huge portions...you could probably split with someone. 

Good stuff."}
{"text":"Honestly. Go here if you care about eating great tasting, healthy food and supporting a unique local business. It's like chipotle for Mediterranean food. Delicious."}
{"text":"This place is really good and authentic for $10 I had a huge plate of food the owner remembered us from our last visit. The beef brisket was amazing. This place is 5 stars all day."}
{"text":"you can make your own bowl alot of variety and its really tasty owners are friendly"}
{"text":"We found this place through yelp, love holes in the wall, personalized service intimate and cozy...nope! Not this place.
We were rudely greeted (if you can call it a greeting) by the owner, who had an attitude,  told us to order right away or move out the way. I would have understood if the place was packed and we took longer than a minute to check out the menu. But nope! No one was behind us and we had just arrived.  
We told him we were ready and aparently this bothered him since he asked us 3 questions in this order. 1. Is this your first time here? We said yes. 2. Do you have any questions?  Not yet, but we're ready to order. And #3 you should have questions,  this is your last chance.  We looked at each other thinking is this guy on drugs?? Cause he was hyped and angry....well who knows...we ordered the gyros.
Don't care for the food. It was bland and they force you to add sides you didn't want. Who puts rice on a gyro??? 
I've had great Mediterranean and that was not it. Although bland the food was cooked right and there were some healthy choices.
I would consider this place probably a modernized or westernized Chipotle style Mediterranean restaurant.
So if you want classic, look else where."}
{"text":"Their food truck came to my office complex yesterday for the first time so I decided to give them a try. I ordered the gyro bowl but am trying to do low carb right now so I got it without the rice. To my surprise it also came with a piece of pita bread. Well of course I ate that because I am not going to say no to pita if it is right in front of me. Overall the meat and veggies tasted great; I really loved that each had it's own unique flavoring. I ordered the eggplant and carrots for my two veggie options but he offered to give me a third since they were hardly any carrots left so I also got kale. Unfortunately the kale was a bit watery, even though it tasted amazing, and so that sort of diluted the hummus. So the consistency was a bit off but the red pepper hummus was still delicious. I really enjoyed my meal and I hope that the truck comes back again."}
{"text":"I was only in Phoenix two days and ate here twice, that should tell you something! Pick a pita, bowl, or plate and call out your favorites. You get proteins, vegetables, rice, hummus and add ons and sauces, so lots of possible combinations. The falafel were great, fried eggplant was friggin' delicious. Hummus came in at least six different flavors, I tried the chipotle and roasted red pepper, both were fantastic. Tabbouleh fresh, lentil kale salad was off the chain. Service at the counter was above average. Maybe i need to move to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Excellent service and amazing food. I stopped by on my way back to the office and didn't expect much of it. This place blew me away. From the moment I walked in. These guys were courteous and was patient as I make my decision on what to eat. Everything was flavorful. Don't think twice, just stop in!!!! 

You have to try their falafel! Delish!"}
{"text":"Mediterranean food is almost binary. Its either great or its terrible. After having had some really amazing experiences at other places, it feels a little harsh to dig into Hummus express, but there's so many ways that it felt uninspiring. Its definitely got potential, but it falls short in too many places. The customer service is good, and they have some good toppings and sauces, but you're limited to just 1 sauce. The meat is hit or miss depending on what you get.

If I'm getting a platter/plate, I safely assume that the rice that is served should be decent. How a Mediterranean food restaurant fails to execute rice is beyond my belief. At 6 pm, you can't blame the lack of customers for rice that seemed not only stale but completely overcooked. It looked like couscous, but tasted mushy like mashed potatoes. The chicken was decent, and the gyro actually had great taste and texture. However, the braised beef reminded me of a bland pot roast that was undercooked leaving it tough and chewy. I thought it was peculiar this was even an item at this place, but I would definitely stay away from that one. 

There's plenty of fresh, high-quality toppings to choose from, but they are a little stingy with them. You get a very small pinch of each thing making it similar to a sampler. The eggplant tastes great and was one of the few toppings they didn't hold back on. Meanwhile though, the sauces were plagued by the same thing exhibited by the toppings. I don't quite understand why you're limited to one sauce when most other places let you try as many as you want, within reason of course.

At the moment, I can't really recommend this place. Its good, but has far too many holes to patch up. The service is excellent, and I'm sure they'll turn it around. I just don't think it fits my tastes."}
{"text":"Design your own meal! I love it. Hummus Xpress offers fast, fresh options that are a lot healthier than what you'd normally consider as \"fast food.\" You start with your choice of wrapping or container such as pita, bowl, or plate. You get seasoned rice automatically with your order, and can then choose your meaty protein, falafel, or go veg where you can double up on each section. There are various delicious vegetables to choose from, several hummus flavors, salads, and a last section of condiments and sauce to finish your creation.

I opted for a vegetarian bowl with grilled eggplant, ginger carrots, beet and classic hummus, lentil salad, white bean salad, marinated onion with carrot, chickpeas, and garlic aioli to top it off. Quite a lot of food for a bowl! Each component was full flavored and went well with each other. My favorites of the bowl were the ginger carrots, eggplant, and beet hummus. As a side note, be aware that the garlic aioli is delicious but is made with raw garlic so you will have stinky dragonfire breath if you get it :).

Service was very friendly and cheerful. The space is small so it might be cramped if you go with a large group. 

Overall I love the concept and the food is fresh, fast, and flavorful. I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Wife and I were headed on foot to another restaurant when we walked by Hummus Xpress.  We both love Mediterranean cuisine, but were reluctant to try it because it looked too \"fast food,\" and we were looking for table service.  We are so thrilled we decided to give it a try.

Fresh and delicious doesn't quite do it justice.  The flavors were sensational, the ingredients many and varied, the choices, Pita, Bowl, Plate or Salad, gave us many options, each made to order, all focused on homemade middle-eastern favorites, such as tabbouleh, tzatziki, eggplant, pickled vegetables, spicy chicken, simmered beef, gyro, kalamata olives, chickpeas, and of course, fresh, homemade hummus in four flavors.  Every one was delicious.  We awarded HX five stars despite occasional, brief objectionable background music.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Not only is the food absolutely delicious, The service is absolutely incredible. Even though we no longer live in Tempe, we make an extra special trip just to come here. The food is authentic and their vegetable selection it offers a wide variety. I love the cilantro hummus and the beet hummus.  The service though is top notch. The staff is so friendly and helped my nine-year-old son choose the best stuff for his plate. We will be back time and time again. We love you Hummus Xpress!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great, I've never had a problem with any of the staff and they are super helpful. As a vegan/vegetarian they know which of the their product fits my diet. My only gripe is that they need bigger water cups, but that won't stop me from coming. Keep up the good work Hummus Xpress!"}
{"text":"I think we have an up and coming Yelp favorite everyone! They have only been open a short time but the quality of the food is quite good. They have it set up so that one  goes through it in sort of an operational line, picking the items one wants in the pita, bowl or the dinner plate size, and the food is basically Lebanese. 

The seasoned rice (yes, I forgot what it is called) is amazing and for vegetarians there is a bevy of no-meat options. I did try the gyros meet with the dinner size option but the grilled eggplant is also quite good. They also have a seasonal veggie option and the day I went it was rainbow kale - kale, how cool is that one folks!

I plan to go back and update my review after a few times but right now I would say this is a culinary gem located, as Juan B notes, in a strip mall, but that is sometimes where you find the best eating experiences, right? Looks like, based on Kory L's review, that I will have to try the falafel next time, sounds delicious! :-)"}
{"text":"Mmm! MMM! Love this place and love the concept. The food is fresh, flavorful, and fantastic! I like to get a bowl with rice, gyro meat, glazed carrots, eggplant, tzatziki, and shug with a pita on the side. Your belly will thank you after! The owner/chef puts his passion for food in his choices and you can tell in the service and taste. I hope they open more around the Valley!"}
{"text":"Update- The last two times I have been here and ordered my meal to go, I have unfortunately found hair in my food both times. I really love the food, but finding hair in your food really ruins it. Hummus Xpress I love you, but please be more careful when preparing and serving your food!"}
{"text":"I eat here almost every day for lunch, and can't get enough. The flavor packed in every bite is outstanding!  It's the best Mediterranean food in town, and with the Chipotle style serving, your in and out quick."}
{"text":"Service 5/5: owner and employees were very helpful and genuine. 

Food 5/5: I am Lebanese and while my family does some dishes slightly different it is overall really good. I respect the fact that they don't hold back on garlic in the hummos    

Overall experience 5/5: they really made the place look nice from what it previously was, food and service very good"}
{"text":"Always fresh and tasty. Great options for vegetarian and non-vegetarians alike. The pita is overflowing and the grilled veggies are awesome."}
{"text":"This food is AWESOME!!!
Got this delivered to my office through Foodsley and couldn't have been happier.
I ordered a bowl with gyro meat, grilled zucchini, carrots, ginger lemon hummus, feta cheese and a garlic aioli. SO GOOD!!!
Can't wait to eat from this menu again. May have to just go to the place myself!"}
{"text":"The Veggie Bowl is the way to go. But the Gyro is delicious also. I have been here a handful of times and I'm always happy with my choices. The service is outstanding, the food is fresh and the prices are amazing! Don't miss this place. It's worth the stop."}
{"text":"delicious!!! and I ordered through uber eats and they put a personalized note in my to go order. great little touch. I will 100% order from here again!"}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean cuisine and I have tried quite a few places in Phoenix that serve Mediterranean cuisine and out of all those places Hummus xpress is on the top of my list. It's chipotle style serving is amazing. Their saffron rice is out of this world. It's a must visit if u are in Phoenix or visiting."}
{"text":"The food tasted amazing! I love how they have signs next to the food that tells me what is vegan. They give you tons of food! I always have leftovers on top of great costumer service every time! I definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Very customizable. If you want to go simple the chicken, original hummus, and olives are a great choice. But there are so many options to spice up your bowl. The owner helps you through the process of choosing your meats, sides, and sauces very patiently. You can tell he is proud of the food that is put out, as he should be. A distinction between this place and any other restaurant is that the flavors are from real spices and herbs, not just sugar and salt."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through Uber eats.  Food was delivered quickly, but incomplete.  Ordered baklava, waters, extra protein and sauce and didn't get it.  The food itself tasted good, no complaints there, but disappointing that my order was wrong."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. So many healthy and tasty options.  It's set up like a Chipotle where you select what you want as they are plating it up.   This is a new regular place for me."}
{"text":"I don't know what I am more mad about, the waste of calories or he waste of money. 8$ for a \"bowl\" of pretty much 3 pieces of vegetable. They don't even half fill the contact, it's unbelievable. I feel like I just ate a salt stick. I can not believe the reviews for this place. Pita bistro is so much better than this place it is ridiculous. Never ever again."}
{"text":"Hummus Express has the feel of a neighborhood cafe with more authentic fare. I come here on about a weekly basis. By far the best gyro meat I've ever had. Apparently, the trick is to marinate. I usually get a bowl, which seems quite reasonable price-wise given the amount of food. I am also quite fond of the grilled eggplant."}
{"text":"Many options to choose from, great quality and everything is made fresh. Staff is very helpful and gives great advice on what to mix and match. You have to try everything and try different combos. Very clean and always kinda busy for lunch. Gyro meat could be sliced a little thinner but oh well. I see people comparing this place to Chipotle...same concept, sure, but like any other \"assembly line\" food places, YOU pick what you want. If your bowl didn't come out to your liking, uhh, hello, your fault. Unless you're complaining about the actual quality/flavor of the food, comparing Hummus Xpress to Chipotle is pointless."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the fresh taste and the atmosphere ! The restaurant is always clean warm and inviting and not  crowded either  .The idea of the way you order is like Chipotle .  You start with a pita of your choice white or wheat then have the employees pile what ever sounds good to you .The cooked veggies I am not a fan of but everything else is fresh light and delicious ! The employees are always friendly and will let your try samples before giving you a generous spoon full .The different hummus choices sound odd but once you try them you'll be hooked !! I like getting alot of food for a good price and this place is great for the amount you get .  My only complaint is my husband and I  tried the baklava once it was really rich and flaky like it was supposed to be but a bit over priced for such a tiny piece.One day I will have to try the falafals . My only wish is that my current apartment was closer ;) so I could eat it more often .All in all if your looking for something fresh different and something your gluten free , vegetarian or carnivore people in your life will like this is a great hole in the wall !"}
{"text":"Actually, Middle Eastern food is one of our favorites, and we will probably be back -- if we happen to pass by at lunch time, and we are hungry.  But there is nothing about Hummus Xpress that would make it worth a trip.

Like the others of its genre, epitomized by Chipotle Mexican Grill, Hummus Xpress allows you to choose from four presentations (basically the container you want the food served in), four proteins, and various sides.  They build your meal in your container, you pay at the register, find a table, and sit down to enjoy -- well, to enjoy some of it.

The location is small and basic, which is okay, but what is not okay is problems with the food.  The gyro meat, for example, was far too thickly cut so that it did not get that crispy caramelized crust on the outside, and it was luke warm.  The spicy carrots were unevenly cooked, with many pieces raw and others mushy.  The signature hummus was nowhere near as good as the Sabra variety you can buy at a grocery store.  And the pita was dull, cold, and generally substandard.  Some items were quite good, however, such as the braised beef (brisket), kale salad and rice.  

But taken on balance, the food is just average.  Hummus Xpress does not rate four or five stars, no matter what standard you judge it by."}
{"text":"I love Greek Food! So when I found out we were catering in for a work meeting I was excited to try something new. 

It was a little difficult navigating the menu that we had, post card sized, and didn't list all the options and had some options listed that were not available any longer. Not to worry though, the manger was very helpful in breaking it all down. 

We ordered a lot of food, pretty much min one of everything and doubled up on a few others. We had lamb, and chicken and falafel, and 6 kinds of hummus, and sauces galore. They delivered right on time, helped me get everything set up, they provided all the utensils and plates, and were very nice. Everything tasted super fresh and I am pretty sure we ate happily for at least two days. 

I have yet to stop in to the location for a single meal, but next time I am in the area I will surely try. Highly recommend for your office event."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots for some good vegan food. The fried eggplant is amazing!! Love the variety of choices and everything tastes awesome together."}
{"text":"Great service! Happy people! We ordered 2 vegan lunch specials and everyone was so helpful. The food was delicious and huge portions. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!  A great find!  Roll your own plates with fresh, perfectly spiced food."}
{"text":"I need to Xpress my appreciation for this place.

Hummus Xpress is all about cafeteria-style, mix and match Mediterranean food.  You start with a plate, a bowl, or a pita, then pick a meat (or an non-meat, or no meat), some veggies (lots of choices), some hummus (or not) and then a salad and rice (or not), and then maybe a sauce (or not).  Do it yourself--get a lot of a little or a little of a lot--however you want it.  There's always many choices.

Their hummus is shot through with kale and cilantro--enough to add greens and a little spice, but not too much.  Falafel?  Fala-full of flavor.  Nothing is pre-made, EVERYTHING is fresh.  Great taste, great price, nice and fast, extreme service.  Good for lunch or dinner or a snack.  Veggie friendly.

Work nearby? Lunch.  Live nearby?  They deliver.  Do it."}
{"text":"Hummus Xpress is legit! One of the best fast-casual restaurants in the Valley. Metro Phoenix is lousy with Mediterranean restaurants, and that's a good thing. I had a conversation with the owner about this, and we both agreed that Pita Jungle played a big part in spreading the growing acceptance and consumer love for this delicious cuisine. 

The Mediterranean restaurants in town are all pretty damn good for the most part. I would be hard-pressed to pick a favorite. This one is right up there at the top of the list. In fact, I may just go ahead and make a list. 

The way you order here is similar to eating at Chipotle or Q-doba, but instead of tortillas you're getting a pita and different fixings... except cheese. Pretty much everything you could pile onto a plate here is healthy, and it's all fresh. This would definitely make this a great place to try as your first foray into this type of food if you're a virgin.

The kitchen is immaculate and you can see it all from the dining room. The service is friendly and quick. And of course, the food is fresh and absolutely delicious. Since you get to pick what you want to eat, if you don't like it - it's pretty much your fault. I had a pita with beef and fixings, while my girlfriend had a chicken plate (which also comes with a pita, but you get extra protein). We both ate ourselves stuffed. 

This strip used to be kinda dead - this spot used to be an always-empty Chinese place where the owner didn't give a shit anymore, but the new owner cleared out all remnants of what it used to be and transformed it into something great. The neighbor at Detroit Coney Grill did the same thing, and now this strip is bustling. 

Hummus Xpress delivers (like actually delivers food to your door), so there's really no excuse to not try it. It was easy to give 5 stars here... I love this place. I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious! I eat here whenever I'm in town. They offer different types of hummus and you can mix and match what's added to your dish. My favorite place for Mediterranean food. Very friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"The pita bowls are delicious! I recommend the jalapeño cilantro hummus with chicken on a wheat pita! I loved the potatoes for my vegetable option. Then top it off with garlic aioli! My only complaint is that they close too early!"}
{"text":"Thought this place was ok. It's a cool concept. Wasn't a fan of the Tahiti sauce... Had absolutely no flavor. Some items in my bowl were super hot and others cold. Lots of overpowering flavors but I'd probably be back."}
{"text":"Always FANTASTIC FOOD! Never have I had a bad meal or an unpleasant experience.  Always delicious! The Braised beef with spicy carrots are a must!!!"}
{"text":"Chipotle meets the Mediterranean! You choose your portion size, meat (gyro, beef, chicken, or for our vegetarian friends, falafel) and bountiful toppings. When they ask if you want rice, YOU GIVE AN EMPHATIC 'YES' - the saffron rice is amazing.

At the end of the counter you have a generous portion of fresh, flavorful food. I love that they have multiple varieties of hummus every day (to be expected given the name), and each that I've tried so far is delicious. It's a good thing the flavors meld, because there isn't enough room in the bowl for it all without selections overlapping or stacking (i.e. hummus over your rice). This could be a minus to some folks.

A heads up - the parking is lousy (it is in a strip mall) and there aren't many seats inside. The soda is reasonably priced and has free refills, but only comes in one size, 12 ounce, which bugs my wife. Skip it for takeout and swing by Circle K."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Just enjoyed a terrific lunch, I will be back on a regular basis. You will not be disappointed in the food here a can't miss."}
{"text":"We went here on a recommendation from someone else, and at one point my wife even said she was upset it took us so long to find this place.  Food was good, staff was friendly, and for the amount of food you get, the price is very reasonable.  We'll be back.

Also, they told us they're open until 9 PM on weekends, and they deliver now.  So don't trust the hours above."}
{"text":"I just had a ton of Hummus Xpress food at the Vegan Festival in Phoenix. The food was amazing! Truly! The guys preparing the food were so great. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! This place is awesome. A vegan hidden gem!! Excellent selection of add ons at no additional charge. The guy working there, possibly an owner, was very down to earth, made great suggestions and friendly. Definitely coming here again. The food was AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"My experience is based on their food truck. I couldn't  finish the chicken hummus bowl I I ordered. Very messy and quickly thrown together, rubbery chicken that wasn't well seasoned (pretty sure it came from a can), mushy carrots, and I couldn't even find the hummus and rice. I'll chalk it up to them not being prepared for a large lunch rush, but they didn't serve anything that would make me a returning customer. Disappointing dish after waiting so long in line."}
{"text":"This place is great. Food tastes great and it's super fast. It's popular so you might want to come just before or just after lunch hour."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, just quality food at an affordable price. Hummus for days. Really great service."}
{"text":"Just YES! These ginger carrots I had in my bowl this afternoon...to die for! Eat here! You get a TON of food for a great price, and everyone there is super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Hummus Xpress is a healthy, authentic restaurant that's great for lunch! I explain it as a chipotle for hummus(so clearly better). I always get the bowl, lamb or chicken, rice, red pepper hummus, and all the toppings I want. I leave feeling full and healthy and recommend this play to anyone. Not to mention, the staff is incredible and super accommodating/helpful!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and authentic food. A/c doesn't work well so it's a little warm this time of year. I will b back but may order it to go ;)"}
{"text":"Everything was outstanding.  Lunch bowl with rice, chicken, broccoli, jalapeño cilantro hummus, tabbouleh, + toppings and pita for under $10. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Awesome concept for Mediterranean food (like Chipotle). The people were great and very friendly. The food was right up there with others I've had. Definitely give this place a try. 

4 stars because of atmosphere. It's a very basic to-go feel. I'd still go again!"}
{"text":"First time in.red pepper hummus,gyro and chicken was succulent.this is now my go to place,to eat in or fly by and pickup.Nicole explained the dishes and informed us of her favorites with a smile through out,as well came out to ask if everything was good and up to our expectations. Thank you Nicole !!"}
{"text":"Since I have discovered this place October of 2015, I have been here easily 50+ times.  I'm 2nd in Check In's here for a reason.  Everything here is made in house every day with the freshest ingredients and the majority of it is vegan safe, they also offer a range of specialty drinks and pastry cupcakes as well to add variety to their menu.  The food is ALWAYS consistent and amazing.  When every I bring someone here to try it, they don't just say: \"this is good\", they say: \"WOW.. This is AMAZING!\".  They do an amazing job at personalizing your experience every time you go in, a place where everyone knows your name and they treat you like family, always greeting you and always telling to \"have a wonderful day\", always telling you \"thank you for coming in today\" and letting you know that your business is appreciated.  Hummus Xpress is hands down with out a doubt not only the best place I have ever eaten, but my favorite place to eat.  I'm very thankful they are around and I hope after reading this review you will come in for the same experience I have had again and again."}
{"text":"Been to this place twice. I live in New Mexico. I was there a second time because I made sure to book the same hotel so I'd be close to this place.

SO good. Lemonade with rosewater! Braised kale. Delicious chick pea and lentil salads. GREAT falafal. Good tzaziki. YUMMY baklavah.

Had leftovers that I scarfed a few hours later at my hotel. I have a roving palate, but there was nothing I wanted more than more of my Hummus Xpress. 

Call first. I was sad to find out they were closed pretty early on the weekends."}
{"text":"I used to go hear with empty stomach, but now the prices have gone up and the food portions have gone down.... time to move on. 
They do have good food though.. cant just bash them."}
{"text":"I recommend hummus xpress to everyone who likes good Mediterranean food! The combo choices offer anything you can think of- a great selection of meats, hot and cold veg, hummus, and sauces. My boyfriend and I got to sample ALL of the hummus options and it was so hard to pick which was best because they were ALL unique and delicious! I got the \"bowl\" which is the smallest of the combo meals, but it was very filling and satisfying AND I have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.
Finally, the service was tremendous! The gentlemen serving the food were very knowledgable and were eager to give recommendations :)"}
{"text":"I've been to hummus express maybe 3 or 4 times now, and I must say they are hard to beat when it comes to speed, flavor, and portion size. I've always gotten a hummus bowl, but recently got the pita instead and you get more than enough food that it's an even better value. For the hot veggies, I absolutely recommend either fried eggplant or their grilled zucchini (my new favorite), and the tabbouleh salad is quite good as well. Their gyro is a bit fattier than I'd prefer, but I still can't get enough of it. You can get as many toppings as you'd like too!

This place is an absolute gem and a must for either lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to go to this place!!!!!! Let's say third time is a charm! Hummus xpress was finally open! I ordered the plate with lamb gyro and beef brisket!!! Mmmmm! The goodness didn't stop there.

I went for the beet and chipotles hummus, all the sides (I love vegetables) and you must know their is unlimited toppings of your choosing. To top it off I got garlic aioli and taZiki. I'll be back before my flight out!

I also received free tea with the yelp deal and finished off dinner with a pistachio baklava."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome change from the norm. Great food, cool people, and lots of options. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the best place in the Phoenix area to get an authentic Pita. It really reminds me of Pita/falafel stands I have been to in the middle East. 

Don't be afraid to try everything! It is all good. 
My recommendation is to not miss out on the fried eggplant and schug."}
{"text":"Close to the office and way better food than a drive-thru.  First time there today and I was warmly greeted and guided through my choices.  I got a bowl with rice, broccoli, chicken, classic hummus, tabouli and some tzatziki, with a wheat pita.  Plenty of food.  Price was fair.  I'm adding it to my Go To places for lunch."}
{"text":"Great for a quick bite and won't leave you feeling like your in a food coma the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"My first time to this place and from out of town. Went there for lunch and it was amazing! Customer service was excellent! Also, I will be back there for dinner."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. I did not like this place one bit. It was very easy to find, and very convenient because I work down the street from this place, so this is how they got the one star. So I walked in, I was impressed because it was very quaint and clean. This usually puts me in a good mood when the area is clean. So I checked out the menu online before I came so I can get an idea of the options. I was super amped!! I adore hummus, pita and veggies,  so I felt like I was winning !! Wrong, the vegetarian bowl was this weird combination of cold, soggy and hot stuff piled on top of each other. I believe they are trying to emulate Chipotle ' s Aesthetic, sorry, not feeling it. What did it in for me is that the kale was cooked with the stems on. What a lazy move! I will not be coming here again.  Sorry"}
{"text":"SUPER TASTY, Friendly Staff, FREE TEA with a YELP CHECK IN. I had the Tasty Falafel. The traditional hummus was very tasty. I had the tabouleh salad. Very tasty. The tzatziki sauce is made with yogurt. The tzatziki sauce is very good. Small dining room. Maybe 40 people max. Good access to Interstate 10. Easy to find."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great value and service. Highly recommend the hummus and veggies because they were delicious and nutricious!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff is efficient and friendly when choosing your options and there is plenty of parking. 

The food is fantastic! If you like Mediterranean style, then I don't see a need for anywhere else. Prices are reasonable and the portions are the perfect size. I elect to get the plate w/gyro meat rice and 2 sides w/salad , hummus and a pita.
Do it. You won't regret going if you like Mediterranean style."}
{"text":"Had a chicken salad with the eggplant. Tried the roasted pepper hummus with it. . Lots of toppings to choose from. It was really good"}
{"text":"Reading the previous reviews I feel like I missed something. Wanted a gyro today and thought I would try someplace new. Went in and the gentlemen working the counter were very nice and explained how everything worked and made some suggestions. I was already planning on a gyro so I went with that. 

The pita was very good and ended up being the best part of the meal. The meat was swimming in oil/grease to the point where it was hard to choke down. The flavor was ok, but they were thick hunks that seemed like they were fried in oil to make them crispy. I generally prefer a more shaved gyro but my issue is more with all the grease pouring off the meat. The tzatziki sauce was very bitter and they used a ton of it. It was like having tzatziki meat soup served on a pita. I actually ended up scraping most of it off. It also didn't sit with me very well after the fact. I can't imagine I'll be back but based on all the good reviews, maybe it was just an off day."}
{"text":"This place is so good and filling! I ate this a few times. You can make your own bowl and put how much of it you want. The owners of the restaurant are friendly and are usually working. I've ordered food for lunch and had it for both lunch and dinner because there was that much of it left over, it was so good! Definitely try this place out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Totally delicious food and the service could not have been nicer.  I asked the clerk for a suggestion and he hooked me up personally. He prepared a bowl, mix of beef & chicken & veggies. The saffron rice has the best flavor... My meal was colorful, healthy & delicious. I'm a future return customer!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've eaten here twice now and both times were great. The menu is a little complicated, but the staff is really friendly and will walk you through the process. Tons of options for vegetarians. Everything has great flavor and the food somehow all works together in one big bowl. Standouts for me are the chipotle hummus and the eggplant."}
{"text":"Hot pink hummus? Now you're speaking my language. This place is like a delicious choose your own Mediterranean flavor adventure. 

You can get a pita, salad or bowl and fix it up the way you want- sort of like Chipotle or Cafe Rio. Everything I tried was outstanding. I had two kinds of hummus- beet and cilantro. The star for me was beet. It was slightly sweet and so pretty on the plate- neon pink!

The chicken was tender and flavorful and the bowl had saffron rice which was also a delight. The tzatziki sauce had a slight spicy kick which I've never had, but ended up really enjoying as well. 

The owner was working the counter and he was so nice. I really hope this place does well. 

I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Pretty bomb!! Total dive in a marginal area.

It's basically a Subway but Mediterranean style food and you make it into the bowl you want. It's solid.

Skip their Gluten Free  cupcakes. Those were terrible.

When you're done grab a Donut at the Donut Co in the same parking lot. Apple Fritter donuts to die for.

Will be back"}
{"text":"This place would get 5 stars, but the hours are so terrible, and you never know if you're going to get there and see it closed for some reason. When they are open, they can not be beat. I haven't found a more enjoyable mediterranean food experience... when they are actually open that is."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight. Five stars for the service alone. Granted we were the only customers in the building, but the owner/chef really went above and beyond to please us on our first visit. Really, I was blown away.

The food was good. I could tell that some of the items had been sitting out for a while. But I do not fault them for it. Why? Because it was completely dead inside. According to the owner/chef, they are extremely busy during lunch hours, but traffic slows down severely around dinnertime. Given that, they at least had every advertised item available, and most of it looked and tasted fresh.

So come on, people. Try this place for dinner sometime. Not only will the owner thank you, but so will the rest of the dinnertime customers."}
{"text":"I had a FANTASTIC lunch date here with my husband today. They had live music (not sure why) but it didn't last long. 

The food was SOOOOO tasty. It was nice to have so many side vegetable options. I got to try a huge variety of food (3 sides, 2 kids of hummus, 1 protein, and all the toppings you can want).

It was a lite and refreshing lunch. The service was EXCELLENT (i.e. the guys behind the counter were really nice). I'll be going back a lot."}
{"text":"This place has many vegan options and it's all labeled as you pick out what you want to eat. My falafel bowl was great! Loved the garlic hummus I had with it."}
{"text":"This place turned out to be a VERY nice surprise. It is definitely similar to Chipotle but the quality of food here is much better in my opinion. Im only comparing it to Chipotle due to the similarites as making your order and choosing what you would like. Fresh cooked veggies, variety in meat and hummus. You also get rice and toppings as well. 

Easy quick dinner to pick up and take home and its very filling...and given that you pretty much cannot get anything that's unhealthy here you dont feel as guilty after you stuff your face and devour the whole bowl :)"}
{"text":"For Mediterranean-style food this place is awesome!
They have a huge variety of food and it all tastes really good.
The flavors are perfect and when you get a plate, it will be more than enough food for anyone."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They have a lemon ginger hummus that is out of this world! And their eggplant is excellent as well. Great value, and fresh ingredients with friendly staff."}
{"text":"A-may-zing. 

Think Chipotle-style, pick your stuff, but for Middle Eastern food. If they have this same stuff each day, I could eat here daily.

If you have not been here, you are missing out. I highly suggest you stop by.

I got a bowl and all vegan ingredients: chipotle hummus, beet hummus, tabboule, kale, falafel, etc.

Can't wait till we have like 6 or 7 of these in town."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the weirder reviews I'll ever write. When I rate something 5 stars, not only does the food have to be hallucination-inducing, uncontrollably drooling awesome, but so does the service itself. In this case, the service pretty much is non-existent and confusing to the core but they have me whipped, chained, and weak at the knees for their food. 

Eddie owns the place and he's pretty awesome at what he does. The flavors are so intense and so on point but not only that, they're kind of visually stunning as well. Be mesmerized by how intensely pink the beet hummus is or be nervous when you see how many fresh green jalapeno specks there are in the cilantro hummus. Their rice is a beautiful saffron golden color and always fluffy like a pillow. Their meats, especially their lamb and beef ... would you like some meat with your steamy meat juices? Because that's how succulent they are. Everything is just an explosion of flavor because of how many herbs and spices they use in each dish. I will warn you that by eating their potatoes, you should plan on not speaking to anyone for the next 8 hours because it is just deliciously bombarded with an obnoxious amount of garlic. 

I order catering all the time for my workplace and the moment the work floor get an email that there's Hummus Xpress - they drop everything for it. These full grown men are willing to sit still through a 45-minute vendor presentation that probably doesn't even relate to what they do just to be able to enjoy the food rather than go out for lunch themselves. In our world, that's some major dedication. 

Service? Let's just say it's been a trip. Sometimes when I call to order, their phone line doesn't work and they just don't fix it - just because. So then you're stuck for 3 months having to resort to ordering something else while you live on edge that your insatiable coworkers might jump you. Finally get a hold of them? Kitchen fire - closed. Need a catering order? E-mail it and hope that they show up at the time you requested because they never responded or asked for payment. Get the receipt - not even sure what they charged you for but it looks about right because you're too busy already stuffing your face. I'm sure it's different when you're there in person, but no matter how many obstacles they throw my way to make it seem like they don't want my business at all, I still keep vying for their attention like some crazy pre-teen Justin Bieber fan."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Friendly staff, fast food and a nice, small and cozy place to eat.
Food is great. Love the different authentic toppings and the vast variety of hummus.

Good baklava as well."}
{"text":"I had the hummus bowl with chicken and LOVED IT!! Would definitely recommend this place, new favorite! The beet hummus is a must!"}
{"text":"Tried it couple of weeks ago, the flavors are alright, but the food was really cold and the rice was dry and crunchy, its like been sitting in the heat overnight. Being Lebanese and being familiar with the authentic food, I was fooled by 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time in a long while. They're food has definitely not changed and they still have amazing quality. I got the pita ($7) with rice, chicken, zucchini, jalapeño cilantro hummus, olives, cucumbers, tomatoes, cheese, and peppers, with garlic aioli sauce. Perfect price for a lot of food! The only downside is that I don't live close enough to come on a regular basis, but I did see that they have a food truck! Employees are also very friendly and were remembering other people's previous orders."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots in the hood. It's quick and you get a ton of food. The cilantro jalapeño sauce is good on errythang."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  The portions are pretty good sized, I got a Gyro and my wife got a falafel pita.  Both were really tasty.  We got the red pepper hummus which was about the only minor disappointment.  It didn't taste bad, but it was thin in consistency so that included with everything else made the pita soggy.  I am anxious to try other things there though, lots of variety."}
{"text":"The best in Tempe for a fast, filling and healthy meal! Their falafel is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place is great. Awesome hummus and great veggie options. Meat has always been good and you can get lunch for under $8."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place? It's awesome, delicious, such a great spot.

The only sort of complaint is that their brewed ice tea is often moldy. You can absolutely tell that it's either being kept around too long, not being brewed fresh and regularly.....or something needs to get cleaned out. If this issue was addressed this place would be perfect to me :-)"}
{"text":"We got bowls mixed with classic and jalapeno hummus, with pickled veggies, eggplant and pepperoncinis with some whole wheat pita.
I kid you not, my dining companion licked the bowl.  I wanted to, but I managed to scrape the bowl clean and then i admit, I used my fingers too...unbelievably delicious.  Now, if he just delivered, I'd spend all my money here!"}
{"text":"Kind of an interesting place - I think it reminds me of a old coffee house from the 70's but with food.

Speaking of food - it was amazing - lives up to its reputation- I enjoyed it and when I return to the are I will visit again.

Service was very orderly and efficient- I was concerned the lay (of service items) might make it difficult but no worries.

If you like her hummus - stop in!"}
{"text":"I must say, it has been YEARS since i have been so excited about a restaurant as I was when I walked in to Hummas Xpress.  Food was awesome, portion was awesome, the staff was so friendly.  At one point I felt like I was being cheered on by all as I ordered each element of my platter... It was awesome.

Nice date night place too.  We took our food to go, but it was setup so nicely that next time we will have it to stay and enjoy ourselves a bit longer."}
{"text":"still really liking this place! and I recently learned that their vegetarian \"bowl\" option is great. usually with a bowl you get 1 meat, 1 veggie, 1 hummus, 1 salad.  with the vegetarian option you get 2 veggies, 2 salads, and 2 hummus!  I ordered that last night and it was delicious.  the broccoli is my favorite.  it's one of those places where you can eat vegetarian and not feel deprived afterwards or hungry again 1 hour later...."}
{"text":"Food was really good but be careful with the kalamata olives still have seeds and I was not expecting that as I bit into my pita. :( 
Food was good great but, I about chipped a tooth with the first bite."}
{"text":"The flavor and spices are great however it was on food that was sitting for a while.  Healthier options available.  The plate is good if your hungry, has a lot of options."}
{"text":"This place was TASTY!! It was a bit confusing at first figuring out how to order, but the owner was great and explained it all. I ended up with a hummus bowl + falafel for only like $5. The falafel were fresh and I liked both hummus's (hummusi? hummuses? hummus's?). I tried the red pepper and jalepeno ones. 

They also have shug. For those of you that don't know, shug is incredible. It's so spicy and amazing and no falafel/hummus feast is complete without it, yet it's annoyingly hard to find here. Hummus Xpress has deliciously fiery lovely shug that made my day. 

Overall, great place to check out and hopefully they open more locations!"}
{"text":"A friend of ours recommend this place, otherwise we probably would never even have known it existed. Now, it's easily turned into one of our favorite restaurants.

We went in not having any idea how the ordering process was going to work. The menu is a little confusing, because it's different, but the guy at the counter could tell we were newbs so jumped right in to help us out. Basically, you can choose from a couple different plates that are $5 or less, or start with a larger plate or bowl and add stuff to it from there. You end with sauces, and if you are vegan they label which you can eat.

I got the Hummus with Falafel. You get to choose up to two kinds of hummus and add all the topping you want (there are loads of interesting toppings to choose from). The falafel was AMAZING. Not dry and pasty at all. Hot and crispy on the outside and oh so light and fluffy on the inside. Some of the best I've had. The hummus was smooth and flavorful. I ended up with an amazing amount of food for less than $5! 

My boyfriend got the gyro meat with herbed sweet potatoes with all kinds of other awesomeness. When it came time to eat, he said he couldn't get it into his face fast enough. So good!

He had a fountain drink and I made an Arnold Palmer with their unsweetened flavored iced tea per the guy at the counter's recommendation  (I think it was a peach lavender tea or something like that - it was very good and they also had a black tea and mint one too).

We'll be returning for sure. The people were incredibly nice and the food was affordable, of great quality and had great flavor. Quite the little gem in a city that feels like it is busting at the seams with Mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"this place is like a greek chipotle. you can be an healthy or unhealthy as you would like, but everything is great! its quick and easy and great for a quick fresh lunch. i would definitly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"A little expensive for the food and it seemed like the food has been sitting out there for quite a while. The vegetables were soggy and very salty especially the eggplant. The hummus selection was good though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go. The staff is very friendly and always making great recommendations for the perfect dish. The food itself is truly delicious, and there are so many options to try for a low cost."}
{"text":"Good, decent, fast Mediterranean food. You can mix and match your plate or bowl with many different types of meats, hummus, and salad. 
Good for on the go if you're craving Mediterranean food. Mind you that if they have a slow day, it may be sitting for a few in the warmers so you won't get that freshly cooked meat that you would get a sit down restaurant. 

Staff is very nice."}
{"text":"The food is very good to the point of being unique.  

You can get most of what is served here elsewhere, if you stop at several different restaurants, but I think you'd be hard pressed to find a single place that does what Hummus Xpress does.

This is the third or fourth time I've been here but  it occurred to me today that if you're one of those people who doesn't like their food touching this might not be the place for you since everything kind of goes into one big pile.  Frankly it makes for some very interesting flavors, but it may not be for everyone."}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff. Experience is like Chipotle. You select what items you want in your bowl. Very tasty. Gluten free selection is good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was really good. Lots of great choices, great service and really fast. I ordered the hummus bowl with falafels. Everything was good. i like the orginal hummus the best. I will go back"}
{"text":"Nice spices: especially love the carrots, kale, and broccoli. Good portions. Friendly service. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I am soooooooooooooooooooooooooo excited about this place!! Quick and delicious! Just as another reviewer described, it's like the Mediterranean  version of Chipotle. You do order from right to left, you get to pick your rice, meat and veggie, hummus and as many toppings as you would like (like olives, and, other things... yeah, I was only interested in the olives) 

I was actually expecting the food not to be too fresh since it's basically served buffet style, but it was surprisingly fresh and perfect! I had the gyro meat and I honestly think it's the best gyro meat I've had in Tempe so far. Super moist and flavorful and it didn't give me indigestion! The hummus was really good, I had the plain one (If someone can't make plain hummus right, then there is no point in trying the flavored ones) It was good!!! I asked if it was made in house or bought, they told me everything is made in house.

Even the drinks were exciting! I had lavender-peach tea. It was fresh and I loved that it wasn't sweetened. Don't forget to check in and get a free tea! 

This will definitely be a regular lunch spot for me....how can you beat cheap, fresh and delicious?"}
