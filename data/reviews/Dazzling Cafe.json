{"text":"Dazzling cafe will definitely dazzle (sorry) you when you first step in. 
the decor, borderline outlandish, will definitely be a conversation starter - from the pink walls to the bunny eared chairs and waitresses dressed in maid attire. 

We came here for their signature desserts and ordered a Black Chocolate Honey Toast.  - It had three layers of inch thick toast stacked on top of each other, drizzled with cream (the consistency of it reminded me of eating melted marshmellows without it being overtly sweet).  I was a bit disappointed by the single scoop of ice cream that topped our carbohydrate tower since it was simply not enough to accommodate for all that bread that was given! 

Vanilla Ice Cream Waffle - the waffle was pretty good!  Although they are known for the Honey Toast, I think most of us at the table thought the waffle was the better option.  

I can see why this place is quite popular in Taiwan and even in Hong Kong considering it offers a spacious, and quirky environment for people to catch up/ hang out which is something hard to come by in Asian countries due to the lack of space from the population density.  However, being in Canada where space is much more abundant, I feel there are other better dessert options available considering their signature honey toast is something I can easily conjure up  and perhaps make a better version? (and not have to pay +15$ for) at home  where I can also invite friends over in an equally comfortable setting to enjoy.   

I wouldn't mind coming back again if my friends were eager to visit again, but I feel dazzling cafe is a place where you try once for the 'trend' factor and probably wont frequent in the long run."}
{"text":"great place to have afternoon tea with besties. love the bunny ear chair. pasta and honey bread are my favourite."}
{"text":"good environment and good food

very good for photo taking and friends hang out.


highly recommend to go with yoyr first date to impress your dates"}
{"text":"Since they opened i have always come here for my dessert cravings (if im near yf/ys) their service is good and presentation of their food is by far the prettiest of all !! No complaints ! Yummy good"}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks. My favourite is the honey toast dessert. The environment and service is perfect for friends gathering. I will definitely visit again! :)"}
{"text":"This place is the worst cafe I've been to. Mans weren't patient, mans other customer swore at us, mans patient levels were low af, mans had bad customer service and mans even brought the wrong order, ALSO mans didn't bring all the orders @ the same time. The only good thing about this place is taking pics, mans don't even deserve 1 star."}
{"text":"When you first walk into this place, it seems like an English afternoon tea cafe.  It's actually a cafe from Taiwan and part of a restaurant chain.

The food is very very very average, it's like average food dressed up in tuxedo, every drink has been dressed up with flakes of roses, fancy eh?  The chicken spaghetti was ok, although could be better if it was more flavourful.    The lychee strawberry drink that I got was nothing more than lychee juice you could buy from supermarket dressed up fancy with rose flakes.

Service was good and prompt, they even cut the toast for you.   The dinning time is 90 minutes maximum so it's not a place to chill for a long time.

The cafe gives good first impression with its design and feel but it lacks good food to compliment it."}
{"text":"The decor and setting is nice and cute.  It's a great place for hanging out with friends and take food photos."}
{"text":"Would you pay for your dinner at a sit down restaurant before your food even came? Apparently they thought it was an acceptable thing to ask. Came here to dazzling cafe for dessert with a group of friends, we each ordered a waffle and a drink (which btw they did not have Mont Blanc cream available, and would not allow special requests like taking out the red bean from the red bean matcha dessert because it has to look identical to their pictures?! - weird). So we aren't off to a good start, then about 10 to 15 mins later the waitress comes by and asks us if we want separate or one bill. Thinking it might be a mistake we said oh we didn't even receive our food yet, and the waitress says oh yes i see, mumbles awkwardly and then says would you like to pay for the bill now? 
Well no. We don't. I'd like to eat first and enjoy my meal, or perhaps at the rate they apparently make waffles - I might not get it. 

Long story short - service is terrible, food took forever (seriously are you milling the flour back there? How long does it take to make a waffle? - there was only 4 tables!), food was mostly cream. It's expensive and I'd say Pastel crepes and waffles are much better and cheaper as well. I'm pretty sure any bubble tea place or even Phoenix cafe can make the waffle just as good. Save your money and go to another dessert cafe - overpriced here."}
{"text":"I was very surprised to see no line out the door when I visited Dazzling Cafe this past weekend. This cafe is widely popular in Taiwan, and the line-ups there are usually insane (or maybe people just enjoy queues there!). 

The interior decor and vibe brought me back to my home country, and the menu is pretty much the same as well. Service is cheery and our orders arrived pretty fast. 

The Taiwanese popcorn chicken was one of the more authentic ones I've tasted in Toronto, so it'll definitely be a staple when I visit again. The chicken thigh basil pesto pasta I ordered was not the best, but the truffle mushroom rice was delicious (especially if you are a cheese lover). 

Of course, we had to order the honey toast - we opted for the hazelnut option. The size is not as large as the honey toast I've had at Petit Potato, but we could never finish that anyway. If you instagram or post on Facebook a picture of the honey toast, you receive 10% off your bill! 

Overall, Dazzling is an incredibly cute cafe - perfect for catching up with girlfriends and to indulge in Instagrammable desserts!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing establishment. 
The decor is supposed to be cute and charming, but the chair I sat in felt like it was going to break when I leaned back slightly. The white cushions, chairs and floor had hair from past customers. Not a good impression from the get-go.

The hazelnut milk tea was full of sugar. The brick toast with red beans and matcha had WAY too much whipped-cream, and barely any red beans.  The three-layered toast is made to impress in photos and not the taste buds. 
 
Finally, the prices are skyrocket high for what you get."}
{"text":"The main foods are in small portions, taste are just ok!The dessert is more delicious and it's stacked it so pretty! However, I wish the toast bread could be a bit softer. The atmosphere and decoration are so awesome. The services are more like a one man show on Sunday around lunch time . It Took so long for the server to deliver the food to us (the kitchen had already ring the bell to let the server know the food was ready)because she was busy with another customer! Please reconsider If you are planing to bring young kids in. My kids accidentally dropped the glass and they made us pay. It's NOT a children friendly environment. Price is around $10-20 per plates. Drinks are around $8. Overall I might NOT return again."}
{"text":"\"meh\" can pretty much summarize my thoughts of this cafe. I mean, they're not terrible but I wouldn't say their good either or we just ordered the wrong things.

We ordered two brick toast (one green tea & red bean, the other vanilla) and it was exactly what it is. Brick toast with stuff on it. The toast was little on the dry and dense side compared to other brick toast I've had. 

I really like the decor of the place. Super cute and girly. The washroom is upstairs which I find inconvenient."}
{"text":"extremely disappointed! over-priced, poor quality of food, period."}
{"text":"This was definitely an experience to try this. It was good at first, but it is very very sweet and it continues to taste the same. There's also lots about it itself that you can't / or is hard to eat."}
{"text":"OMG I love this place! The service is excellent. Food is super delicious. My friends and I will defiantly come back:D"}
{"text":"Decor is cute. Sadly, that's the only redeeming quality for this cafe. If you're not ready to commit any excessive amount of time just waiting, and waiting, and waiting, then this place is not for you.

Waffles - out of stock. Recommended green tea toast - out of stock. That's pretty much 70% of their dessert menu. Came here after dinner at Nome across the street, and everything we came here for was out of stock.

How does a dessert cafe even run out of waffles? I'm no pro chef by any measure, but even I can make waffles with limited materials.

Popcorn chicken is roughly 30% MSG and 70% chicken.

Caramel chicken wings sound sweet, but it's basically just regular wings. Interestingly, the fried flower decorations were significantly sweeter than the thin caramel coating. Why didn't we just stick with Dazzling Cafe's specialty and order? Oh right. Sold out.

So we've been here 30 minutes, and the only thing we've seen are the popcorn chicken and caramel wings. If I wanted to eat chicken, I'd go to a chicken specialty store. Please. I came for dessert, not dinner.

To be fair, even though we've been waiting for an unreasonable amount of time for the difficult for the food, I can definitely say the seats are fairly comfortable.

The French honey toast is literally a piece of toast and probably a pound of cream. There's a decorative scoop of off-flavoured vanilla ice cream. Really? Took 45 minutes so they can make One piece of toast, and an insane ratio of cream to toast at that.

At the time of writing, they have a promotion: spend $30 get 30 minutes of parking, spend $60 get 60 minutes of parking, spend $100 and get.. 90 minutes of parking. Well, heads up. You'll still be waiting for food at 90 minutes.

The Mont Blanc honey toast was less exciting than our expectations. I don't even understand how it took so long to make this barely decorated piece. The staff asked us to pay before the food even came because they wanted to clean up 45 minutes before closing.

Honestly, if they didn't spend so much money on the decor, they might have had enough money to hire a decent chef or pastry master.

Thank you for reading.

Summary: definitely do not come here. If you're a tourist, this is a cute place for photos, but there is literally nothing tasty here. I'm serious."}
{"text":"Slow and overpriced for what they offer. Like really bad. I don't understand the hype."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently visited the new dazzling cafe which opened up in a North York close by where we live. Having read reviews of how popular the chain is in Taipei, we came in with high expectations. As we were instructed there was a one order minimum per customer, I reluctantly ordered the blue citrus lychee mojito while my husband ordered the strawberry and ice cream waffle which was delicious."}
{"text":"Two days before my visit, I called and ask them for reservation (2 people) to avoid long wait time, and they said \"Reservation only available for a group of 4+ people and if you come at 5 pm sharp (they open from 5 pm - 12 pm ), you will be fine\". So I did, got there at 5 pm with my friend and all the customers standing in front of the host without a proper lineup, waiting to be seated. Since there is no lineup, people came after me got registered before me ?I am unhappy about this). At the time I got registered, they told me it is going to be 20 min wait, which it is ok. 5 minutes after, they came back and said the wait time will be longer and they will try to get me a table at 6 pm (This is a joke! You said 20 min and now 1 hour wait time? We paid for the parking already!). We decided to wait because their Honey Toast is well known in Taiwan. Fine, we will see how good is the honey toast?

We ordered Honey french toast with vanilla ice cream - $13.99, Poached egg and fried chicken waffle with cheese - $12.99, Roasted chicken leg spaghetti with basil pesto sauce - $15.99, Rose lychee soda- $7.5 and Dazzling pearl- $7.5. 
This visit costs total $60 ~ $70 for 2 girls (2 drinks, 2 main courses, and 1 toast).

Overall the drinks just mix of syrup in different flavors, and extremely sweet. However, the drinks look nice in the photo.

Honey toast with vanilla ice cream is overpriced $13.99. The toast is slightly more texture than regular white toast from a supermarket. 

The only recommendation is the Poached egg and fried chicken waffle with cheese. The chicken was crispy, almost dry but I like the poached egg. 

Dazzling cafe is worth it if they have promotion or discount. Otherwise, this is going to be my visit once in a lifetime."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in, the decor is adorable and loving in my first impression. This is a chained store came from Taiwan, Asia.  

We were seated the table we would like as the server staffs greeted us politely.  The atmosphere is 1 star service is 1 star, their signature dishes are desserts and pasta. We ordered a salad, a pasta and a dessert.

The dessert which we ordered was not available And our server apologized and explained to us because the toaster was malfunctioning. It was disappointing thus  We had to find something else since we craved for something sweet. 

Food quality is 4/5 
Drink quality is 5/5
Service 5/5
Parking 2/5 there is free parking only if u spend over $50 or partial reimbursement to your bill depends on how much you spent. Otherwise taking Public transit maybe a better idea to save yourself money. 
Cleanliness 4/5 

Overall, our experiences are wonderful and rewarding. Surprisingly, the manager came by to get us the bill and she inquired our feedback about food and service.  We told her how disappointed we cannot taste the dessert we originally ordered. Then guess what. This is a very professional manager who asked for feedback and kindly offered what made us disappointment ... wow she gave us a free dessert coupon for next visit . We were very happy because of their service and their care to customers like us.  Yes!! We will return to try again and get the coupon redemption.  Thanks Dazzling cafe manager and staffs who made us such a better first Taiwan cafe experience and we appreciated how your store honoured the customers feedback. Great store great business management"}
{"text":"Poor service - ordered a dessert toast that never arrived. Asked after waiting for 30 mins to the same waitress & she blamed that we didnt order it. It was the first item we ordered for 3 ppl. 3 drinks & 1 dessert. She also could barely communicate in english. Food and drinks are mediocre for a hefty price tag. Will not come back"}
{"text":"Honestly the food was very underwhelming. 

On a weekday dinner, we were the only ones in the restaurant. Even though my visit was 2 months ago, I can still remember them playing rock music that did not suit the ambiance of the restaurant at all. There were 5 of us so we tried a variety of dishes - the chicken wings, spaghetti, curry, risotto, udon, crepe and matcha toast (i think). Honestly everything was below average except maybe the curry and crepe. The risotto was too cheesy, chicken wings were try and basically just had goops of sauce put on top, and the cream on the toast felt very artificial. I hope this doesn't set the standard for Dazzling Cafe, as i've been to the dazzling cafes in Taiwan and it is much much better than this."}
{"text":"The entire cafe is really cute and \"girly\".  Apparently, each one of their Dazzling Cafe locations is decorated in a different theme.  For this one, it was a pink and gold theme and I saw some Hello Kitty plushies on the counter of their bar too.  As well, the backs of the chairs had rabbit ears on it which was really cute.  There was also a white merry-go-around horse near the entrance of the cafe.

I chose the Rose Lychee Soda which turned out to be not only pretty in its looks but taste as well.  It was a sweet soda that tasted flowery and also refreshing.

The Bacon and Poached Egg Spaghetti was a beautifully assembled dish where the pasta strands were twisted so perfectly with a poached egg on top of it.  It smelled so good too.  After poking the yolk, the egg contents unleashed upon the pasta.  I really enjoyed the texture and firmness of the spaghetti.  I was actually pleasantly surprised with how good the spaghetti tasted!

The Mentaiko Fries were a very unique item where crunchy and crispy French fries were topped with mentaiao, or pollock roe.  It smelled amazing and this was the first time that I had mentaiko with fries like this.  Everyone at the table loved it.

The Fried Caramel Chicken Wings piqued my interest when I saw these on the menu.  These were nicely fried chicken wings covered with caramel sauce although I didn't think that the caramel taste was too obvious.  These were also a hit though and we got a second order of these.

The Roasted Chicken Leg Spaghetti with Basil Pesto Sauce had the same spaghetti as the first pasta dish.  The basil pesto sauce smelled amazing and was pretty good.  The roasted chicken leg was firm and reminded me of the ones at Hong Kong style cafes.  It was decent though and not too firm or rough.

I really loved the Truffle Mushroom Pizza.  This was full of cheese that tasted so, so good.  The crust of the pizza wasn't thick at all and very thin.  It went so well with the gooey cheese.  

The Jalapeño Chicken Pizza was definitely spicy as the menu said.  It was quite good though and the spice packed a lot of (surprise) heat.

This Hazelnut Chocolate Honey Toast was so delicately and carefully crafted.  It was layers of brick toast with strawberries on the side of it in a diagonal fashion.  There was whipped cream on top of it with swirls of chocolate too.  After we took photos of it, the server actually helped us cut it open and divide it.  Apparently, there was a special way to do it!  After she took apart the top, inside of the honey toast, there were smaller cubes of toast already cut up and dosed with butter.  She dunked each cube into the whipped cream with strawberry before serving each person with it with the tongs that were provided.  This was so precious!  Tt was like the dessert had a mini treasure chest.

After we ate the little cubes of toast, we were then welcome to cut up the rest of the honey toast too to eat.  It was so good and I was very impressed that the honey toast stayed crunchy and dry throughout.

The Matcha Red Bean Waffle unique from the regular waffle dessert because each cup area of the waffle held a dollop of whipped cream with the large scoop of matcha ice cream in the middle of the waffle \"flower\" and some red bean on top too.  It was just beautiful.  Whoever thought of this dessert deserves an award.  

I'm actually not a huge waffle fan but when I taste good waffles, I acknowledge it right away.  With that said, I was so, so impressed with the quality of this waffle dessert!  The waffle petal that I had was so moist, well done, and it must be attributed to the batter because I think a lot of waffles out there might be too dry.

The Honey Toast Cups was a similar dessert to the Honey Toast except that this one was in take-out form.  The cubed honey toasts were fit artfully into a plastic cup and layered with whipped cream, and the flavours or fruits of the cup that you chose.  We got to try the Mango Honey Toast Cup and Strawberry Lower Honey Toast Cup.

Everyone loves mango (I'm sure) and the Mango Honey Toast Cup definitely didn't disappoint.  The mango was so smooth and sweet.  Again, the most surprising thing was that even though the cubed toasts were put into this cup squished with whipped cream and fruits, they remained so crispy and dry.  The toasts were the best part of this dessert for sure.

The Strawberry Lover Honey Toast Cup was just as good if you like strawberries."}
{"text":"Dazzling Cafe is getting a whopping four stars for two reasons: the decor and the honey toast.  Every other aspect is negligible for being average/decent.  

Dazzling Cafe in Toronto is a must when you're in the North York region.  Located just across from Whale, HCafe, Love Me Sweet, and other notable dessert joints, Dazzling Cafe is a wonderland in its own right.  Once you enter, you will be instantly transported to what some would call an adult-sized doll house. Pink and white is the default colour palette here among other pastels.  Your eyes - and subsequently your camera - will follow the unicorn that greets customers at the front, the chairs that have been architctured as white rabbits, the jars of pastel marshmallows, the Tweety Bird apron on display, the glamorized cushions, the Hello Kitty collection on the top shelf, and the dessert-themed wall decals.  Even the music playing in the background is a siren of Alice in Wonderland!  It really is quite dazzling!

The cafe is, in all fairness, a Taiwanese style cafe that has upped the ante. The menu mainly consists of teas, espressos, smoothies, slushes, soups, light entrees, pastas, and one page of waffles and honey toast.  We tried the deluxe matcha chocolate smoothie, summer mango honey toast, clam chowder, and the Hawaiian bacon pizza.  All of the aforementioned items were a dollar or two pricier as well as smaller in size than what you could get elsewhere, all except for the honey toast.  You may be wondering how the cafe got its dreadful Yelp rating.  Well, my gut feeling is that people went in expecting a menu that was just as dazzling as the decor.  No, that's the wrong way to enjoy yourself here.  My advice is to frequent here for dessert only, and by that I mean come with a small group of friends to share a honey toast. We were a party of five and our summer mango honey toast was a good size for sharing.  In fact, a family  across from us got the Mont Blanc honey toast and it also came out as a super-sized buttery loaf of toast with cream, fruits, sauces, and ice cream on top.  Don't worry, if you're not sure how to eat the toast, the staff will cut it up for you. With the toast being like a treasure chest, you open up each layer of the bread to reveal the cubed toast  inside, which you dip into the cream, fruits, ice cream and other toppings.  It will taste crispy, buttery, creamy, and sweet all at once, playing a melody of flavours on your tongue.  My group and I were so blown away by the toast that we all declared it to be the best honey toast that we've had, even compared to those in South Korea.  You could say the flavour was just that dazzling!

Dazzling Cafe hits the right chord for being trendy and extraordinary with their honey toast.  I highly recommend coming here for dates, birthday meals, and hang outs with friends.  Parking in this busy area may be a concern, but if you're lucky, you'll find free public parking in the residential streets.  Remember, have your cameras ready."}
{"text":"Went with a huge group of folks.  Ordered the fried toast with chocolate ice cream.  It was just okay, looks better than it tastes.  

Feedback from others is that the savoury food items is not that good, but the dessert items were \"okay\".  The latte I ordered was alright as well."}
{"text":"Definitely one of those places you go for the experience and aesthetic pictures. The food is not too bad. It's pretty good. The pizza is my favourite! Be prepared to spend cuz the food is pricy!"}
{"text":"We came here for emcee meetup prior to my wedding. It was nice cafe as it has free wifi and you can plug in your lap top near the window seat. You can call ahead to make reservations. 

As you enter, it feels like being back at Taipei, with the pink ears and the white pony/horse near the entrance. The whole theme is very Audrey Hepburn'esque! The pasta were surprisingly pretty decent for a cafe. I've ordered the truffle rice, it was not bad. The lychee soda was a bit sweet even after I was told by the waitress that I should stir it. 

I've also noticed there are discrepancies between the online menu and the one is the restaurant. For example, they don't have the spaghetti with truffle and various mushrooms. A little disappointing as I love truffle and didn't rice casserole.

Then I've ordered a hot tea (try to look on the online menu) again I cannot find it on there. They added apples on there, which did not go well. However they did exchange it for me. Overall, good ambiance, worth a try if in the area. Note I saw they are preparing to open another one at the little plaza surrounding the Langham square plaza."}
{"text":"When comparing the over the top & very eccentric, unique decor, the food and drinks (taste wise) are extremely underwhelming, and dare to say below than average."}
{"text":"We arrived at 9:45pm on a Saturday night and though the cafe closes at 11:00pm, we were told there was no food available and we could only order crispy toast out of the numerous dessert options.  I was already not impressed.  A few minutes after our food arrived, we were given our bill and told there was no rush, however 15 mins later the server returned to collect payment.  The lava cheese crispy toast was warm but not hot enough to make the cheese gooey.  I didn't experience the \"lava\".  The vanilla ice cream served on top was extremely hard (definitely not freshly scooped), but paired well with the toast.  The cafe is clean and Instagrammable with its cute décor and pink bunny-ear chairs.  Service was pleasant, despite the distinct feeling they were trying to rush us out of there.  Perhaps they had more exciting St. Patrick's Day plans than we did."}
{"text":"There is a minumun order per head rule here which is not listed anywhere in the store. Rip off never come back again."}
{"text":"Yes it's a chain but does look cute! It's new so fairly clean. Drinks are beautifully crafted and attractive fresh colors. Even the chopped up fruit bits on top of the drinks look freshly sliced/diced.  Effort was even made to apply a glaze to the grape decor on the drink to give it the dewy fresh look. (Yes I noticed because I'm a pastry chef). 

Only had drinks and the matcha ice cream toast. Toast was beautifully presented with table side service.  Could have used a little more filling but was ok. 

Saw other tables order pasta and other savory items which had beautiful clean presentation but not sure how it tastes. 

Prices are a little higher than shops along yonge sheppard/finch by maybe $1-$2 but you have to account for location. There isn't another dessert place in the immediate area. 

I would definitely go back with friends. 

One thing to improve on...don't assume everyone speaks Mandarin/Taiwanese.  Ask first or go with English."}
{"text":"This is a Taiwanese tea shop with French style decor. I came here for lunch on Saturday even having read all the reviews that didn't seem to be happy with this place. The interior is bright and airy in pastel colours. The menu options are limited for lunch but there is a selection for appetizers and mains mostly salads, pastas and rice casseroles. We ordered the Taiwanese popcorn chicken, cheese fries, roasted chicken with basil pesto pasta, mushroom truffle rice casserole. For drinks I ordered the pineapple earl grey tea comes in a pot, and a strawberry mocha latte. The tea came in a white ceramic pot and had pineapple syrup flavour with some pineapple bits but I couldn't taste any earl grey at all. When I looked inside the tea pot there were no tea leaves so it was either brewed separately or just mixed. The popcorn chicken was tasty but heavily seasoned as they usually are. Cheese fries was a Mexican chili bean sauce sweetened with cheese whiz on top. The roasted chicken basil pasta was not bad big portion of chicken nicely done. Pasta was as expected for these types of places. The mushroom rice was very cheesy and the rice could've been cooked longer was slightly hard but overall ok. We ordered the strawberry ice cream waffle and the waffle was fresh and crispy. Ice cream was single scoop with strawberry slices and cream (not freshly whipped). Tasted ok for a sweet dessert. Washrooms were nice and clean upstairs. They have high chairs and children's plates and utensils. Service was good, there was only 2 other tables. Parking was free the gate was up behind on the lot for this unit. Overall standard Taiwanese tea shop with limited menu with mediocre taste but good option for leisurely  sit down for drinks and snack. They need to include more menu items and change the chef to keep this place going. It is quite expensive but with the right changes it might have potential. Not sure I would return in its present state."}
{"text":"Dazzling Cafe lacks anything resembling dazzle, and potentially anything resembling an actual cafe.

Came in with a party of four for dessert and were seated upstairs in a quiet little area with a handful of other tables. After a few minutes looking at the menu filled with expensive drink choices and an appallingly small number of choices for dessert, I settled on ordering a royal earl grey milk tea, and the rest of my party ordered drinks and a single pasta dish.

I'm not sure why it took as long as it did to make the four drinks we had ordered, but two of the drinks were completely wrong (entered incorrectly by the server) and took another 20-25 minutes to appear correctly.

In addition, we were charged for the incorrect drinks and the correctly ordered drinks after that, but after a bit of cajoling, the staff finally gave us the correct bill with a 10% discount for our troubles. That was the one nice part of the night.

The food was forgettable, the drinks were average at best (at not average prices), the decor was borderline ridiculous, and the service was bad all around.

Frankly, this place doesn't live up to its name, and the only dazzle I had experienced was in just how much worse they were than my low expectations.

Don't come here, go elsewhere for better food and drinks."}
{"text":"Food is decent but serving is so little. I feel that the dishes are over priced. The ambiance is very cute but it doesn't seem very authentic. The service is good and attentive. I got the salmon panini and strawberry fried toast. Both were good but I really feel I can find a different restaurant that offers better quality and serving portions for the same price. Nonetheless, I don't regret going and trying their food out."}
{"text":"Very fancy place and insta-pics place for sure. But overpriced for the quality. It was just tons of cream and cream...I guess their toast is for share, at least 2 and even can go up to 4ppl if you comes here for desert only. I think drink is also overpriced for the quality. This place is all about how they present their food. Definitely worth if you care about your Instagram or social media pics. But not my often-go place."}
{"text":"I visited Dazzling Cafe with a friend of mine after a very filling dinner and we ordered a drink each (kiwi slush and pina colada) as well as a month blanc toast. 

My friend had huge expectations for the toast but was very severely disappointed... We got huge lumps of whipped cream and ice cream and very little actually chestnut cream. To add to the displeasing experience, the outside of the toast was not toasted, making the whole outer layer of the toast tough and not edible. 

Drinks were a bit too sweet for our liking and tasted very much like syrup. My kiwi slush was made mostly with canned or kiwi syrup and a very few chunks of real kiwi.

Overall, its quite gimmicky, very pricey and not too yummy."}
{"text":"Nice place and nice service. They welcome you with a smile and serve you with a smile. Besides their rose coffee is the best in the town . Honestly I tried many rose coffee but they serve the best ."}
{"text":"When you're in the mood to sit in a room of pink, think dazzling cafe. We ordered the rosa latte, which came with rose petals. The drinks and desserts were super sweet, so come prepared to leave with a sugar headache - worth it? I'm not sure. But the bunny chairs were nice"}
{"text":"Decor and interior is pretty, clean, and cute. Toasts are definitely the wow factor and their drinks are delicious. Pastas not so much. Tried a couple of the pasta dishes and they were lacking taste. They were very mediocre and would not really recommend. Price is on the expensive side (eg. pastas $13.99+ and portions are smaller than what you get at pubs). On slow days/hours (around 5-6pm) service is good. Waitresses are friendly. During busy hours (after 6pm) service is slower but I appreciate the workers for doing their jobs well. I would go again only for their pink decor."}
{"text":"Average food. 3 of us on our lunch break decided to go down for a quick dessert / snack. After we ordered we were told it was a one order per person minimum. Which we all found outrageous. Everything on the menu was over priced. So we decided to order some milk teas the hazel nut and the original. We all sampled them the teas were really bad especially the hazelnut tea. 
Don't think we will ever return back."}
{"text":"My first thought was... \"not another Taiwanese restaurant opening up!\" and we finally decided to have dinner there because we had $5 off. Yelp wasn't very good with helping me decide what to order but I always tend to go with what I don't/can't make at home so I ordered the pork jowl and pesto pasta (and my bf ordered the duck breast orange zest pasta). I was pleasantly surprised with the food and how much effort it took to come up with the ingredients in the dish. The pasta was not just pasta + a sauce; mine was enlaced with bell peppers, mushrooms and zucchini, and topped off with parmesan and walnuts. We also ordered the new chocolate crispy lava toast as opposed to the honey toast (too much for 2 ppl) and that had a great balance of texture and flavour. Both dishes were presented very nicely. Service was also great; everyone was very attentive. Also, I walked in with a coupon and came out with another couple because they were having a promotion on their honey toast. Since we ordered the crispy toast instead, the coupon was for our next visit."}
{"text":"I loved this place because it was like my childhood dreams come true. Everything is pastel coloured and the chairs have rabbit ears.

The cafe speaks true to its Asian counterparts. I've been to exactly the same type of cafes and it's about the same type of cute and slightly classy vibes.

Foods runs a bit on the sweet side so you can ask them to reduce the sugar in drinks. (Only possible for some drinks). The pasta is very Asian-style and everything looks great for instagram. The pizzas are surprisingly decent, I would recommend them. All desserts are okay in taste, nothing special but so photogenic.

Most girls seemed to be impressed and look very happy here, so you can bring someone on a date or afternoon tea."}
{"text":"This place was super disappointing. There is minimum one order per person rule. We had just came from dinner and was looking to share something, but each had to order something. We ordered the strawberry waffle & chocolate waffle, hazelnut milk tea & Carmel milk tea. The interior of the place was cute and charming. Once the drinks arrived they were both overwhelming sweet. The waffles was topped with excessive amounts of whip cream. Every mouthful was just whip cream. The chocolate waffle, had scoop of ice cream that was also wrapped around in whip cream. This place is definitely only about presentation and not the substance ."}
{"text":"The Dazzling Cafe is yet another Taiwanese chain that is making its way to the Greater Toronto Area. This particular chain is popular in Taiwan and already has locations in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and British Columbia to name a few. When you walk in, you can see where they get their name as it is a rather elegant looking interior that is both modern chic yet has a young vibe to it. The offerings are primarily dessert with a few pasta, pizza, and rice dishes thrown into the mix. And of course, the fruitiest drinks possible.

We went because the wife needed to have dessert as an actual meal. She can't say no. So in we went and off she went. I ordered Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken appetizer as a meal (I know...pathetic). She went with the Strawberry Ice Cream Waffle with a Pineapple soda on the side. 

I'll get the appetizer out of the way. The Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken ($7.99) was subpar. The portion size was small for what the price is. Not asking for much here, but the taste of the chicken was fine. Standard across the board and pretty much exactly like any other Taiwanese place. Would have liked something a bit different if it wasn't going to be better than the rest.

The Strawberry Ice Cream Waffle ($12.99) is definitely large enough for 2 people to share (or one fat lonely man). The ice cream are several scoops that lay across a rather unique looking waffle. They are like little waffle cups that combine into one giant waffle. You could rip off each cup and just have mini ice cream cups topped with whipped cream and strawberry. It was precisely what we did and it was great.

The Pineapple soda drink is pretty pricey ($7.50) for what equates to a glass of pineapple soda. However, they did add some diced strawberries and mint to try to fancy it up a bit. 

Servers adorn maid outfits to help all those fetishists out there. They are quick and efficient but look miserable right now. They're just starting up so hopefully they break out of it. The prices are a bit too high for me. I don't mind shelling money out, but I'd like the offerings to be up to par. Very nice place to bring a date after dinner, but rather standard. Nothing overly special."}
{"text":"Very Gimmicky!! The drinks are too artificial and tastes like syrup. We ordered the kiwi slush which had no real kiwi or kiwi flavour and I felt like I am drinking some kind of artificial syrup. The Taiwanese chicken popcorn was ok. Overall the experience was not great and it's quite pricey. Would not return."}
{"text":"No expectations for food, mainly coming here for the decor which is girly, white and bright. The couch seat is pretty comfortable & makes a nice place to chat. Tried the Mont Blanc Honey Toast - few strips of crispy toast that you eat with cream and chestnut paste, not bad, but the \"ice cream\" looked/tasted more like cream, and obviously overpriced at $15.99."}
{"text":"Plays up the cute presentation and ambiance. Will not come back- overpriced food and drinks, average taste and inattentive confused servers. Much better options in the area...save your money for something else."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan. The food and drinks are pricey here (think sodas at $7.50, french fries at $7.99) and you are required to buy one item per person.

The cafe chairs are cute and service was fast (probably because there were 4 employees working and only 2 tables) but the food was disappointing. 

My strawberry waffle was topped with what looked like cool whip, strawberry jello powder, and an artificial strawberry sauce. The fake taste overwhelmed the 1-2 real strawberries and strawberry sorbet. My panini was filled with toppings traditionally found on a burger (lettuce, tomato, cheese, red onion). It was way too rich, with sauce and tomato juice dripping all over the plate with each bite. The small handful of salad greens had way too much dressing on top to be edible... Was half supposed to be for my fries? The curry with popcorn chicken was the best out of the three: sweet Japanese curry with a strong taste of coconut milk, warm rice, and a small, but crispy portion of popcorn chicken. 

Overall, the pictures were cute and service was fine, but based on the food and price, I'm unlikely to come again."}
{"text":"Im not sure why the reviews are so low. You have to know what to expect here when you come and what to order. The jalepeno chicken pizza was really good! Its simple. But thats ok. Thats what I want. The desserts are pretty much standard waffles and ice cream. But thats what they offer. Get the pizza or pasta and a drink. I would skip the desserts. Go for the cute atmosphere so your girl can take nice insta photos. Lastly, service was on point so I cant complain. 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"it's a nice establishment to visit, especially if your on a date, this is perfect. The prices are reasonable. I got the Chestnut waffle ice-cream just because I've never seen it, it was okay as far as chestnut ice-cream goes. But next time I'd probably try something different, I think the place is more for people to take pictures of the food to post on social media. They even give you quote props to add when your taking a picture. It's definitely a novelty Cafe. I'd recommend anyone to go at least once."}
{"text":"This is a cute place.  Cute decor, chairs with bunny ears, servers dressing as maids..pretty DAZZLING.  I ordered the strawberry waffle - it came with strawberries, small scoop of icecream, and a whole lotta whipped cream.  Overall, it tasted okay, prob won't order it again.  The honey toast looks interesting, I would rather try that instead."}
{"text":"I get what they are trying to do here. But this place isn't really dazzling.

The decor is nice and fresh and very girly and I do like that it is very bright. 

Price is kinda a little more expensive than the usually teahouse, especially the food. 

Their popcorn chicken was decent, not wow. But it was pretty decent. 

Their desserts do go for the WOW factor here, but definitely the taste is missing. I had the waffle, which was ok - but you can tell it wasn't freshly made, which was odd considering it took awhile to get to the table. Plus the whipped cream was artificial tasting.

Overall - this place was ok. But I'll give it a miss and go somewhere else in the the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"Dazzling Cafe glows for attention over the white velvet of snow among the buzzing streets, and colorful led lights. This adorable cafe is perfect for girls night out, and for date nights.

My friend and I ordered  much needed lattes due to the effects of the blistering coldness from the typical Canadian weather. We were excited to try 2 signature lattes from the Dazzling cafe: Rose & Creme Brulee Chestnut Lattes.

While we were patiently waiting for our cute lattes, we also ordered Roasted Duck, along with Chocolate Banana Ice Cream Crepes.

The LATTES were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! The Rose Latte was presented with edible red petals, along with 2 heart-shaped buttered biscuits. The aroma of the latte surprisingly had no smell of coffee, but rather a nice flowery fragrance. However, if you want the less sweeter option, go with the Creme Brulee Chestnut Latte. The top foam of the latte was quite crispy from the caramelized sugar, yet quite creamy from the bottom of the foam.

Our Main courses arrived, and both the crepe was quite flavorful. The Smoked Duck Crepe had notes of vinegar, and sweet mustard. On the contrary, the crepe was quite hard to cut into. Dazzling Cafe should take note!

Head over to Dazzling Cafe, and try their extensive Honey Toast Menu!"}
{"text":"Their honey toast explains this 5 star rating they deserve. It is delicious. I used to think condense milk and toast was the best (which it still is) but this one comes up right next to that!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Very Taiwan Cafe-like
Great for drinks and desserts

Cons:
Not so great for meals

200th review!!!  YAY!!  What better way than a review for a Taiwanese place.  If you've ever been to Taiwan, than you know Dazzling.  It's a pretty famous cafe over there.  I've wanted to try it before, but the line ups are always super crazy and I'm not someone who waits in line for more than 20 minutes, ever.

First think you notice when you walk in is the decor is borderline ridiculous.  Having said that, this is the way cafes are in Taiwan.  There's always a borderline ridiculous motif going on at Taiwanese cafes.  They have a cafe where the motif is the toilet for gosh sakes.  So in terms of authenticity to the Taiwanese cafe, the Dazzling here gets full marks.

We came here for my wife's birthday since she's had her eyes on this place for a while and always wanted to go when she was in Taiwan as well.  We came for a meal and dessert after.  Dazzling's menu has an assortment of categories to choose from.  They have food and dessert items to choose from but you can tell this place is meant for desserts.  We ordered the poached egg pasta, pork jowl rice casserole, and popcorn chicken for dinner. A hazelnut chocolate honey toast was ordered for dessert.

I'm going to be frank here about the food.  It could be a lot better.  You do not want to come here when you're hungry.  The portions are small and the prices are a tad on the high side.  Having said that, the food at least was pretty good.  The popcorn chicken used Chinese 5 spice powder which not many places here do.  It gave it a different taste than I'm used to.  The pork jowl was super tender and very good.  The pasta could of used more sauce.  The food is not horrible, but the portion and price point bring it down.

Desserts and drinks are what makes this place shine.  You won't find any alcohol here but you'll find an assortment of drinks you can find at Taiwanese cafes back in Taiwan.  Our milk teas were done pretty well and the price wasn't too far off what you would be paying here.  They're famous for their honey toast.  When the honey toast came, it looked magnificent.  The servers than gave us tips on how to eat it as well as giving us our first serving.  The honey toast was by far the best part of our meal.  My eldest daughter loved it so much.  

Dazzling is perfect if you just want to come in for drinks and desserts.  It would make a perfect after meal stop for a girls night out.  I would not recommend coming for a meal, specially if you're a big eater.  The service is excellent but the prices are a tad of the higher side.  

If you come to Dazzling knowing what Taiwanese cafes are supposed to be like, you'll enjoy yourself.  If you come thinking it should be like what cafes are like here, you're not going to enjoy it as much."}
{"text":"Not sure why there's so many bad reviews. But based off of my experience here and the food. This cafe is actually pretty good and worth visiting. It is very nicely designed, cute decor, everything's pink and white. I love the chairs here. They are absolutely adorable. They have bunny ears on them. 

As for food. I didn't try the pasta or savoury foods but they looked pretty good and seed pretty reasonable priced. Under $15 a plate. 

I got a strawberry waffle ($12.99), the waffle was delicious. They were hot and fresh and tasted like hk eggie waffle batter. The whipped cream was really creamy with a little sweetness. The strawberries were a little sour but the ice cream made everything complement each other well. One thing that could've been better was if the strawberry ice cream on top was a little creamer. But other than that, I really liked it. 

I also got the lychee rose sparkling soda, $7.50. A little pricey but this one was also pretty good, there was strong lychee flavour with a hint of rose which gave it that rosy lychee flavour. But didn't make the flowery scent too overpowering. 

Last thing we got was the hazelnut milk tea. I also really liked this one. It came in a pot where you can pour 2-3 cups out of it. It was a pretty big portion for the price. The pot was only $5.50. The tea flavour not too strong. You can taste tea but more of the hazelnut. Sweetness level was nicely paired. 

As for service, the service was great. The staff were friendly and attentive. They came around to fill water a couple of times. Desserts came out decently fast. I'd say ignore the negative reviews and try out this place. You'd be surprised, I was surprised. I had a great dining experience, food was good too."}
{"text":"It says it opens from 5PM to 12AM so we went there at 11PM the first time but were told they don't accept order anyone(with pretty arrogant attitude)...Very disappointed but still we went there last week for the second time: Waffle was just so so and the drink was just soda with little fruit slice on the top..The spoons we were provided were blotted and we didn't even use them..They do provide 10% discount if you share their picture on instagram but in all this small benefit cannot offset their bad attitude and unimpressive at all.

Plus: Long waiting time alert: prepared for more than half hour of waiting time"}
{"text":"A very lackluster experience overall. We wanted some dessert and decided to try this place out. It looks appealing if you like pink, bunnies and hello kitty. Except for 2 tables, the whole place was empty. But we still got seated in a table with a direct unappealing  view of the kitchen. Then we decided to order a dessert to share, since we were not too hungry. However, we were told that 2 people means you had to order 2 items. Seriously??? It was an empty restaurant! Anyway, short if leaving, we had to order something. As for the food, I have no idea why people rave about their honey toast. We ordered the chocolate hazelnut honey toasts, and it's just bread with ice cream on top. On the positive, the severs were all polite. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Cute decors... That's all
Drinks and food were over priced for the quality and portion."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place since it was so aesthetically appealing but.. the furniture alone wasn't enough to give this cafe a 'dazzling' vibe. 
The staff were alright, providing somewhat attentive service but were really lacking on any care to their customers. 
The most appealing aspects is definitely the cute decor and the beautifully presented food. 
The waffle was good but it was expensive !! 
The place is beautiful so i would definitely recommend coming here at least once and take pics of the furniture and food !!"}
{"text":"their mentaiko spaghetti with cream sauce is soooo yummy idk what it is but something about it just makes me addicted to it. however super expensive and super small portion but it is just so good. but i think i've had it too many times now i don't crave it as much. everyone should try it at least once. also i'm pretty sure their markham location closed which sucks."}
{"text":"I used to work in that area and I always wanted to check out this place, because of cute Bunny chairs, I guess. So, today was the day!
The place is cute, clean and pinky! :) I loved my matcha crispy honey toast along with royal matcha latte. Everything tasted delicious! The service was great, I have been seating there with my friend for almost 3,5 hours(talking lol) and nobody said anything. Simply loved it! For some people it might be expensive, however, I am not visiting this kind of places often, so it didn't bother me at all."}
{"text":"Fancy and comfortable atmosphere, cute environment. 

Had spaghetti, pesto pizza, strawberry ice cream waffle, and the rose lycee drink. 
Very small portions considering the mid-high prices. Two of us spent 50 dollars without feeling very satisfied. Very over-priced. Taste was so-so, my friend and I was not very impressed. Presentation of the dishes are your typical instagram pictures.  They told us the dining time is max 90 minutes, however the food come out very slow. 

Cute waitstaff with maid aprons. Pink princess-y interior. Very girly and feminine place.  

They open at 5pm.. wish they could open for lunch / afternoon tea times as well."}
{"text":"The good: what a charming and cute place. It is definitely a place to feast your mouth and eyes with. The decor is made to a fine lady's taste, with cute bunny chairs and a white and pink themed room. The drinks were good. 

The food was okay, I can't say it was amazing but it was decent. 

The bad: I thought it was a little pricey for what it is, especially for the toast. The toast was almost $17, and could use more ice cream. I got a pasta and thought it was nothing special. Their pizza is small and was cheesy, but wasn't that great."}
{"text":"The only thing going for this place is the ambiance and the rose latte.

Horrible service. They don't cut the brick toasts, the don't come back to check on you and they give attitude when you ask questions lol.

The waffles were along with the icecream.

I've heard from others Unionville location is way better so i'll give that a try."}
{"text":"It's a very elegant looking cafe. Not something it would be normal to see a bunch of bros hanging out at. No, not at all.

Anyways, I had Mentaiko fries, Mentaiko spaghetti with cream sauce, and the summer mango honey toast.

Mentaiko fries were delicious without a doubt, but not sure they were $9 for potato good.

The mentaiko spaghetti with cream sauce, same thing. considering it was a small portion of carbs, wouldn't pay $13.99 for it again. But not taking price into consideration. good.

Honey toast. Not too big a fan of honey toast. I think it's a bit gimmicky, at the end of the day, it's a few slices of bread, a scoop of ice cream, and 3 chunks of mango for a whopping $17.

It's one of the few times when they healthy option might be cheaper. The food is overall good but I can't justify the prices. Not my cup of tea but at least I gave it a chance."}
{"text":"Disappointing. 


Drinks can taste the powder and waffles are way too thick.


Not recommended."}
{"text":"I went with my two younger daughters and the service was not great.  
There is a min order and they never let us know at reception.  Food is not that great either. Kind of disappointed"}
{"text":"Dazzling Cafe is great for get together especially on a weekday when it is quiet. 

Selections of drinks are interesting and they are all photogenic if you are into food photography. Taste wise is so so and overpriced as it is. 

We shared a Strawberry waffles. I found the dough too heavy. The creamy is too thick for my liking. But it is nicely presented and pretty for the photo.

The cuteness factor might at least worth a visit. I do like the bunny theme, but I am a little bias."}
{"text":"I came here a while ago for a media tasting and was really pleased with both the food and the ambiance. Probably one of the cutest cafes I've been to - perfect for Instagram pictures! Everything is beautifully decorated including the food! Everything I tried was very delicious - despite the small portions. Standout items are the iced strawberry white mocha and the creole chicken & shrimp pasta. They also have beautiful desserts such as brick toasts and crepes. Downside is that they're so pretty that I had to take a billion pics before eating which caused the ice cream to melt 

Had to take a star off for the small portions and high price :("}
{"text":"Food is good. I enjoyed the Taiwanese minced pork. Food is moderate to expensively priced. Desserts are average in quality but hit the spot if you have a sugar craving. However, the service is a abysmal if you intend on getting food or drinks in any timely manner. I've been here three times and it's rinse/repeat the same. You need to ask to have your order taken which takes jumping jack motions. We are seated in a blind spot everytime. Staff are available but aren't paying attention to customers' needs. The bill is the same thing. Prepare to be a cheer leader."}
{"text":"Ready to experience some dazzles? Well, what other places can live up to that expectation other than the actual \"dazzling café?\" This place defiantly plays up the cute presentation and ambiance --- you gotta love the bunny ear chair for Instagram selfies! Food here is better than we expected - even though it mostly considered as a dessert and coffee place, their pasta is exceptional. When you break the raw egg on the top of the pasta, it's just a pure visual-appealing and tasteful experience. We ordered Honey French toast with vanilla ice cream, super satisfying, I think they might actually baked their own bread. Oh, and don't forget to order their Dazzling pearl, the fruit in it is just so refreshing for this weather!"}
{"text":"Wonderful afternoon tea, cute environment, great sweets, a good experience for a summer day laid back!"}
{"text":"Drinks are $7 here. LOOOOOL
Ordered the Earl Grey Pineapple hot tea, Taiwanese popcorn chicken and Bacon Egg Spaghetti (aka faux Carbonara). 

The popcorn chicken was the best dish out of the three things I ordered. It was crispy and not too oily. The drink was alright but overly sweet. 

This place is pretty gimmicky, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Desserts are quite pricey so we opted to order lunch here instead. We got the pink fries/mentaiko fries- our fav item of the day, the mushroom truffle pizza, and a pasta. Everything was decent, but I would probably not come here again as it's pricey for what you get"}
{"text":"The honey toasts were super yummy. Nice girly decor, definitely a great place for girls get together. Not so much for the guys. The pastas were ok, not too special. Service is adequate. I need to come back for the toasts."}
{"text":"-Actual food is average
-Lychee drink was good
-Matcha brick toast was decent. Wish it had more green tea ice cream and less toast. There was also too much cream, and it overpowered the whole dish. 
-Personally thought the strawberry waffle was pretty good, but would have liked less cream and more strawberries or more strawberry ice cream. Rest of the party enjoyed the waffle though. 
-Staff was nice, dessert dishes took awhile to come out though. 
-Nice decoration, good volume. Able to have conversation across table of six without raising voice. 
-Quite expensive for the quality of the food, but it's a cute cafe."}
{"text":"The food and dessert here are actually pretty good. Came here expecting everything to be gimicky. The different pasta sauces were creative and had good depth. I wish some of the dishes had more sauce though. I would really recommend the pasta with bbq chicken thigh.. very good. The waffle thing.. i forget what it was xalled was really crispy and tasty, reminded me of funnel cake."}
