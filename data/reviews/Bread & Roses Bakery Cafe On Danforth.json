{"text":"Great croissants - and my favorite - pear danish. It's delicious! We've bought here many times and the quality is always consistent and the service is always good."}
{"text":"This is my go-to coffee place! I live down the street from B&R, and I love spending an afternoon here sipping coffee, eating macaroons, and getting some work done. 
Lovely staff. :)"}
{"text":"This very delightful establishment serves a mix of simple soup and salad lunches and pastries and coffees. I sat overlooking the sidewalk to have mushroom soup, a butter croissant and a glass of water. The mushroom soup was light, with a slight butter taste to make it sweet tasting. The butter croissant was flaky and soft to the taste.

If you are in search of a simple lunch in Greektown, an alternative to Greek food, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Lovely place! Great for a breakfast when you have time to sit down and enjoy your morning. The displays of fresh baked goods and desserts brightened up the cloudy, rainy day.

I ordered a ham and leek quiche and the woman delivered it to me on a plate after she heated it. Unfortunately I did not have time to eat the quiche there and asked her if I could have it to go. She was nice about it and packed it up for me.

The quiche crust was flaky and not too crumbly, and had the quiche been warm when I did get around to eating it, it would have tasted better. $7-8 for the quiche seemed a little steep; while the quiche was good, it was nothing special.

I will definitely come back here to try their desserts - they look really good!"}
{"text":"Went here when it first opened up, honestly the service was great-- but coming from someone who happily drinks any kind of coffee.... theirs is completely inedible. Truly the worst coffee I've ever had. I ordered a vanilla iced coffee and my friend ordered a drip coffee, there was no amount of vanilla syrup in the world to cover up that taste."}
