{"text":"What can I say, I've ordered three times through uber eats the location is even 10 minutes away and every single time the delivery is quick the food is fresh and not soggy. It's flavourful and great quality! Must try ! Their Tziziki is to die for."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a month- food is delicious here. The owner is very friendly and the portions are great. 
Chicken shawarma is my favourite, but their soup is also good! 
Try it!!"}
{"text":"This place has no idea how to run a business! After placing an order with them through skip the dishes, they first contacted me directly telling me they were out of a dish I ordered. I agreed to replace the item with something else in order to avoid a hassle.
 They said I could replace it with something I already had in my order. I ordered a kabob dish with 3 skewers (ground beef, lamb chops and chicken) and they were willing to replace it with either a separate ground beef dish or a chicken one. I told them I would like one of the sirloin dishes ($3 difference), as I already had chicken and ground beef in my initial order. They made it a hassle by calling skip the dishes and having them call me to charge my card an extra $3! I called the restaurant back to complain about their poor customer service, reminding them that I grew up in a family who has been in the customer service industry my entire life. They then said that they refuse to deliver here and told me I would have to pick up the food myself if I wanted it and that they would never deliver to me. They caused all of this chaos to charge me $3 after having run out of an item I ordered and not thinking they should let skip the dishes know. Not to mention that many people who use apps like skip the dishes do so to avoid over the phone contact. I ordered a meal and ended up talking on the phone for an hour with no food in the end. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. These guys are are clueless about how to run a business! They're cheap and rude to top it off!"}
{"text":"Decided to try food from here due to the good reviews and it was a horrible experience. Used ubereats to order a chicken shawarma plate and Greek salad. In the description for the chicken shawarma plate, it said \"served with seasoned rice and mixed veggies\". What I got was tasteless rice with bland dry chicken and zero veggies whatsoever. Called the restaurant and the lady first said they don't add veggies unless asked for and then said they charge extra for veggies in the shawarma plate. Since when does ANYWHERE charge extra for veggies in a shawarma plate? The description clearly said it's served with mixed veggies. As for the Greek salad, olives and onions were supposed to be included and there were zero olives or onions in the salad. Just tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, and cheese. Ubereats doesn't give you a valid excuse to serve crappy food. Definitely would not order again from this restaurant."}
