{"text":"Very clean Asian restaurant with usual Asian dishes. Lunch specials are affordable ($6-$12 each, includes soup) and they have a large drink selection."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time tonight after having driven by the restaurant many times on my way home. Truly a unique and delicious dining experience. If you want really good Chinese food, then come to Singing Pandas. I'm not much of a fan of Chinese food, and I thought the food here was worth repeat visits, and I'll now be bringing friends and family along to try it too. The staff is excellent with their customer service as well.

Why the friends and family comment? What really set this experience apart was the live entertainment; the \"singing\" is not just a clever name. There is great, live musical entertainment included with your dining experience from 6-8pm. 

In a friendly room with a full bar and tables to accommodate all party sizes, the dining lounge was one of a kind. I can't think of anywhere in AZ that you can get a great meal and see great local musical impersonations and performances, along with songs performed by the tremendously talented owner herself, all for a very reasonable price of dinner. Singing Pandas blows the pants off something you'd pay for at a casino or local theater when you factor in the quality plus the cost. 

Try Singing Pandas today, they even have a good sized and well kept parking lot so the whole experience is easy-going fun."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Really friendly staff. The orange chicken is great! One of the the best in the area."}
{"text":"Food and show were fantastic! I can't recommend this place enough. 

Take out is fantastic too. 

Probably the best Chinese good I've had. Seriously, stop reading and come here."}
{"text":"Excellent food and perfect service. Probably the best service I have received at a casual dining restaurant.  Only down side is the clientele.  Super crowded with families with kids. Lots of screaming babies and kids running around.  Parents control your children (from someone with 2 kids of her own)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service at Singing Panda's is phenomenal! I love to go here after a long day and listen to the entertainment. The servers are all very welcoming and nice. They remain attentive throughout the evening...I've actually never had better service from anywhere..Singing Panda's service is tops!
The food...is another story. It's your basic, run of the mill Chinese food. It tastes no different than what you would get at a fast food Chinese spot. We've tried the crab angels - basic. The chicken egg flower soup - cold. The kung pow chicken - basic. The Singapore rice noodles - the shrimp in this dish was chewy and tasted old. I really wish the food was prepared in a more traditional way so that this place would be the total package. We will go back, but not often. We are there more for the atmosphere than the food."}
{"text":"Unexpected surprise! 
The restaurant  we were planning on going to was closed.  Looked on Yelp and this place had great reviews so we decided to give it a try.  I ordered black pepper chicken and my mom ordered Mongolian beef and vegetable lo-mein. Both dishes we exceptional.  The meat was high quality and veggies fresh.  A plus..live entertainment that was fun. The service was spot on.  Thank you Sherry for a great experience. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"The first few times we went I would have given them a 5 star rating.  The service is still great.  They are alway friendly.  Most of the food is OK, but not as good as before.  The mongolian beef was not good.  It now has a sticky sauce that tastes like burnt teriyaki sauce.  The general Tso's chicken is very good in quality, but lacks flavor.  The moo shu pork is still very good and the hot and sour soup is still very good."}
{"text":"Excellent family owned, family oriented restaurant.  We stopped here after asu graduation and had an excellent meal.  Three apps, two orange chickens, one pork lo mein, one king pao chicken and one happy family.  Well make that two.  One meal, one group of five.  Portions were a little large but looking forward to the leftovers."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food was good, entertainment was great. Owner and entainer was incredibly friendly and her singing was mesmerizing. Make reservations!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried it tonight....the food was marvelous and you can't find better service.  I sure hope it is really successful!

Try it and I am sure you will love it!  Potstickers and Kung Pao Chicken were fantastic!"}
{"text":"We were very happy when Singing Panda opened up. The food was very good. We have returned various times but after awhile the service was not good. The owner does not even talk to the customers only too a few not like at the beginning. My favorite appetizer calamari is not as good as before. Not happy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem. First off it is not very large and is growing in popularity so be aware of that when trying to get a table. The food is fantastic, the portions are very large and the prices cannot be beat. The staff is excellent. This is not a fancy decor place but not a fast-food place either. A family friendly casual-dining atmosphere. There is a dining room and a bar room with the bar room having hi top tables. In the bar room is the entertainment. a gentlemen does costume changes and performs Sinatra, Elvis, etc. Sounds a little corny but he is very good and it is a lot of fun. The last time we were there he did a \"duet\" with a Kermit the Frog puppet and the kids got a big charge out of it. This is now our go-to location for Asian food."}
{"text":"Totally exceeded our expectations   We ordered pan fried potstickers - they were freshly hand made and delish.  For the main course we ordered kungpao and general tso's chicken which were both amazing!!!  The food was easily as good, if not better than PF Changs at probably 1/2 - 2/3 the price.  We also asked for extra spicy and it actually was!!  Ambiance and decor were nice and the service was friendly and prompt.  We will absolutely, 100% be back.  Our new favorite Chinese food!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always on point, the energy is relaxing, family restaurant, entertainment is legit. Been here at least a handful of times. Keep coming back."}
{"text":"We went to Singing Pandas today for lunch. It was our first visit but certainly won't be the last. We're vegetarians and the menu had enough choices for us. We ordered the Spring Egg Rolls to start. We've had these at other restaurants but these were just the best we've ever tasted. We ordered 2 vegetarian entrees and they both were excellent. Even the coffee and the tea were delicious.  

This restaurant is in our neighborhood and I think it will become a favorite of ours.  We look forward to going back often and bringing friends with us. The fact that it also has entertainment Tuesday through Saturday is a plus.  Service was very good. I highly recommend this new restaurant to anyone wanting a reasonably priced dinner, good service, accommodating staff and entertainment."}
{"text":"Glad we found this spot.  The food was good and the service was great.  We enjoyed the entertainment and definitely want to come back and check out the other nights."}
{"text":"Very fresh and flavorful food.  Not the fastest or largest portions,  but definitely a fun spot to stop on the way home from downtown Chandler for the final meal of the evening.

Had to revise this down.  We are now at the one hour mark and still no food. Changed order to go, but now thinking that may have confused the kitchen more.

We've seen at least two tables that came in after us eat,  pay and leave.

Finally got our food after over 1:15.

We haven't given up on Singing Panda and we will be back,  but definitely a first strike for me tonight.  :-("}
{"text":"Loved it! Food was great! First time there and didn't expect the fabulous entertainment. Pianist is unbelievable and the dude who sings and changes his outfit to match the artist is over the top awesome! All wrapped up together it was a great experience. I plan to go back very soon and this time I'm bringing the family!"}
{"text":"Hot and sour soup was good...orange chicken was the best I've had in a looooong time!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Have eaten lunch several times and enjoyed every time.  Got take out once and was dissappointed...food was cold, as though it was made too far ahead.  May have been a fluke but needed mentioning."}
{"text":"I love walking into a Asian restaurant and not get suffocated with that grease smell! The food is super fresh! The staff is really nice and are really concerned with making sure you enjoy your food! The black bean sauce in the chicken and green beans is the best I've ever had.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"the food is average below standard Quality,  I felt the owner is taking advantage of the nature of low income neighborhood we are in...her intention is not good...stay away !"}
{"text":"Large portions, very reasonable prices, and really quite delicious.  This is great American-Chinese food.  Meat seems to be higher quality than a lot of other Chinese restaurants in the area.  A specific warning - the beef chow fun has big pieces of ginger in it!  (I am not a fan, but my mother would approve and tell me to eat it all because it's good for me)  I went on a non-entertainment day but I will be back to check it out."}
{"text":"I was there Saturday night with 3 friends. We have been there several timesnnow and have found it to be consistently good and a fun place to go. Having tried a variety of dishes I have yet to find onetthat hasn't been 
is attentive and friendly. And to top it all off the entertainment makes for a really fun experience.  Adding to the experience is they don't rush you in order to turn tables so you can enjoy both the good food and the entertainment."}
{"text":"I am a fan. After recently moving here and trying a few different Chinese joints, I thought Arizona was just not the place for good Chinese. Then I gave Singing Panda a try, and I'll admit it was really tasty. They clearly use expensive ingredients, the beef and broccoli was real angus beef, the orange chicken was all white meat, no mystery chicken. It was very good. It wasn't that much more expensive than competing restaurants in the area either, I'm not sure how they can afford to order such quality meats, but I am very happy they do. The staff was nice, I am looking forward to trying other items from the menu in the future."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough great things about Singing Pandas. We went Christmas day 1st time, a week after they had opened, so impressed by EVERYTHING we haven't stopped going back.  Not take out...we would rather dine in for all the experience.  Drinks are top shelf, each one better than the next. You need to try them all.  Food. Where do I start....fresh, quality, taste, quantity  ...all amazing.  Lastly is the staff. The owner and her staff aka family, couldn't be anymore friendly. She has shared personal stories... they are so warm, friendly, personable, and really make your dining visit rewarding. Plus Elvis sings! The owner puts on a special show as well. SINGING PANDAS is truly a destination location,  like a getaway in Chandler...an escape from the everyday to something fun, good and economical. Thank for bringing us JOY."}
{"text":"Food is the reason we all enter restaurants. Duh. I can not descibe well enough the superb quality and flavor of every dish my family has tried here. The sizzling rice soup to the green curry chicken and the best egg foo young I  have ever had. The service is supreme! After tonights Tuesday night show with Elvis, Kermit and the owner Sherry herself singing the singing pandas restaurant has firmly established itself as not only my favorite chinese food restaurant but now my favorite restaurant over all. What a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"Awesome place.  We went on a busy night, not realizing they suggest reservations, but they did have an open table for us.  The menu was great - several items that were made unique with their own twist so that it wasn't identical to every other Asian restaurant menu in town.  They have a decent spirits selection with some creative alcoholic drinks on the menu as well.  

Four of us went, and all ordered something different so we could share.  The portions were hefty and they sent us home with leftovers.  All four of us really enjoyed our meals - to be fair, one of us didn't care much for the sauce on the dish, but it wasn't horrible.  The wait staff was very friendly, and great at offering recommendations on appetizers, meal choices, and drinks.  There was not one waitress assigned to us; it was tag-teamed to where whoever was walking by at the moment would ask how we were doing, clear any dishes, etc.  

The entertainment was great!  I wasn't sure that I'd care for it (I go out to eat to EAT, not to be entertained) but it was very good.  The guy singing was very talented, uber cool guy that would actually say a few words and give a little background between every few songs, and even walked through the restaurant a couple times saying \"hi\" and shaking hands (if you wanted) while singing.  It might have been a little on the loud side (not ear-piercing loud, just to where we had to raise our voices to have a table conversation loud) but not awful at all.  

We were so impressed, that we went back for lunch a couple days later - it was equally as tasty (no singing at the time, which was fine with us).  Glad we went back, and I'll be hitting this place again.  

In summary, the food was great with some variations of the \"usual\" Asian dishes; the staff was highly attentive and courteous, and the entertainment was actually worth sitting around after dinner and having a couple extra drinks for."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service and the entertainment was fun! I would recommend this as a restaurant to sit back, relax and enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese in the area hands down. A lovely staff and great entertainment. The crisp on the dishes is fantastic and sauces are so good. Glad they are open for lunch because it is a staple for us now!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! They have delicious food and great hospitality. My favorite are the crispy potstickers! At night, they play live music! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I haven't even started eating yet, and the customer service alone is worth 5 stars. I've been assisted by 3 people already. Ridiculously friendly staff. Oh and the first part of my lunch is here, soup, and it's really good! Waiting for my Happy Family dish:)"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Signing Panda's on a date night. Great food and great entertainment!"}
{"text":"Good food..   its the best chicken and beef quality that I have seen in any chinese restaurant..    They can work on the taste a little, But over all, Very Good.

Service is also Very good , they try very hard to serve customers well, and very nice staff..  I would For sure go back..   

Keep it up,  don't let the profit dictate your quality..  Great Start.."}
{"text":"GREAT and very tasty Chinese food - we did take out but thought the portions were too stingy for the price."}
{"text":"Would give 6/5 stars if possible.
-Food: 5/5, hard pressed to find better quality and flavor on most if not all of the menu items
-Price: 5/5, some places you get what you pay for, which is great, but here you get even more than that
-Atmosphere: 4/5, the restaurant itself is in a bit rough part of Chandler, but don't let that stop you as the inside in very cozy and comfortable mixing the feel of a small Chinese restaurant and old school singing cafe/bar
-Service: 5/5, As you may see from many other reviews, the owner, Sherry, herself is often seen making sure everyone is enjoying their meal. You know the service is good when customers naturally know the owner's name.
-Entertainment: +1 Bonus Star, Free shows most nights, entertaining tribute singers and pianist. Makes for a great, but still casual, experience. Sherry herself is a phenomenal singer in both English and Chinese dialects.

Now that the headline summary is out of the way, why should you care about my ratings? I have been to Singing Pandas more than 5 times. I have ordered the Orange Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, and my favorite, the Sesame Chicken. I have also tried, by proxy, the Pepper Steak, Black Pepper Chicken, Sizzling Rice Soup, and Mongolian Beef. Of the appetizers I have had the Pot Stickers (pan fried and crispy fried, both great), Egg Rolls, Calamari and Chili Peppers, and Crab Angels. I am also a huge fan of hot jasmine tea, Singing Pandas provides an individual, cup sized pot of hot tea and a single serve tea bag. Small? Sure, but just ask for more hot water and can easily get 3 smooth, calm, and cleansing cups of hot jasmine tea from the provided tea bag.

As for the entertainment I have seen the pianist and the Legends Tribute shows. During the Legends Tribute show Sherry stepped up to the stage in a beautiful blue Chinese styled dress and sang 3 songs, 2 in I believe Cantonese and 1 in English.

In closing, Singing Pandas is a rarity of quality. Not the fancy, likely unnecessarily expensive type of quality, but the well built and refreshing type of quality that everyone could use a bit more of in their life."}
{"text":"First time at this lovely Asian restaurant and had a terrific time with my family! Great food, service and fun entertainment:) The owner is very welcoming and attentive to the patrons. Made us feel very comfortable, as if we were in her home.  Good cocktail and beer selections and traditional American Chinese cuisine.  We had crispy potstickers, chicken egg rolls, beef chow fun, Kung pao chicken, Mongolian beef, mu shu pork, beef with peppers and orange chicken. All very delicious! Make reservations as they get booked up quickly. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Was there this week and going back tonight.  Its casual, its quaint, the waitresses are friendly/helpful, food very good and \"distinctively flavored\" and prices are perfect! True the front entry service is not traditional however just walk to the service counter and ask to be seated and they will take care of you. Service was fast, food very hot, very good tasting and a very nice restaurant experience for me and my family.  Now is it 5 Star dinining? No, If I want that I will travel north or hit a branded hotel with white linens and tuxedos. Its local, its good, its famliy friendly and affordable for multiple visits or large groups. I recommend it for a night out, family dinner, lunch or just get take out and get the whilte linen service in your own home :)"}
{"text":"Been here twice & both times were outrageously fun. Great food, value & entertainment...what more can you ask for? Sherry & Mike are Rock Stars!"}
{"text":"We went to Singing Panda on a whim and came out feeling like members of the family. The very best Chinese food we have ever had in Arizona plus top notch entertainment. We have gone 6 times in the last 7 weeks and each time we brought friends who said they could not wait to visit again. Mike puts on a great show and Sherry will melt your hearts whether she is cooking, serving or singing with her amazing voice. I know I am taking a risk on posting this as we may have trouble getting in ourselves. Truly an Oasis in the desert!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up some fried rice to go. While I was waiting I peeked in the main dining room and saw that they were doing live music. To my utter amazement someone was dressed like Elvis singing \"Are you lonesome tonight\". I can't make this stuff up. I actually felt like I was transported back in time to a bar in Vegas off the main strip. Well I got my fried rice and left. Here's the thing. The bill for the fried rice was $12.90 with tax. I thought wow, this is pretty damn expensive for fried rice from a Chinese joint in The east valley but you never know so I proceeded to eat the fried rice and it was just OK. Not great - just mediocre. In fact it was pretty much on par with half a dozen other chinese restaurants that I had gotten Togo food at over the last few months. I am sure they have to pay for the live music so they build that into the prices and I guess I could live with that if I was dining there but I was picking up food to go so my advice to them is that you have an in house dining menu with one set of prices and a Togo menu with another price point because I will never go back there and pick up mediocre fried rice for $13 especially when I can get the same quality fried rice from a dozen other places for $5 less."}
{"text":"Singing Pandas is delicious! The best combination fried rice we've had in a while. We also tried the crab angels, chicken egg rolls and Cantonese Noodles. Ordered take out, they were quick and the food was ready when we arrived. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is our 3rd time to this amazing family owned and operated restaurant. Thank you Sherry (owner) for always making us feel so welcomed and part of your family. We absolutely love the food, service and awesome entertainment!!! Best restaurant in the East Valley."}
{"text":"We were there on a Saturday night, friendly service and yummy food! Love the orange chicken, just the way I like it, the breading is thin and crispy, and the meat inside is just right! The best I had so far!  Pepper Steak was also very flavorful. High quality meat, reasonable prices.  Can't wait to go back for more! 

ORANGE CHICKEN, I'll see you soon!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Singing Pandas, it's my favorite restaurant, period! The food is always fresh, hot, and delicious, and staff are so kind and polite. We originally came in on a whim, and it's now a staple in the household. The Hong Kong wonton soup is especially great for when you're a little under the weather. Love, love this place!"}
{"text":"For my money it's the tastiest Chinese I have been able to find in Chandler, and I'm a bit of a Chinese food snob originally hailing from the East Coast. The owner is awesome and the service is phenomenal. They always do a special order for my extremely picky toddler of a plate of boiled chicken and won ton soup broth, which I am very appreciative of. Definitely go if you haven't been there already."}
{"text":"Great service, clean, and attractive decor. Food was great, prepared well. Had the Szechuan beef, special plate, not shown on menu. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"We love the food and service here! Love the yellow curry and orange chicken. Everything is on point!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've ever had! Chicken and green beans is the best...but really everything I've had has been great! Everyone is so nice and I love the entertainment they have!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food. Cordial servers. 
The live music on the weekends is great. 
Overall made our mothers day celebration memorable."}
{"text":"I was extremely hesitant about trying a new Chinese food place. I went in super scared but ordered the Orange chicken lunch special. The owner talked to me and basically calmed my nerves. I got my order and OMG it was phenomenal! I have never tasted orange chicken that amazing in my life and we have take out all the time. The rice was amazing. The only thing that wasnt too great was the spring roll, but thats just a personal preference. Highly recommended. Told my coworker about it and she went and loved it to. Definitely will be in to try more things in the very near future!"}
{"text":"A jewel in Chandler! Love their Egg Rolls. Food is wonderful. Employees are great and all are American Asians. Owner Sheri is special."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with family. Upon entering, we were surprised by nice decor. It seemed out of place from the neighborhood and outside architecture. Upon seeing the menu, we knew this place was not authentic Chinese. And we were right when the food came - too healthy (white meat for chicken satay, for example). So set your expectation appropriately before you come here. Food was okay. Service was nothing special. I think the biggest attraction was live performance, which we didn't get to see, since it started at 6pm."}
{"text":"Great service, great prices, great atmosphere, but above all the BEST Chinese food I have had in years. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great time!  Let me start by saying we came in on a weekday and found out they had a piano player for the evening which proceeded to play many tunes from the 40's through the 70's. I understand there is an Elvis impersonator that comes in too. Our family ranged in ages from 8 through 70 and all enjoyed the show.  Between the cheesy atmosphere, food, and great company, we had many laughs and a wonderful time. 

The food was hot and served quickly. It is typical Chinese food and the portions are fairly large. The beverage service (refills) was a little slow, but there were many large groups. I honestly did not mind the few extra minutes of wait time as the piano man kept things light and fun. 

If you want some entertainment, decent food, and a place to hang out with the family for some fun, then this is the place."}
{"text":"Where should I start? The food? The service? The show!?! This place is awesome!!! The food was fabulous! Everything cooked to order and so fresh! This is the Chinese food I grew up with...the Egg Fu Yung was delicious! The customer service was outstanding...the moment you sit down till the check comes...\"are you ok? Do you need anything?\" I loved it! And finally the show...this guy can sing anything and his impersonations...you gotta see for yourself! Just do it!"}
{"text":"Family and I had an urge for Chinese food close by, and Yelp pointed us here. The place is immaculate and the staff was extremely friendly. The food is top notch and fresh. We are so glad to have a great restaurant like the Singing Pandas in the neighborhood. Now, we need to check out the live entertainment from 6-8. Do yourself a favor and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful service. There is an entertainer most nights.  Tonight they had a piano player.  The owner came up to the stage and sang a couple of songs. It was a fun atmosphere even for a Thursday night. The food was very delicious and did not feel heavy.  Looking forward to going back very soon."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the entertainment at the restaurant. The show was almost two hours, and there's no extra charge. I ordered the Singapore Noodles, which I've had many times before at other restaurants. I thought this dish was rather dry, and not as flavorful as in other places. It could have done with more curry and spice. That said, everyone else in my group loved their food, so I think I just ordered the wrong thing! Going back next week and will try something else."}
{"text":"I'm so damn full!  Standing in my kitchen eating the left overs from dinner. Every bite I tell myself \"You're full, you don't need any more of this.\"  But, I can't stop. 

We went to dinner, for the first time, tonight at Singing Pandas and left very happy. Everyone is a snob when it comes to ethnic food. They think the (fill in ethnicity here) food was so much better where they grew up. Well, I lived my first 25 years in San Jose, CA and since I moved to Phoenix I have not found what I felt was good, let alone great, Chinese food. Until tonight. Anyone from San Jose that ever went to The Good Luck restaurant on Cottle Rd. will love this place. 

The owner made a point to stop by every table and check in. She is very sweet and you can feel that she has her full heart invested in her restaurant. The service was professional, expedient, and personable. Food came out of the kitchen quickly, even at 7:00 on a Saturday night. 
And live entertainment to boot. Who could ask for more???"}
{"text":"Haven't had a chance to write a review but it was last month and we didn't feel Like cooking so we decided to try singing pandas. We love Chinese food but it's so hard to find a good clean place with great traditional food. Just so tired of pei Wei and pf changs to salty. We ordered take out and brought the food home and everyone loved it! The manager was very friendly on the phone and helpful describing the items on the menu. 
The King pao chicken is delicious, the curry chicken is amazing. The hot and sour soup is delicious she even told me it had pork in it when I ordered and she said she could do it without pork. 
I love the calamari and chiles just wish it had slices of hot peppers. I highly recommend singing pandas, didn't get a chance to dine in yet the restaurant itself is clean and nice inside."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service excellent. They were able to accommodate my gluten free vegan options easily. The entertainment was a bonus to the delicious food. My sister was visiting from Hawaii and felt the food was delicious as well   This was the most fun eating experience I've had since I went on a cruise. The Singapore noodles and eggplant with tofu were gustatory delights. I have a very difficult time finding Chinese restaurants that offer so many gluten free options. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great food.  Great experience.  I had the General Tso chicken.  Excellent is every respect.  The show is well done and the service impeccable.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Chinese food and Elvis impersonator, what more do you want for dinner on a Saturday night?  It can be cold and loud in the bar area but that's where all the action is.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"FIXED POOR RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT!!! January 8, 2016. Yeah they are 3 weeks old...sure they might get better. 

Welcome to the popularity of Ocotillo Friends.  They can make and break your business in a heartbeat.  

So we tried this place again and it is getting much better. We asked for changes below and the team at singing panda made some changes for the better. 

Great Chinese!  Oh and check out the singing Elvis!!!! He is just awesome! 

1) Fix your restaurant layout formal hostess stand separate from to go orders
2) Add more tables. You clearly don't have enough. 
3) Hire a professional kitchen manager. 
    A) Someone should be dedicated to drinks and refills. Hire a buser for that and clearing tables. 
    B) Someone should be dedicated to getting out appetizers. If people have something to munch on the rest is less painful. 
    C) Prepare food in advance. 
   D) Ventilate the restaurant...lung cancer is not worth it!

Ocotillo Friends...try this place again!"}
{"text":"Me and my two girlfriends had a wonderful lunch today. After we went to a movie , one of my friends came down with food poisoning during a movie. This happened about 1:30 to 2 hr after eating. She had soup, and orange chicken. I would like to hear from you as what happened?"}
{"text":"Top notch customer service. Killer food. Spectacular entertainment. Green curry chicken and Mongolian Beef was outstanding. Yan, Sherry and Mike showed us why we love life. Had so much fun and loved everything we  ordered."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I have ever hand. Had the sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, crab angels, lo mein chicken and mongolian beef. Everything was fresh, tender and hot. Entertainment was wonderful. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food we've had since moving here 5 years ago.  Very tasty, very light (not too saucy) and very reasonable for the high quality of food and service.  Sherry was very helpful with information on dishes and we definitely will make Singing Pandas our \"go-to\" place for Chinese food.  The restaurant has a nice, clean, upscale feel to it...so don't be concerned that it's surrounded by auto repair shops and other industrial businesses just west of McQueen Road on Chandler Blvd.  Give Singing Pandas a try, you'll be glad you did!

We tried and loved the General Tso chicken, moo shu pork and shrimp egg foo yung...all of which we would highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Mongolian beef is super delicious! The vegetable lo mein is a huge portion and it's so good. The spring rolls taste so fresh. The staff is very friendly and welcoming! This is my favorite place to eat in Chandler."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! My husband and I came here for dinner and a few weeks later we ended up back with a big group of people. There was about 10 of us and everyone loved their food and the entertainment. Service is great! Such  a hidden gem in Chandler!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed and very satisfied with this restaurant. We were created and seated immediately. The food I ordered was hot and delicious. I definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"We went to Singing Pandas based on the Yelp reviews alone, and it did not disappoint.  The entertainment area was full, so we sat in the dining area.  We were still able to listen to the music (which wasn't bad!) and have a conversation.  The restaurant itself was very clean and well-kept.  The service was absolutely fantastic, and the food was delicious.  I recommend the Orange Chicken and Mongolian Beef.  The portions are very generous, and she gave me extra rice to take home with my leftovers.  Highly recommend for a fun, casual dinner.  Also great for kids...my 10-year old daughter loved it."}
{"text":"The food here was good but not very notable.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.  The entertainment was fun but too loud if you're in the main room.  Sometimes the audience would sing along - which was great fun.  The sound system however was not always up to the task of reaching the high notes and would screech.  I think they would benefit from having a sound engineer.  The owners/entertainers are clearly enjoying themselves which makes the whole experience more endearing.  We enjoyed ourselves but there is room for improvement."}
{"text":"Loved this Place!   Had read the reviews, but just tried it for the first time. The service was excellent, very attentive.  We tried a variety of menu items:  Crab Angels, Chicken Egg Rolls, Orange Chicken and the Cantonese Pan Fried Noodles.   All the food was very good.
We were also there on a Thursday, Piano Night !  Entertainment was fun and the crowd seemed to really enjoy it.  The crowd was mixed; families, couples  - younger and older !
We'll be Back !"}
{"text":"This place is a real hidden gem! We've driven by it a million times, not realizing and decided to try it out on my husband's birthday. The service was friendly and prompt and it's nice to be in a locally owned place with delicious, homemade food and unique entertainment.

Our family ordered crab puffs, fried tofu, seafood soup, hot and sour soup, some curry noodles, orange chicken, a shrimp walnut dish and egg foo yung with chicken. We had both white and fried rice. Everything was very tasty and my husband says it's the best crab puffs and orange chicken he's had...certainly the most fresh!

We expected higher prices because of the entertainment, but you won't pay more here than any other restaurant! Do bring a little cash to tip the entertainment. I rarely carry cash, but happened to have some and was glad...it's nice to tip and the guy on our night took requests. It was a lot of fun.

The entertainment is kitchy, but really fun and makes the experience complete. We all agreed immediately we'd be returning. We went on a Wednesday but were advised, like many reviews here, that on the weekends it gets busy so to make reservations and we certainly will."}
{"text":"Stopped in at lunch time on a Saturday.   The food was delicious. Szechuan beef was delicious and so was the Happy family plate.  We will be visiting here again."}
{"text":"Been looking for back home Chinese and everyone said go here.  OMG NO and this Elvis singer is a joke, every one laughs, they think it is entertaining but it is a joke, hell no!!!"}
{"text":"I chose the kung pao chicken. The dish was spicy and flavorful. Unfortunately, I came on a Sunday night and there was no live entertainment. The restaurant was pretty quiet, but the waitress was very talkative. 

I also had the beef chow fun. The meat was not as chewy as other restaurants, so I thought that was good. I felt that the food was pretty typical of what one might find at a fast food Chinese restaurant.

The service was friendly and overall it was tasty American style Chinese food.  Definitely higher quality meat cuts than your typical Chinese restaurant.  We will try to come back on an entertainment day."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love pandas? I mean...really. They're adorable- which is actually the reason why this place caught my eye. Well that and the reviews. My hubby and I went for lunch to try it out. The service was pleasant and very friendly. They were attentive with the drinks but we must have had 3 different waitresses approach and ask how we were...it got a little awkward. 
The food was okay. I was a little bummed out that the food didn't match the service or the atmosphere. We got Singapore Rice Noodles and Mongolian Beef. The noodles were sooo salty. I had to dilute them with plain white rice to cut the salt. Mongolian Beef was okay but not thin enough and just lacked authentic flavor. It was such a shame. I really wanted to love this place. I don't know if we will return since the prices were also higher than other Chinese places we've tried in town."}
{"text":"My family often gets take out from here as they are sensitive to gluten allergies (and the food is great). I recently met some friends at the restaurant to dine in and we had a great time.  The service was stellar (very attentive while not making us feel rushed at all) and we had entertainment to boot on a Wednesday evening! Great food, great service, great time overall.  I want to go back with my son on a night when the Elvis impersonator is there.  Too much fun!"}
{"text":"Singing pandas Asian restaurant and bar is my go to place for delicious Asian food and entertainment! My family and I love coming here the folks that run the place are super friendly! Sunday's is the time I like coming here enjoy the top notch service by Vini one of the many folks that make sure that everything is all good!"}
{"text":"Awesome little restaurant!  I go here for lunch all the time, and it's not super busy.  They have extremely fast service.  I used to go here for the Kung Pao Chicken, which is very good.  Then I tried the Mongolian Beef!  Best Mongolian Beef ever!  They slice it nice and thick and only use the best kind of beef.  It's not filet Mignon, but it's gotta be pretty close to that cut.  The sauce is also to die for.  Excellent, excellent dish.  

I felt kinda sorry for them because of their location, and wanted to support them, so I took my family to dinner there one night, and couldn't get in because the crowd was out the freaking door!   I guess the word is out on this hidden gem.  I'll have to be satisfied with my lunch visits."}
{"text":"Just left after a very nice dinner. Food was very good have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant since moving here from California.  All the chicken dishes had a generous amount of food and all the vegetables were fresh.  Everything was well seasoned and hot.  Wait staff was attentive and courteous. Only suggestion I would make is the potstickers need to be crispier.  I will be back again, didn't really want to give this review as it.may get too busy or crowded.  Hey but they deserve it!"}
{"text":"I recently heard of Singing Pandas through word of mouth. My cousin was raving to my mom about how good the food was, so I went there tonight along with my parents and my grandma.

I was not expecting actual singing, lol, but everybody enjoyed the entertainment.  It's a fairly small restaurant which, along with the intimate lighting, gave it a cozy feel.  Overall, a nice-looking place.  But the strong whiff of deliciousness coming from the kitchen is what reeled me in.  Also, the servers are very courteous and attentive, not a single staff member was without a smile.

We had quite a variety on the table.  I ordered the green curry chicken with steamed rice.  My dad ordered moo goo gai pan (which isn't on the menu, but the chef was able to prepare it).  My mom ordered chicken egg foo young and mu shu pork to share, and my grandma had orange chicken with the sauce on the side to keep it crispy.

We sampled each other's dishes, which were all tasty.  When I got to my green curry I was floored.  The flavor  of the coconut milk-based sauce was smooth, herbaceous and mildly spicy.  Bathing in the sauce was tender chicken, crisp bamboo shoots, just-cooked green beans, green bell peppers, eggplant and a touch of Thai basil.  Spooned on top of fragrant jasmine rice, the dish was an instant favorite at the table.  I even tried it on the fried rice - so good.

The servers ensured that our food arrived promptly to the table, hot and fresh.  They were on top of it all night.  Even the owner, Sherry, visited our table to see if we were enjoying our meal before and after ascending to the stage for a performance.

Although it was a busy Saturday night, the great food and excellent service made my family and I feel like we had the restaurant all to ourselves.  I can't wait to come back and try more of Singing Pandas' dishes.  I've got my eye on the pan-fried noodles next!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, very attentive staff. The food is delicious with big portion sizes and is well worth its cost! I love the spicy calamari and the vegetables compliment it very well. The chicken egg flower soup was perfect and the orange chicken and Mongolian chicken was very tender. The Kung Pao chicken was super tasty but very spicy because we asked for maximum spice so I'd suggest go with the spice that it comes with. Other than that, the experience we've had here is pleasurable."}
{"text":"I remember the first time I ate here. It was a Thursday & there were 12 of us. Everyone ordered different dishes & some shared. The food literally melted in my mouth. It was so tasty and delicious. The two ladies serving us were very attentive. We never had to signal for them ever & they always had beautiful smiles. What a pleasant experience & the one man show played many favorites to the 70's & 80's songs. Several of us got up to dance, it was an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to in Arizona. The meat is so tender and you can tell it is high quality. I can't wait to try other dishes. I had the Mongolian beef and my girlfriend had the orange chicken. Both were amazing, cooked to perfection, and full of flavor. The staff are friendly and helpful, and care about customer service! I was very impressed.

I even had a beer and a cocktail. The drink prices are the lowest I've seen outside of happy hour pricing at other places. The on site bar really makes it nice. Plus, they have live entertainment at night which is a bonus. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to try a new place. I will be a returning customer for sure!"}
{"text":"Great meal, great entertainment!"}
{"text":"We've been to Singing Pandas twice now and it was great both times. Very attentive service and super fresh food. I love the pot stickers, and everything we've ordered - pot stickers, different curries, chicken and vegetable stir fry - has all been delicious. The entertainment has been exactly the same when we've gone, but was still entertaining and fun."}
{"text":"Food - excellent. Wait staff - friendly and attentive. Entertainment - exceptional and engaging. Who could ask for more? What a great place. We loved it and will be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to see what all the hoopla was about at Singing Pandas.  The place is newish -looking with nice booths and tables.  Looks really clean too.  

We had two lunch specials, Shrimp with lobster sauce and Orange chicken.  We asked that the orange chicken not have breading on it.  Each special came with chicken egg drop soup which was delicate and flavorful, a vegetarian egg roll and plain fried rice (no meat).  The shrimp with lobster sauce was made with black bean sauce, fresh medium size shrimp and onions and peppers. Unfortunately it was so salty that it is now 9PM and I am still drinking water.  The chef has to lay off the salt since black bean sauce is a naturally salty product.  

The orange chicken was indeed made without the breading as requested, but the sauce had a \"ketchup-y\" flavor to it and was not enjoyed.  The fried rice was freshly made but not very flavorful while the vegetable roll had lots of veggies and a nice ginger flavor.  

The prices are very fair and the staff was really attentive, friendly and polite which is one of the reasons  they will do very well."}
{"text":"First time being here and it's fantastic! Don't let the exterior deter you from coming in. The place inside is super clean and modern. The food was excellent! Definitely would come back here again."}
{"text":"My son asks to go here repeatedly! The food is fantastic and the entertainment is an unexpected surprise. It has become a go to spot for out of town guests."}
{"text":"Food was just okay, but of course because I am Asian and I know what Great Asian food tastes like. I had it better somewhere else. The food was not freshly cooked. They seemed to be microwaved and brought out to the table. Chicken and beef were sliced too thick. Music is extremely LOUD. My friends and I had to scream over one another, instead of having a normal conversation. If you would like to try this place out, be sure to grab a table in a separate dining room next door unless you want to be entertained by the loud music and singing of the pandas."}
{"text":"I will never go to another Chinese place EVER! This place blew me away. I never order orange chicken for the simple fact it's always greasy or the breaking is mushy. But my daughter does. I tasted hers and couldn't stop tasting it. It was fresh and fantastic. I had the yellow curry and it was delicious. It earned it was hot but mine was nice. Still good flavoring. Will be taking everyone here. Only suggestion is that I just can't find one place that serves those little won ton chips at the beginning. I guess I have to make my own! The atmosphere is great. Have not checked out the entertainment yet. Looks like fun. Great place for the east valley!"}
{"text":"This is an assume place to eat Asian food portions are large, staff very friendly and great singing, pricing is fair.
I would recommend this place it's great entertainment."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great atmosphere, super friendly staff and amazing service. This is one of our family's favorite places. We've gotten takeout a few times, but it's always more fun eating there. My favorite dish is the beef with snow peas (wow)"}
{"text":"Food is great! Prices are great and the Las Vegas like show is super fun! This is such a little gem in Chandler! Order the calamari and I hope you get to experience Neil Diamond's Sweet Caroline song ... we will come again! Great place to celebrate a birthday - they have wine and even beer pitchers  Kid friendly too, Elvis will give your kiddos little pandas!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out based on the Yelp recommendations. This place did not disappoint! The staff was extremely courteous and attentive (most Asian restaurants aren't very customer service centric). 

The restaurant was clean, atmosphere was inviting and the food was delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Trying to find the best fried rice around, this is not the place. The beef n broccoli was pretty good, sweet n sour chicken also good. Fried rice was not worth it, shoulda just accepted the white rice as the side instead of paying for not so good fried rice."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Chinese food so I knew I had to try out Singing Pandas as soon as possible after I saw it come up on Yelp! The front parking lot was only about half full when we went there around 8pm (an hour before they closed) on a Friday but the restaurant was still really busy. We were greeted and taken to a table fairly quickly, and then given a couple of water cups and time to browse the menu.

My boyfriend got the Lucky Buddha beer to drink and the Mongolian Beef to eat, per recommendation of our waitress, and I got my usual pick at Chinese places, Kung Pao Chicken. We upgraded to egg fried rice for $1 extra each. It didn't take too long for the food to come and everything smelled so good! I had only a couple of bites of the Mongolian Beef but it was really tasty. The sauce was definitely the best part of the dish, and the beef was really well cooked. I thought it it tasted good with the onions and scallions. My boyfriend really enjoyed this dish. The Kung Pao chicken was good too with chopped onions, bell peppers, zucchini, and peanuts. It was only a little bit spicy and more so just really flavorful.  Both dishes had just the right amount of sauce to mix with the fried rice! Yum.

Looking around the restaurant, it seemed like there was a variety of dishes ordered. From everything I saw, it looked great and smelled even better! My only recommendation is: skip the fried rice. $1 isn't much but it wasn't worth the cost as it pretty much just tasted like white rice with a splash of soy sauce. Like I previously mentioned, the dishes had enough sauce so getting plain white rice would have been just fine.

The service was spot on throughout the time we were there. Our waitress as well as other waitresses came by to check on us a few times. I'll definitely be back to dine-in or grab a take-out order."}
{"text":"Great food fast service and low prices! Plus large portions! Can't beat this place for Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Great food and entertainment! My husband and I ordered sesame chicken with egg fried rice, both were delicious and we will definitely be ordering it again! Entertainment was nice, live singing was a great bonus!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and incredibly good entertainment.  I would give it five stars if the menu was larger.  However, whatever they serve is fresh and good.  The service is always great."}
{"text":"Went for lunch one day... and it was fine. The problem is that I have a tough time finding really good Chinese Food... and since I'm from San Francisco, I think the problem is that I have my sights set too high. Service was fine... they have a lounge area that we inadvertently sat in with a 2 year old, haha. Just be mindful of that when you go..."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place . Food is great and the entertainment was so much fun . Make sure to make reservation or sit in the opposite dining room area. Music gets loud but lots of fun ."}
{"text":"Really good service and the food was really good. Food was fresh cooked and hot. There was a bit of a long wait for a larger group but the food being good made up for it. Servers were really attentive and speedy too."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try Singing Panda's for a few months and finally got around to it on Saturday! I can't believe it took me so long because I have been truly missing out all along. We did order take-out and the ordering process was very simple, pickup in 30 minutes on a Saturday Night. The food was absolutely awesome! Another reviewer mentioned that it reminded her of Chinese Food back east and I couldn't agree more. We ordered the Yellow Curry Chicken (5 stars), Kung Pao (5 stars), Singapore Rice Noodles (Amazing!) and the Wonton Soup (Awesome). 

They do have live entertainment 6 days a week that starts at 6:00pm. One day I will eat in so I can enjoy the live show. 

You have to give it a try! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome environment, excellent service from very nice people, great show, and really good food at a great price. This place is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, and the entertainment is one of a kind. The elvis impersonation is as good as it gets. Looking for a fun night out give this place try show up early to get a good seat!!"}
{"text":"Three of us went for dinner on Saturday night.  I had heard from friends that the food was really good and I am so glad we finally went for dinner. The food was awesome and so tasty.  Great service also; our drinks were never empty.  3 of us ate for $50 including an appetizer. Return factor is 100%"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service! Me and my boyfriend love to come here. Portions are so big we share one entree!"}
{"text":"Such good Chinese food! I tried the egg rolls, orange chicken and general Tso's chicken and it was all delicious. Generous portions and they even gave me some rice to take to go with my left overs. Everyone was friendly and they even had live entertainment on a Tuesday night! It was a great environment I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Singing Panda is unlike any other asian restaurant. It is by far the best place I've been too. They have really affordable food that has the highest quality. The thing that really sets this place apart from others is the embrace of live entertainment. The owner is probably one of the most amazing people alive. She really owns up to her demand for high quality food as well as the unique environment she provides. All of the employees are amazing as well, they encourage friendship and hospitality unlike any other. They have a strong sense of happiness that is easily spread to others. I believe this comes from their strong bond to each other and their pride in serving others.
5 stars and 5 diamonds for them."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever!! Customer service is extremely wonderful. The owner also helps out and is so very friendly. She also has a great singing voice. This place makes you feel like home. I spent my birthday here and it was so much fun."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint!!! Very good food and great customer service. Thank you Singing Pandas we will be back!! Must try."}
{"text":"Very good food,  large portions  citrus chicken Delicious..  Entertainment was very good as well. Where can you get entertainment and eat too?  We just go there  for a beer and entertainment sometimes. Beer cheap (draft) good deal."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! All the ingredients are very fresh and high quality and it's a great value for the price paid. The orange chicken is addicting and the beef is so tender and juicy. Why go somewhere else and pay the same price for inferior food?"}
{"text":"We had a great time celebrating my fiancée birthday. The entertainment was amazing and the owner wow she has voice! Food and service was great as well especially with a party of eight. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Chinese cuisine and this place is now one of my favorites. It's clean, staff is very friendly and helpful, service is fast and food is absolutely delish. For those who likes quiet places to eat, maybe it's not a good option, because they have music shows almost all the time. Well, what do you expect at the restaurant called Singing Pandas?! =)"}
{"text":"We went here during the afternoon and it was a little bit slow so it provided us with a greatly attentive waitstaff who answered all of our questions, and they even told us about the nightly entertainment they have between 6 and 8 pm. 

They have a variety of flavored iced teas offered, and I had the watermelon.  It was delicious.  My girlfriend had the passion fruit flavor and she wanted to make her own at home afterward because it was that good.

We ordered the General Tso's Chicken (spicier) and Mongolian Beef.  We were told the beef used was angus and would be tender, that wasn't a lie!  The beef was tender and melted in my mouth.  The onions were cooked perfectly and still had some crunch to them.

The chicken was excellent but could have been spicier, I'll make sure to ask for that next time.  

I look forward to my next visit where I want to try to the sizzling rice soup and chicken curry."}
{"text":"Great food, prices, and service! We got 3 items and we all loved them. Came with soup and a spring roll and they were super reasonable. Recommend general tso. Beautiful atmosphere that looks recently remodeled. We will definitely be coming back for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Came for a lunch special.. general tso chicken.
But.. NO egg drop soup! Only Hot & Sour.  My only other choice is salad. But.. the salad isn't really salad. It is just a plate of shredded cabbage ... We could call it cole slaw  I guess.  I wanted to get a chicken egg roll instead of the spring that comes with the lunch. Nope. I have to order an appetizer (2 in an order).  Sigh..."}
{"text":"So! Much! FUN!! We rolled into town for the Pot of Gold music festival and, looking for something we don't have at home, landed at Singing Pandas. We called ahead and got ourselves a table for dinner in the \"Music Room\" and proceeded to have the best time, dining on some of the best Chinese I've had in a while and listening to the fantastic Mr. Villa sing American classics. We sang along while we got our drinks and placed our family-style order. Everything was absolutely delicious, including the yellow curry, which instantly took me right back to my travels through Asia. Seriously, the curry is ALMOST worth driving back from Santa Barbara, CA for, it's that good. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Nomnomnom!! 

Should we ever be headed back to Chandler, Singing Pandas will be at the top of our list!"}
{"text":"We have now taken all of our family from out of town here. My 6 year old twins just adore the show. They beg to come here every weekend.  The food is fresh and incredible. Usually Chinese makes me feel tired and ill after eating  but not Singing Pandas!  My family from LA loved this place and the food, considering they have fantastic food at their finger tips anytime, they were amazed with how good everything was.  The owner is awesome and my kids love her. She lets them come up on the stage and dance with her.  We wish they delivered and would pay any delivery fee!  
Things we love:
Orange chicken 
Black peppercorn chicken
Fried potstickers 
Kung pao 
All cocktails are yummy too"}
{"text":"Checked this place out because I read good reviews. I liked the service and live music. The food was okay. I ordered shrimp egg foo young it was way to salty. They drowned it with a brown gravy. Wish I would've known I would not have got that gravy poured on it. My daughter ordered the orange chicken which she liked. I may give them another try. Oh also I ordered a hot tea the water came out warm & not hot. The guy singing on their stage was really nice, and had a good singing voice."}
{"text":"Service was terrific. We had leftovers for lunch and we're going to go shopping. Sherry offered to refrigerate our leftovers and we could pick them up on our way home. Wow. Don't see service like that often and the food was delicious. Try the sesame chicken"}
{"text":"Tried this place after reading the reviews and recommendations from family. The restaurant was clean and we were seated right away. The waitress very quick, remembered everything and never let our drinks go empty. The portions were large and was delicious. I will totally go back and use this for take out."}
{"text":"So happy we decided to try this restaurant out! Service was great, food was tasty and the show was wonderful!! We will definitely be returning in the near future. :)"}
{"text":"What a fun find. We arrived on a Tuesday night to find this place packed! This place has a fun vibe and apparently a very big fan base, as I was told its reservations only on Friday and Saturday nights.  This evening we were being entertained by Elvis and then Sherry, who is a great singer and the owner of the restaurant. She is a sweetheart and genuinely enjoys meeting her customers.  The food is good too, the crab angels are the lightest I have ever had. The wonton soup is more than just wonton in broth, it has chicken and shrimp and veggies that were fresh. The sesame chicken was a plate of deep-fried chicken pieces in a sweet sauce.  My mom had the Egg Fu young and it was a huge portion and very tasty. They have a great cocktail, beer, and wine list and I think this would be a great place for a group to share apps and drinks and enjoy the show."}
{"text":"What a transformation from the yellow brick shack! First visit to Pandas and satisfied but don't go there to visit. VERY LOUD in room with entertainment and pretty crowded. Food good, service excellent, entertainment included makes it a plus. Will try again when not so packed as it was this Sat. Nite for early show. Owner talks to you and seems sincere."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is awesome. Singing Panda has the best service of any Asian restaurant I have ever been to. They had a line out the door but they still made time to make you feel like a valued customer. Menu is somewhat limited but everything we ordered was perfect. Quality in the ingredients is obvious. I am definitely going back"}
{"text":"Ate here for my first time on a Wednesday evening. Started out with some chicken egg rolls which were basically tasteless. I ordered beef chow fun with fried rice ($1.50 extra) and my significant other had pork with snow peas that came with white rice. The fried rice was below average and definitely not worth the upcharge. The chow fun was OK. It had a different spice in it (lemon grass?) which I felt was weird. The 2nd dish was very good. The prices were higher than usual probably due to the entertainment provided. There is better Chinese in the East Valley. I will not return"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  We sat in the bar/stage section of the restaurant and enjoyed the live entertainment-especially the Elvis impersonations. It really created such a fun and upbeat vibe.  Ordered the crab angels, potstickers, General Tso's chicken & green curry chicken -the food tasted great and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The drinks were reasonably priced and the service from all staff members was amazing.  Will definitely be revisiting again."}
{"text":"We had dinner for 4  at Singing Pandas and it was amazing! We can't wait to go back, the food, cocktails and service are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I love the live music, the performers are interesting characters. I think the customer service overshadows the food, but they do provide great customer service. My family had no complaints about the food, it just didn't really stand out. I would say give it a try!"}
{"text":"We just discovered Singing Pandas last week, and had to come back again this week! I'm surprised we hadn't heard of this place sooner. The food is fantastic, and the entertainment is a lot of fun. Our 8 year old daughter loves going to sing along, dance, and the singers are really engaging with her. The owner takes a lot of pride in cooking healthy food with the best ingredients, and it shows. Overall awesome restaurant, and a unique experience!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. It doesn't look like much from the outside but it's beautiful and clean on the inside. Staff is very friendly. Food comes out fast and fresh. The go to place for Chinese food in Chandler."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!! Great food, amazing staff, AND well priced! Came in time to catch live music over dinner. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"DE-LICIOUS!!! By far the BEST Chinese food in AZ! Remember that it gets packed in here...cuz the food is bomb! Make sure you try the pan fried noodles and sesame chicken...mmm mmm mmmmm!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and entertainment. We went with a group and we all enjoyed our food. Additionally, the service was very attentive and prices reasonable. We saw the Legends show and got to hear the owner sing which was a special treat."}
{"text":"I've  been taking friends & family to this amazing restaurant since they began the food/entertainment concept a couple of years ago.  I can't say enough about the experience for everyone I've brought to Panda.  The food is excellent, obviously mad e with quality ingredients---served piping hot by fast and efficient servers.  
The entertainment is wonderful--Mike and Sherry are very talented---be sure to ask Sherry to sing \"I will always love you.\"  When she hits those high notes it's a very beautiful sound.  
Don't miss this experience yourself,  but also don't forget to take your out-of-town friends for this fun evening expertly put together by this talented and hard working couple. 
 Wish I could post 7 stars."}
{"text":"Great service and a good selection of lunch specials.  It was a first visit based on Yelper's reviews and I will go back again soon."}
{"text":"First experience. Lettuce wraps.. Very good. Sesame chicken 5 stars. Service 5 stars. Live music.. what an experience. Loved it."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my Orange Chicken dish. Here's a tip: you can order any of the fried chicken dishes to be sautéed instead for a healthier version. Fun entertainment and friendly, efficient service. I can see why business is booming at the Singing Pandas."}
{"text":"I absolutely love, love, love this place. I've tried different things on there menu and there food has not disappointed. The owner is such a sweetheart and such an amazing singer. My favorite Chinese restaurant EVER!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Asian restaurant!  I have only been for lunch but I hear the dinner entertainment is fun.  We've tried the lunch special several times as well as soup (wonton and sweet and sour), I also like the Lettuce wraps.  Very attentive service."}
{"text":"It's become a local favorite with high quality food, never had a bad dish yet and the lunch specials are a great deal."}
{"text":"Gosh so afraid to share this gem.  Where do i begin?  Joe was our server, great advice for food.  Do Not miss out on the calamari n chilis appetizers!  Seriously who would have thought to experience something so wonderful.  I would pass on the egg rolls kind mushy.  We went for dinner and caught the show!  Completely blown away.  Thought i was in vegas.  Make a reservation and go for the most fun night out ever!  Our food was great, orange chicken and a green chicken curry./. We will go again every. Chance we can.  The entertainment changes, but the owner is grace in action.  My breath was taken away.  Thank you for the most beautiful evening.  Can't wait to bring friends and family!! 20 stars****"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! I have ordered take out from here several times now and I have never been disappointed. Above average Chinese food, great prices, and great service."}
{"text":"If I hadn't been there myself, I wouldn't believe how amazing this place is - it's definitely a hidden gem!  The food is excellent and plentiful, and if you happen to go on a Friday or Saturday night you also get to see a fantastic dinner show.  This place is a must visit!"}
{"text":"My family and I are picky when it comes to Asian food, seeing as there aren't many places that seem to take the time to prepare fresh.... however, this is hands down THE BEST FOOD you'll ever eat! Placed a 'to go' order and the staff was super friendly both on the phone and in person! I'd recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Ordered 4 different entrees, they were all great, best Chinese food I've had in the 2 years I've been in AZ. They also have live entertainment in the eveming, which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Came from out of town and took my 90-year-old mom here as she's heard good things about it. We had such a good time.
We split the beef chow fun and the sizzling rice soup and both were prepared perfectly with ample portions and fair price. Delicious. 
Next, the entertainment. On Friday, there was a gentleman who did Sinatra, Elvis, etc and was a lot of fun. Then the owner Sherri came on and did a few old standards along with some Chinese songs. She was also quite good. 
For those who don't want music while eating, there's plenty of seating for that too. 
Talked to Sherri and she has a great energy and heart where I really hope she succeeds and I'm sure she will. Staff is attentive and friendly. I'll be coming back. You gotta give it a try."}
{"text":"We went for a late Friday dinner and loved the food! We had the crab angels which were crispy by not greasy, and shared huge bowl of chicken egg drop soup and an entree of kung pao chicken. This was plenty and we still had leftovers. Our server was attentive and the owner Sherry stopped by to chat and check on our service. Our only disappointment was that we had just missed their Legends performer, Elvis, sing. We will be back to hear him on a Tuesday or weekend evening from 6pm-8pm!"}
{"text":"The service here was superb. Servers were always refilling drinks and removing plates. The food was excellent. All of our chicken dishes were excellent. We are looking forward to going back. Next time we will have a reservation and go during show time."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband on a Saturday night for date night. We had the orange chicken it was wonderful!! Skip the fried rice the white was really good! Be sure to make a reservation in the room entertainment! Drinks and food are reasonably priced. We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Entrees Ordered:  Mongolian Beef & Chicken Teriyaki
Total Bill: $24.94

We meant to add photos but the food smelled so yummy that we just dove in head first!

Starving and looking for something we new we stumbled across this very unassuming Chinese restaurant about 30 minutes before their closing.  When we walked in, we were greeted by everyone that passed us.  They were all so sweet.

We ordered to go and were on our way less than 10 minutes later.  Incredible and friendly service!  While waiting we noticed how clean and modern the restaurant was...comparing it to its surroundings, one would NEVER expect this.

Then we got home and dug in.  It was soooooo good!  Fresh and moist...probably some of the best Chinese food we had ever had.  Highly recommend the Mongolian Beef and Chicken Teriyaki.

Can't wait for more!"}
{"text":"Came here based on the favorable ratings so I was disappointed that this place didn't live up to the hype. 

The staff were very friendly and attentive so I can't knock the service. The food on the other hand was bad. I ordered beef and broccoli and the beef had a weird texture and no seasoning at all. I ate all of the broccoli but couldn't take another bite of the beef. One of the staff came by and asked was my meal okay. I was polite but honest and told him I didn't like the beef. He tried to explain that it was some sort of steak, but I really couldn't  hear him due to the singing on stage. 

They charged an extra 1.50 for a side of fried rice which wasn't worth it. The rice seemed stale and lacked flavor. 

I tried some shrimp out of my husband's shrimp egg foo young and that wasn't good either.

We sat in the showroom but left as soon as we gave up on the meals. 

I'm sorry to give such a low rating because the staff was really friendly but the food was terrible. I can't recommend this place and won't return."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Chinese restaurant ever! The food is amazing, I personally recommend the Crab Angels, calamari, and Mongolian beef. The staff is friendly and the owner is wonderful and always has a smile on her face. It has such a unique atmosphere unlike any other restaurant I have ever been to."}
{"text":"There's a woman who only works here on Sunday that gives outstanding service. She informed us about food, made recommendations and was genuinely friendly. 

The quality of the food was very good. The black pepper beef wasn't quite spicy enough for us but she offered us hot oil and hot mustard to bring the spice up to our level. The kung pao chicken was also very good. The zucchini had an odd flavor but I put it into my brown rice with hot mustard and it was delish. 

We look forward to coming back on a Friday night to hear the performer and maybe even catch his Elvis impersonation."}
{"text":"Singing was good. We sat at the bar which is just in front of the kitchen. Food was ok but not hot temp wise and we sent it back to get some warmth which really changed the texture of the food. 
It was troubling that the food was mot hot just a few feet from the kitchen."}
{"text":"This is my second review on this restaurant but almost 2 years later and it was great before and I can't say enough good things about this place. This is a must stop when visiting the area!"}
{"text":"We weren't sure how this experience would end up, but it was really fun! We took our kids and went on a Tuesday for the Legends Tribute show, Mr. Russell is a great singer and entertainer. The food was good but could have been more flavorful, we got two different curry dishes and both were milder than we're used to. Good sized portions, you could definitely share a dinner with someone. Prices were fair. Food came out in a timely manner and the service was great too. We'll be back on other nights to check out the other shows. We all enjoyed this experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food in a relaxing casual environment. Staff is very friendly. 

They really do have some of the best food. Very flavorful and cooked right."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad....but. we have been going to Yao for several years and it's only 2 miles away from Singing Panda. Every time I find a new Chinese place, I am disappointed...in comparison to Yao. Singing Panda was the same feeling. Plus, we spent 30% more money for 30% less food than we get at Yao AND it wasn't nearly as tasty as Yao."}
{"text":"We have tried Chinese food all over Chandler and thought we had found good food; until we came here. We ordered take-out but when I went in to pick it up, I realized we should have eaten there. What a nice place with live music and a stocked bar.
I ordered General Tso's chicken and my husband got the Happy Family and both were outstanding. Light breading on the spicy Tso and lightly sautéed tender beef, shrimp, and sliced chicken in the Happy. Pork fried rice was also excellent.
Next time we will eat there and order different things.
Plus, super nice people!"}
{"text":"Food is wonderful, at a great price - we had an array of items to include General Tso's Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, Fried Rice, and Egg Rolls! The show was entertaining, if a little \"cheesy\". It's very loud in the showroom, so dinner conversation is difficult. We will definitely go back, but we'll sit in the dining room."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just moved in the area and were looking for a good place to eat for a Sunday dinner date. This place went above and beyond to impress us. Our waitress Winnie was amazing and took care of us as if we were regulars. Incredible experience - definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I love Singing Panda! Nice little sit down Chinese restaurant right in the heart of Chandler with quick and fresh take-out for those times when you feel like eating at home. Always great food, always great service."}
{"text":"SO FUN and great food. Mongolian beef and chicken vegetables are amazing. This place is a gem. No other like it in AZ."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my boyfriend. We were seated pretty quickly. We had three waiters checking on us to make sure we were served as soon as possible. Joe was super nice and the food was pretty good. The act that night was singing and was very good. We had a lovely time and Joe made sure we understood the show schedule and reservations are needed on the weekend. I am looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Love their food and love that they have fun and cheesey in a good way live music all the time. Willing to drive past other places to eat here."}
{"text":"I love this place for the quality of the food. I love the hot and sour soup as most chinese food places use a massive amount of soy sauce. I didn't care for the salt and pepper pork chops too much because I like the way traditional chinese restaurants cook it with lots of garlic and onions. Here it is plain battered. I love the texture of the pork the dishes have because they use a fatty pork and thinly slice it which keeps the meat flavorful and moist. Most food places, pork is disgusting and dry. We love the lo mein because they use a skinnier noodle. The ambience is not really for kids in my honest opinion. Very loud when there is entertainment. The prices are a bit high for the area (downtown chandler). I don't mind paying extra for quality obviously but the higher prices do add up quickly."}
{"text":"Went in last night, we don't usually easy  Chinese food out west because it's stock full of grease and God knows what else. 
This little Gem is our new spot. The Orange chicken amazing as were the Singapore noodles. Don't pass up the crab angles or spring rolls either. 
From the moment we walked in we felt incredibly welcome to the resturant. The manager owner came over and spoke to us which was a lovely touch. A young man walked around and offered us water and talked to us about our meal. 
You must check this place out its great. The food was delish and so succulent, the veg was perfect not over cooked and sloppy like alot of Chinese places around here. 
We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Fantastic Chinese food, very entertaining vocal performances by the opening act, plus the owner (the star of the show)! Service was some of the best I've experienced, anywhere. I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first last weekend, quite busy but was greeted at the door and seated promptly. Sat by the stage and was at first concerned it might be quite loud. It was not and the show was
OK.  Guy sang Elvis Johnny Cash and a few other oldies. He was good and quite entertaining for what he was. Service was great owners came by twice to inquire. Now the food had hot and sour soup, was solid, also had ka pa chicken and pepper beef. Both were good not great a little short on favor.  Same with the rice. So I would say service, ambience etc was a 5 food a 3 so overall a 4. Will try again and  order some different dishes."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place but just was not feeling it....for a few reasons. First, my citrus chicken was all gristle and not white meat chicken.  Had to chock through it.  Sherry the owner says they serve \"top quality\". That is not my idea of top quality. The waitress was not very helpful. My friend ordered fried rice with her meal.  It never came. When she asked her for rice, the waitress said there is some on the table. I ended up sharing mine which was white rice. Then 20 minutes later when we are pretty much done, the waitress brings out fried rice. The entertainment was nice, but that is in between ALL the infomercials about the restaurant, their top quality food, try their dessert, and spread the word about us."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the nightly entertainment to come check this place out. On Friday nights you get to see Elvis, Kermit, Whitney Houston and more while dining. Definitely a fun night out but the food is actually amazing as well. The calamari was deliciously seasoned and had the best texture. The sweet and sour chicken was nothing incredible but good. Kung Pao chicken had tons of flavor and had the right amount of spice. The waitresses are super friendly and are constantly refilling beverages. The performers are very friendly as well and after the man was done performing he talked to the tables individually, giving kids little panda keychains. Overall great place, make sure to check when there are performances happening so you don't miss out!"}
{"text":"This is as good as Chinese food gets in the USA. I have been to Hong Kong and this is every bit as good as authentic Hong Kong food.  This is definitely a come again place.  Cannot recommend highly enough. The service was incredible. Prices were very reasonable.  Try this place - it will quickly become your favorite."}
{"text":"Guys, this place is seriously the best! 

I just can't. The service is just fantastic. The staff was consistently checking in with us. The drinks were cheap - my wine was 4$! Seriously? The food was delicious and large portions. 

But.. The icing on the cake was the entertainment! There were two performers, an Elvis impersonator and a women (who apparently makes the sauces) and they both were great! Great performances, great song choices and they were really engaging with their guests. I would say this is one of the (if not the best) date nights my husband and I have had! 

Come here! Seriously!!"}
{"text":"Thumbs up!!! Great food, cozy atmosphere and very welcoming. We tried the Mongolian beef and chicken curry. Both dishes were super tasty. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for both family and or bar patrons as there is a cute little karaoke stage with fun decor and disco ball: )"}
{"text":"This place has the best service in town. Fantastic food. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"First time and what a pleasant surprise! Food and service was outstanding! Live music to boot!"}
{"text":"Nice clean, Friendly service and Quality food! I like children egg drop soup and really enjoyed the shrimp fried rice and orange chicken. Try it ! I am sure you will love it !"}
{"text":"My new FAVORITE!! Seriously delicious, great quality food. Period. Maybe the best I've had here in Arizona. (I grew up in San Francisco, I think that says enough about my taste in Chinese food). The place was really nice and clean (Amazing transformation from the Mexican restaurant it used to be), the staff was really nice and attentive. Overall great service. It's a fairly new restaurant and I was so impressed, I thought they deserved a good review. I'd love to see it succeed... mostly so I can always turn to it for my Chinese fix.

My friend brought me here for lunch, here's what we had:

*Hot, Green Tropical Tea - High quality, organic tea. It was presented to us in a box with vials of the teas offered so we can smell them and pick our flavor. (Wish I remembered the brand)

*Chicken Noodle Soup - oh man was it good. Broth was light but so full of flavor. No chicken fat grease/oil, super tender lean chicken breast and full of vegetables. 

*Calamari and Chilies - Amazing! I'm craving them again just writing about it. Calamari was tender, not rubbery or chewy like other places. Fried with an amazing flavor I wish I could explain, in a very, very light crisp batter served with a blend of sautéed peppers and onions.

*Chicken Lo Mein - Huge pieces of tender white meat chicken, really good. Though could have used maybe a little more salt or soy sauce but that's just my liking.

*Honey Walnut Shrimp - Huge prawns, cooked perfectly. Clearly great quality. One of my favorite dishes at any restaurant but Singing Panda nailed it."}
{"text":"Great food, great quality ingredients and good service! Now if only they delivered .... :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant reached out to apologize which wasn't necessary at all but very much appreciated! I worked in a restaurant myself and I completely understand things happen. Great food and even better service."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff & service, and really good entertainment. Glad to give five stars."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, the food was certainly sub-par.  My wife and I and a friend got a take out lunch of tofu vegetable, chicken vegetable and shrimp vegetable, all with egg drop soup, fried rice and a mini egg roll.  We only ate half of each lunch, having little taste and the egg rolls were soggy and the rice tasteless. The best part of the meal was the fortune cookie. The other reviews truly surprised me but perhaps the environment makes a psychological difference. No way could you get us to return!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is legit!!!! I have eaten here over a dozen times and it ceases to amaze me. The quality of food has always been consistent and I would recommend this place hands down to anyone looking for good Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Live entertainment was fun and invigorating! Food was the best Chinese food we've ever had. I recommend the beef lo mein, Generals Chicken, and the sweet and sour chicken. When I made reservation for the 5:30 showing she told us to come early....we came at 5:00 and that was too early. The show started at 5:45ish and we had already finished dinner. Still a blast! You have to go!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Had the spicy green curry chicken, wife had several drinks, came for bday for wife. They bright hey called and sang three times!! Twice in English and once in Mandarin!!!! What!!! Gave her a bday desert. Owner took time to sing with 2yr old. You need to come here! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Really good food and entertainment. Service was great as well. Several waitresses that are very attentive. Really fun place for dinner."}
{"text":"Friends of ours brought us here and it was definitely an experience for the better! How can you go wrong with live entertainment and delicious food?! Highly recommend if you're looking to do go and do something out of the norm. The owner is amazing, she has a beautiful voice and is the nicest person you'll meet. The staff was fun and friendly, the drinks were very reasonably priced and the food was high quality and fresh"}
{"text":"Family dinner tonight for the first time. We were excited to go based on reviews and recommendations. Entertainment was solid. Food was actually very good. Pricing was gouging!  If food wasn't good, this would he 1 star!

For our 3 children, we were charged $15.50 for their 3 drinks. 1 ordered a Dr. Pepper and 2 Shirley temples. After they finished their glasses (pint glass full of ice with liquid), they were  informed that drinks only came with one refill.  All of them held to one refill except my son who ordered Dr Pepper. He asked for a Shirley Temple as a refill and was not told that would not count as a refill. When the bill arrived, we were charged with 5 drinks. 3 of which had $1 syrup charges. 

In addition, we ordered 3 family meals - one of which was a noodle dish. We asked for fried rice for the two dishes that were not noodle based. When bill came, they charged us $1.5 for that dish. 

Any of this could be explained except when I complained, it seemed it was excuses and blame on the server versus the policy of the restaurant. This was in talking with the owner. Seriously. Stop gauging. We were planning on spending $80-100 on a 5 person meal anyways. Why try to gauge another $9.50 from us???  We'll never go back. Despite the good food.  We value morals and experience and not just food quality. 
Sad, truly sad."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Singing Pandas! Great food and the entertainment makes for a fun night! Sherry (the owner) even sang a few songs (very beautifully I might add)! The service was amazing...super friendly and prompt. Can't wait to make a reservation for a weekend night and come back with some friends! I love local businesses that do customer service right and Singing Pandas definitely does!"}
{"text":"The orange chicken was delicious and was served very fast. I enjoyed the free entertainment of Elvis. The atmosphere is relaxing. We will come back here again."}
{"text":"This is just the best place.  Delicious, fresh and authentic food.  And reasonably priced, as well.  If you go on the weekend you might be lucky enough to see a really fun show in their separate plush bar area. The owner Sherry even sings for you.   But you should call ahead for a seat.  They always fill up.  The owner is full of charm and personality.  You will be happy you have chosen The Singing Pandas!!!  Great food and fun!"}
{"text":"OMG!  Best Chinese I think I have ever had!  The wife and I tried it today and we can't believe how good it is! The orange chicken is simply amazing!  The S&S Chicken is ridiculously good as well!  I had hot and sour soup and practically inhaled it.  No mystery meat here, this is great food and quality meat.  The chicken was tender and juicy and the breaking was crunchy even in sauce! The S&S sauce is not catchup with simple syrup it's real!

I'm on my second visit in a week and it's just as good!  There was a lady here when we go here who was just beside herself and went on and on about how good it is.  I couldn't agree more!  They really put money into this place from inside out.  Parking lot is prestige.  The dinning room is new and nice.  This wasn't thrown together with used restaurant supplies.  I honestly won't be able to eat at another Chinese restaurant again because I will compare it to this and they will all fail in comparison.  The server even remembered us from our first trip.  I can go on and on but you get the idea.

Bravo!!!  To the owner: Please don't change the food at all!  Very impressive!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very nice inside compared to what I expected.  We came to early to see a show, but we were just coming for the food anyway.

The food was very good and cooked nicely.  It was a little on the sweet side, but that was probably because of what we ordered.  All the dishes that came by looked and smelled delicious.

The staff was beyond friendly and we will be coming back often for there quality food and excellent service!!!"}
{"text":"Great flavors and service.  Food is all made fresh. Clean and friendly atmosphere. Had the pepper chicken and sesame checked. Both were great. This is not your traditional take out style Chinese restaurant the food is high quality and the place is nice."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch during a trip to Phoenix. I kind of wish we had come for dinner because they do live shows almost every night, so maybe next time. 
The service was really good. Everyone was very nice and our drinks and food came out quickly.

I got the general tsaos chicken and my husband got the orange chicken. They were both lunch specials and came with soup, spring roll, steamed/fried rice, and an entree. Everything was very good. Both chicken's were hot fresh and crispy. I think I liked the orange chicken just a bit more, but I liked them both. Overall, it was very good and I would go back in the future."}
{"text":"This place makes me smile!  The live show is a nice change compared to other restaurants in the area.  My husband and I went in for dinner on a Sunday.  We made a reservation and they saved a great table for us.  We ordered the pot stickers, crab angels and two drinks to start - they came out quickly and were delicious.  For dinner we had the pan fried noodles and the Kung Pao Chicken.  I don't understand how anyone could give this establishment a poor rating based on the food.  It's delicious!  
Thanks for the friendly service, Singing Panda's!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food ever. This coming from someone how seriously misses the Chinese food back east. 

And the service is great too. Plus entertainment. Win win."}
{"text":"Food was good, entertainment was a little cheesy and loud. Made it a little hard to communicate with my family. I would sit in the dinning room right when you walk in for a nicer noise level."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful meal and look forward to coming back! The Singapore Rice Noodle dish has shrimp, chicken, pork, and eggs- it's a gluten-free, protein-packed delicious dish! Their portions are huge!! Also, definitely get the crab angels- you will never order the crab rangoons at Panda Express again. The hot 'n sour soup is great. We loved our dinner and are excited to eat leftovers tomorrow for lunch! You will be lucky if you get Winnie as your server; she is SO funny and wonderful! Live entertainment is Tues, Fri, & Sat nights, which we will come back for."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Great food and incredibly friendly service. Very clean environment! I will be going back many times and recommending it to others as well!"}
{"text":"Where to begin?! The food is AMAZING. I can't pick my favorite but we loved pot stickers, shrimp fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, sesame chicken, and lo mein. It was all so good. 
Also the entertainment was AMAZING!! So much fun and such a variety during tribute night. From Elvis to show tunes to Whitney Houston- they brought in really talented performers. The owner is insanely talented and super friendly. I plan to go see their piano night and guitar night too!"}
{"text":"So much fun! Service was off the charts. Servers were working together to make sure we were well taken care of. At one point, the owner came over, hugged my mom, and wished her a happy Mother's Day. lol Food was very good. Basic American Chinese food, but high quality. Get the orange chicken! We will be back for sure. :-)"}
{"text":"Happened upon this place right after they opened, only a few people there and we had a wonderful time.  Drove by a couple of months later and it was so packed we couldn't find a parking spot.  My birthday arrived and this was my first choice -- very glad they take reservations.

Again we had a most wonderful time.  The food is great, service is exceptional, and the drinks are cheap.  The entertainment is a ton of fun and makes me smile, which we need more of in today's world.  It is a very diverse crowd and everyone has a good time, from children to us seniors.  There's also a quieter side if you're looking for a little less fun but still want great food and service. 

I am a happy person, but I leave here even happier than when I arrived."}
{"text":"Great Chinese, cheap drinks, and a show!  What's not to love.  We usually get this to go and pick it up, but tonight we stopped in to see the show.  We had a great time and can''t wait for the later show, 730, starting soon.   I wish they had more seafood choices, but i can just switch out the meat.  We'll be back again."}
{"text":"We finally ended up visiting Singing Pandas for dinner and a show (I've always just gone for lunch) a few weeks ago.  The show was very entertaining and our kids had an amazing time.  He even came over and gave each girl a little toy panda which made their night.  Plus the food was great as usual. 

So if you're looking for something different with some fun family entertainment, this place should be on the top of your list."}
{"text":"Flavor. Lots of flavor in the calamari, Mongolian beef, and green curry chicken. Not the same-old Chinese flavors. Distinctive. Bold. Delicious. Need to add a comment about the live music on Friday. You need to listen to appreciate it. Not the usual blaring music that prevents you from having a conversation. I encourage you to try Singing Pandas at least once."}
{"text":"Visiting friends who have moved here from CA and they brought me here. Food was great but entertainment made the visit exceptional. Loved Sherry and Mike and (Liza Minnelli).  Looking forward to my next visit already!!!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place! When we walk in everyone is so nice and the food is amazing! Whether it's take out or dining in the food is fresh. My favorite is definitely the hot and sour soup"}
{"text":"This is a pretty great find. The food is pretty good and reasonably priced. I got the orange chicken extra spicy.  Meat was a nice flavor. The fried rice was nothing special.   I wouldn't order that again. The entertainment was great. My only complaint was not with the Restaruant. The cliental was mostly older. I wanted to have a light conversation with my friends as we also enjoyed the show. We were not loud and it was completely acceptable. We however, got shh'ed a lot.  Some even walked over to the table. We politely let them know we would be more quiet, but we're out to dinner and would continue to talk. Don't know if it's like that every week, but that sure weird to experience."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and it's been consistently good every single time, the food is always served to order and the servers have always been attentive and friendly. This has been my first time with the live music and it's lively and fun, definitely enjoyable and would highly recommend for a great meal and good music."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant, dinner and a show! If you call ahead you can reserve a table to make sure you're in the show room for your dinner. The staff is very communicative when things are taking a little longer than expected to cook, or they have multiple big parties ordering lots of food! 
The owner is so respectful and genuinely kind! She makes her way around to meet everyone and treats them as if we are visiting in her home. 

True gem for chandler to have this restaurant! I recommend to everyone! It's beautiful inside and very clean! Food is AMAZING! and the staff is great!"}
{"text":"Great fun and a funky atmosphere, the owner is at the restaurant and likes to mix and talk to the customers. I enjoyed the food and the entertainment.
This place will put a smile on your face"}
{"text":"Good American Style Chinese.  I enjoyed the egg drop soup a lot.  The service was good.  It's just a little over priced and I prefer more authentic style."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here and it definitely won't be the last! From the moment we walked in and were greeted by happy servers to the moment we left and got a hug from the owner who btw, has and amazing voice! This restaurant is way worth 5 stars and I can't wait to tell my friends and bring my family back. Thank you for great food, service and entertainment, Singing Panda!!"}
{"text":"Terrific place with AWESOME food! The chicken egg rolls are to die for!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but not really anything special. Your typical chinese food. Only draft beer was \" lite\" ( Bud lite or Coors lite). We were intrigued by the whole \" singing panda\" thing to get us in the door but our experience here with our Asian girl who kept upselling us was getting annoying. We finally agreed to get some pot stickers for an appetizer after the waitress said \" you need appetizer. Is very good\" . It was very difficult to understand our server but apparently she must work on commission because a meal for 3 came out to $73 ( at a chinese restaurant). I've spent well over that on sushi, etc. but not for 3 basic dishes. We ordered our meals ( Cantonese noodles, Happy family and shrimp lo mein) then server says \" what kind of rice you want? White rice or fried rice? I think fried rice better\". So we said fried rice thinking it came with our dinner. ..... Apparently white rice does but fried rice doesn't. Of course our server failed to tell us that. We received our bill and an additional $4.50 was on the bill for the rice. We get done eating and go to pay our bill and after giving my debit card to the server it comes back with 18%, 20% and 25% tip recommendations with amounts. I left about 10% along with the $4.50 extra charge for rice.  We will NEVER be going back there again. Oh, by the way. The singing was done by the owners of the place. Apparently they \" think \" they can sing but it was more of a joke than anything else and not worth the price. I recommend take out at one of the many other places nearby. Heck, I'd rather eat at Panda Express than Singing Pandas after our experience."}
{"text":"Best service ever, great food, good portions 
Super friendly staff, I can tell they have a lot of regulars. Singing is beautiful and fun."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here several times now and it is always great food and atmosphere. Be sure to make a reservation, that way you are assured a seat for the entertainment."}
{"text":"My niece and I came here on a Saturday evening the atmosphere was great everyone is so friendly! They had an Elvis singer great entertainment while you ate. We will define be coming back! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"WARNING: Will not accept their own advertised promotions. They are currently running promotions in local ads, Groupon, and Local Flavor. After talking with the owner, Sherry, they would not accept a valid Groupon which she was aware of but rejected because they were \"advertised too early.\" 

It seems they are actually trying to bait and switch customers by releasing these promotions, but not actually honoring it in-store saying \"it's not [our] fault you purchased the coupon [early]\" which has only an expiration date and begins when purchased. They then require the customer to pay full price in addition to the amount they paid for the Groupon certificate price. 

There are no messages or signs that they do not accept it; so I hope this review is able to reach and help a few people before falling for the same false advertising."}
{"text":"Great place,  friendly and food was amazing.  Best Asian food I've tasted since I moved to Gilbert.  The egg drop soup is the best I've ever had.  I had chicken curry,  perfect not too strong.  They also have great entertainment that I hope to be back to see soon.  Was so good got food to go.  Light,  perfect portions not too expensive.  Please you gotta try it!!
Thank you!"}
{"text":"Being a New Yorker, I have high expectations for Chinese food. We are new to the area and look for new places to eat all the time... This place is a hidden gem! The food is great. I try something different each time we come & have yet to have a bad meal. Love the chicken & green beans!!!"}
{"text":"Service is great and the food is excellent.  Please don't go here...........so it doesn't get so busy I  have to wait for a table!!!!  I tried it for lunch and had the Kung Pao chicken, which I use as a gauge to compare restaurants.  This was excellent with a light sauce and very tender chicken.   I thought it was true to the rating of hot (2 chili's), but I liked it.  I saw other items on the menu I will try next time.  I thought the price was very reasonable for what I got...Kung Pao Chicken, rice, spring roll and soup.  I think it should be 1 $ rather than 2."}
{"text":"Great place for tasty Chinese and entertainment. Drop on in for a delicious, relaxing, fun, and unique experience.

Great Service: You'll notice right when you walk in that the staff is welcoming and friendly. Our server was fun and had a great sense of humor.

The atmosphere feels very initmate. The lighting is soft. And the stage feels very close from where ever you sit. We were there on a Sunday afternoon. The live music was supplied by Jared Howe. He was quite good and all over the map with his performance. My wife really dug the Elvis tunes. Following his set, Jared stopped by our table to visit and even gave us a CD. Pretty cool folks.

Our food was excellent, boy did we over order:
- 2 Chicken Eggrolls - hotter than the sun, great with the sauces provided
- Hot & Sour Soup - tangy and delicious
- General Tso's Chicken - good but not as spicy as expected
- Cantonese Pan Fried Noodle - very tasty
- Fried Rice - just what you expect, but with cool tunes

Mondays always need a lift, and mine was a waaaaay better workday with my Singing Pandas leftovers. 

Darcie and I are looking forward to returning during some future evening. Can't wait to try the Kung Pao Chicken and Mu Shu Pork.

Go have a blast."}
{"text":"Delicious food, wonderful service, fun atmosphere, enjoyable entertainment. Our new favorite Chinese restaurant. Sherri the owner is genuinely one of the most upbeat and friendly restaurateurs and even graced the staged with her own lovely performance. Entire staff was very attentive, food and drinks are well prices and fresh. Will be back with friends. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A very eclectic place with phenomenal food. The service was amazing, the prices low, the food healthy and high-quality. I am picky about me and it was all top-notch. We shared the Blackpepper chicken and Kung pow chicken. The sizzling black pepper chicken which they also make with beef or shrimp is the type of meal you'll go back for."}
{"text":"We got takeout...orange chicken and Mongolian beef...it was very yummy!!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food I give a 4, service and experience a 5.  I had chicken egg rolls. They were ok.  Not really New York style but ok.  The potstickers were good.  I got them steamed. I usually get pan fried but the other option was fried.  We also had the general tso chicken. They will make it extra spicy for you.  And they gave me chili oil.  We got the moo shu pork.  My husband likes it but I thought it was a little tangy.  Great portion sizes, great drinks and excellent prices.  

I didn't realize there was a show...but watched a man do tributes to different legends.  He was entertaining, laid back. The crowd was pretty diverse.  Families, retirees, girls night out.  It was an early shoe so not an overly interactive crowd.  But it was just something different so I liked it.   The owner later came on to sing.  She sings traditional to her native country, pretty voice.

We arrived at 4:45. Pretty good seating options but by 5:45 when show starts, all tables were filled though a few tables rotated and left during show.  I'd definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent quality Chinese food. You can tell the meat is high grade. You can sit in the loud entertainment room or in booths near the front. Would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for lunch on weekends for months.  The staff is marvelous, very attentive, customer oriented, and efficient.  The restaurant is spotlessly clean.  Best of all the food is freshly made and fabulous.  We have had a different entree each time we come, and have not been disappointed once.  We have not come in the evening, but I understand it can be quite crowded particularly during the entertainment so reservations are accepted and welcome.  Enjoy this great little family owned business, our favorite Asian restaurant!"}
{"text":"Fun night out:) great food and fun entertainment!  This restaurant is spotless, food fresh and even the owner sings on certain nights:)"}
{"text":"Have only been for lunch, so haven't seen a show. Recommend the General Tso Chicken. Quick & friendly service."}
{"text":"Run, do not walk to Singing Pandas.  I am a self proclaimed Chinese Food snob.  Growing up in Northern NJ and New York City I know what good Chinese food is.  This is good Chinese Food.  For starters we had Crab Angels, BBQ Pork slices, spring rolls and Fried Prawns.

Highlights were the entrees - Mongolian Beef and Orange Chicken.  Highly recommend.  Drinks were great - Mai Tai and Long Island Ice Teas were great and strong.

Above all was the entertainment.  They don't call it Singing Pandas for no reason.  An Elvis / Neil Diamond / Louie Armstrong / Buddy Holly / Kermit The Frog / Dean Martin / Blues Brothers  impersonator serenaded the crowd from 6PM on.  

This place is very family and kid friendly. The entertainment welcomed my kids up on the stage to dance with him. They loved it.

We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Sooo good. Had the yellow curry today and it was fantastic.   Good quality ingredients."}
{"text":"We ordered takeaway and it was pretty great. We will be coming back. Especially for the show they put on. They looked really fun."}
{"text":"Great place. Food and atmosphere was awesome. The entertainment would be worth the money itself, the singers were better impersonators than most acts in Vegas. Food was good service was great. If you want to have a fun new experience I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Was a great place to eat. Food was delicious.  Glad we gave it a try. Waitress was friendly and was fun having the live music."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was awesome. We went in not expecting much. Loved the music, the food was very very good, and the customer service was so good. We live a half hour away, but won't mind driving for the fun we had!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! From the food to the entertainment- there was nothing our group did not thoroughly enjoy. Five stars from us :) we loved it!"}
{"text":"A Chandler neighborhood surprise GEM!  Singing Pandas offers a great menu and the service is extraordinary. The warm welcome, lovely service and great tasting food make this a regular restaurant for me!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great customer service, clean restaurant and restrooms, and evening entertainment to boot!  Some of the best Chinese food I've had in the 18 years I've lived in Arizona.  We had the good fortune to meet Sherry (owner) and she was more than happy to take the time to welcome us and explain the entertainment schedule.  We only had lunch, but rest assured we'll be back for dinner and the show.  Do yourself a favor and stop by for a meal, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sunday night with a large family.  We had a party of nine.  Perfect service and outstanding food.
General Tsao Chicken and Mongolian Beef were my favorites."}
{"text":"So much fun! What a great experience! The food was incredible and the prices were incredibly reasonable. The live entertainment is the cherry on top! Love this gem! Great for families and friends night out!"}
{"text":"I own a business right across the street. Five Star RV Park so when I saw so much business going on and had gotten take out a few times, so knew the good was good, figured I had better check out the show. The owner here is one smart cookie. Beautiful too!  I The show was fun. Small and intimate. The crowd all joined in for one song. I could tell there were a lot of regulars. I will go again and will tell my friends. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"It's my first time here. The place is so clean and the food is so good. The staff that served us was so attentive to our needs and very entertaining. I really really love how the pepper steak was cooked and the orange chicken was so so good. But what blown me away was the triple chocolate mousse. It melts in my mouth and the sweetness is just right. I could have two of those in one sitting. Lol

I would love to go back absolutely  with my friends who loves to eat good food just like me. This place is worth spending time relaxing while having a good food. I would love to recommend this to my friends."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in Chandler,  the food was very authentic and the entertainment was very good. We even got to hear a song in Mandarin and one in Taiwanese.

Get there early to sit by the stage."}
{"text":"The service here is Fantastic! We have always had a great experience coming here and this has become one of our favorite places. Dinner and musical entertainment. Very cool!!"}
{"text":"This was such an amazing surprise!  From the food, service and entertainment... the Singing Panda was wonderful!  My family felt welcomed and feel like we've made some new friends.  Cheers to Mike Russell for performing a spot on Johnny Cash!  We look forward to coming back real soon."}
{"text":"The food was great and the entertainment was fantastic. We are already making plans to go back. If you have not been here it is a must for your bucket list."}
{"text":"Tonight we had the combo Lo Mein, Crab Angels, egg rolls, Teriyaki Chicken, Walnut Prawns, sesame Chicken, and Calamari & Chilies. We started off with the crab angels and egg rolls. Perfectly crispy came out very fast. The crab angels are just that little angels of happiness in my mouth. The calamari & Chilies I was not expecting to be so wonderful. This is not your typical fried calamari, these are lightly breaded and fried then tossed with onions, bell peppers, and jalapenos. The taste combination is amazing why have I never had this in my life. I could eat this as a main dish. I would slap my momma for this. I have been here many times and have never been disappointed. The service is wonderful always refilling beverages. Multiple servers at once the owner takes such pride in her food, and the service everyone provides. She remembers your name and really has that personal feel like your family. This place makes my tummy smile."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with my wife and thoroughly enjoyed our appetizers and entrées. We pick the lunch special where my wife and I both received egg drop soup, rice, and our entrée. A lot of locals go there so it must be good. We were not disappointed. My orange chicken actually tasted like orange chicken not dressed up General Tso's chicken. We will be back."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service! Beyond five stars. Have not been more pleased with a dining experience for as long as I can recall. The service was phenomenal!!!  We felt like VIPs from the moment we walked in and the food was ridiculously fresh and delicious. It is obvious they take great pride in what they serve. Everything is made fresh to order. Every person we had contact with was truly a pleasure. I think one was the owner because she was so knowledgeable of everything from the ingredients to dish recommendations and was sooooooooo accommodating. I honestly feel like any restaurant would have trouble topping this experience. We had orange chicken, black pepper beef, Mongolian beef, vegetable low mein and we got the following appetizers: crab puffs (crab angels), and calamari. The food is served family style on the lazy Susan in the middle of the table. We weren't there for the entertainment as we went in the afternoon after church, but we will be back for the entertainment soon, which is at 5:30 and 7:30 each evening. This restaurant is family friendly, but would also be wonderful for a date night. Can't wait to go back. It's not super close to home, but that won't stop us from becoming regulars here. It's amazing and I'll gladly make the drive anytime I'm wanting awesome food and service."}
{"text":"The food is good, not great.... The singimg is NOT good.  It feels like a couple that likes karaoke too much bought a restaurant.  The waitress added a bunch of things on our bill like sides of rice for $4 each.  We had 3 meals, potstickers and beverages for over $70. Not worth the price tag!!!"}
{"text":"Prologue:
My fiancee and I were looking for a new Asian dining experience in our area and our online search yielded this result along with several good reviews.

The Plot:
We started by sharing the Calamari & Chiles appetizer. This was followed by Singapore Noodles and Mu Shu Pork, both of which were more than enough for the two of us.

The Scene:
The Calamari & Chiles was the familiar salt and peper fried calamari with sliced jalapenos that you'll find at many Chinese restaurants. This dish also happens to be one of my favorite starters, which I order at almost every opportunity.

Both of the entrees we ordered were excellent representatives of the essentially standard Americanized fare on the menu.
Although we love authentic and traditional Chinese cuisine, it was apparent from our obervations of our fellow diners that a more Americanized menu was both appropriate and wise for this location.

However, the owner's commitment to quality came through clearly in both the ingredients and the preparation.
The texture and seasoning of the noodles was perfect with lots of shrimp, chicken, etc.
The consistency of the pancakes for the Mu Shu Pork was also perfect, thin and moist but still firm enough to hold the pork mixture WITHOUT the juice and Hoisin Sauce soaking through (I hate it when my Mu Shu pancake leaks).
The portion size for both entrees was very generous and the result of all this was was some of the best Singapore Noodles and Mu Shu Pork we've had in a long time.

The Rest of the Story:
The best part of the evening, though, was the live entertainment.
If you'd like to experience the feeling of being in a cozy, family owned restaurant in just about any large city in Asia where entertainment while dining is a must, then this is the place for you.

The star attraction was the owner herself who sang several popular songs in Mandarin, Cantonese, and English.

The service was also great and the prices are very reasonable.

Epilogue:
The quality of the food and the generous portion sizes easily deserve 3 stars. The live entertainment and the owner's charming personality merit an additional star.

We had the pleasure of chatting with the owner after our meal and assured her we would most certainly return.

{"text":"Too much fun! My mom and I stopped by after reading the good reviews. By accident we showed up right before the performer hit the stage. How fun is it to be eating dining while watching Frank Sinatra, Elvis, and Johnny Cash performances, all by the same guy?

The service here was really phenomenal. While there wasn't an obvious hostess stand, we were greeted quickly after coming in and asked if we wanted to sit on the 'noisy side' or the 'quieter side' (basically, did we want to sit near the little stage near the bar or in a separate dining room). I think all the staff members came over at least twice to check on us and they were super friendly, sharing their favorite dishes and telling us to stay and watch the performance for as long as we wanted after they cleared our plates away.

Their food was yummy! I loved my 'cream cheese angles' (cream cheese rangoons basically) and the fried rice. I don't eat meat but I know what good meat looks like - my mom's plate looked like high-quality white meat chicken. They have a pretty traditional Chinese restaurant menu with lots of vegetarian options. It isn't super fancy but it tastes good! Definitely worth a visit, make sure you go in time to catch a performer. The atmosphere is really what makes this place!"}
{"text":"Being from LA, I am used to top quality Chinese cuisine.  There are so many Chinese restaurants here and so many are just ok. Only a few are great.  This is not one of them.  The food is alright. Not great. Not terrible. Just ok. The service is good and friendly. The entertainment is so bad that it is embarrassing to even watch it happening. I feel so sorry for the entertainers as they don't get it that people are laughing at them and not with them. So bad, that I will not eat there at night time."}
{"text":"very very loud you can not even talk ,,.. the food is ok  they ask you to tip 20 to25%will   not return.......ps also the place is very small .."}
{"text":"Not only do they have the best food around, but the entertainment is amazing! Thanks Sherri!"}
{"text":"Saturday night and not very crowded. I don't understand why. The food is very good. Portions are so big that 2 grown ass men split an appetizer and a entree and it was plenty. Good selection of local, domestic and Asian beers. The kicker is thentertainment 6 nights per week starting at 6 pm. First is a dude named Mike who does about 15 different artists from the king to Kermit the frog to Dean Martin. Good stuff and entertaining. When he wrapped up Sherry the owner took the stage. Sherry is a hell of a singer no matter what dialect of chinise she chooses to perform in. In summary, this is a great place to bring a. Date, the family or a party to have a good time."}
{"text":"So much fun!!! My whole family had enormous smiles on their faces when we left. The singers were so entertaining and wonderful. The owner sherry is beautiful, delightful and her voice brought me to tears- so amazing. The food was incredible as well. Everything was perfect. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Asian restaurant!  Great food, fast-n- friendly service, fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today with my husband and daughter. Food was tasty, for appetizers we had fried dumplings and beef skewers. Entrees we ordered orange chicken and Kung Pao chicken both cooked to perfection. The customer service was wonderful. Everyone was nice and always checking in on you, and your drinks will never empty. The best part is there is live entertainment from elvis and the owner even came to our table, introduced herself and made sure we were taken care of. They deserve the 5 stars, we will be back here in the future."}
{"text":"This is a must stop! Whether you're with adults or the family you'll have an amazing time. The atmosphere is more then welcoming. The live music is very entertaining. The food is extremely tasty and the service is outstanding! The thing that sets this place a notch above the other restaurants we've been to in the Phoenix area are the people. This is the second time we've been in and it felt like we were part of the family! We visit once a year for spring training and will make this an every year experience. My kids had an amazing time. They truly care about what they're doing and it shows."}
{"text":"First timers and we had a great experience.  The food was better than your average Chinese restaurant and reasonably priced.   With that said, I ordered a cocktail, $7.50, very tasty but  definitely on the weak side. Mongolian Beef was delicious!  Probably the best I've had.  My husbands General Tso was good too, though comparable to most places.  I took a star off because while we enjoyed the food and entertainment, we felt very rushed.  We figured it was so the show could begin if that's the case, they should inform guests of that upon arrival.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The first time visiting and was an awesome experience. Highly recommend this place. Great for a date or a party."}
{"text":"We've only ever had takeout so I can't comment on the entire dining experience, but the food is consistently delicious and the staff is always extremely welcoming and friendly.  The Mongolian beef isn't chewy and has a slightly sweet flavor that we enjoy.  The veggie Lo Mein had the perfect amount of greasy goodness you'd expect from the dish.  Soups are always hot but the hot and sour could have just a little more punch.  All in all a solid choice in the neighborhood when you're craving 'cheap Chinese'."}
{"text":"This is just based on takeout.  From the other reviews, I have to eat in the restraint to really experience what they have to offer.

So it was Chinese New Year, and I wanted to eat Chinese food.  We usually order from Yao's, Wongs in Tempe, but we wanted to try something new and the wife heard from her co-worker this place was good.  

I ordered the normal stuff as the kids don't really like experimenting with different foods.  Mongolian beef, orange chicken, salt pepper pork chop, happy family, fried rice, and Singapore rice noodle.  

When I get there, this place is packed.  I am not surprised as it was hard to find any parking and it was Chinese New Year.  I enter and this place is rockin with someone singing karaoke.  Walk towards the register and there are already 2 people that had the same idea of ordering take out.  I wait about 10-15 minutes before my food is ready.  I was told it was ready at 6pm but it doesn't come out till like 615.  Not a big deal as they seemed busy.  Surprisingly everything fits in one box.  Did I order enough?

Get home and start unpacking.  First glance, the portions seem tiny for the amount paid.  All in all the food was OK.  Nothing really sticks out.  The kids like the orange chicken and finished the salt pepper pork chop.  But everything else was hard to remember.

I am always down for some good Chinese food so next time we try this place, I will tell the family we have to eat in.  Hopefully I can come away with a better feeling from my wallet and stomach."}
{"text":"Top quality Chinese food. Honestly, seeing it next to a tire shop made me wary about the quality of food, but it was probably some of the best Chinese I've ever had. And the entertainment is an absolute blast. I could not have enjoyed my experience more and I can't recommend it enough if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. 
Recommend to everyone I talk to.
Great prices. Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, we weren't sure what to expect when we walked in because of the location & the businesses close by. Our friends highly recommended this restaurant so we wanted to check it out. When we stepped in, we saw that it looks very clean & elegant. We were immediately sat at a table & our server had lots of recommendations when we asked her about the menu.

We came here last weekend for lunch & we had the BEST customer service! We were always checked on by the different staff members to make sure that we were enjoying our drinks & food. It was like being at a really good friend's house -- all of the servers were so welcoming & friendly.

We got a couple dishes that we typically order at Chinese restaurants. Probably some of the best Chinese food I've had here in Arizona. Coming from a very traditional Chinese family & my father as a former chef, I was highly impressed. I'm picky about flavor & Singing Panda's was spot on. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to give only 3 stars! There was so much going for this place. Clean, friendly staff, entertainment....they missed the mark with the most important part of a restaurant - THE FOOD! Beef chow fun was dry with not enough sauce. Fried rice was fair and not tasty. Sesame chicken was very good though."}
{"text":"This place was a total surprise.   So the neighborhood gets one star and the business gets 5 stars.   Friendly good service and really good food.  We can't wait to see their live show its sounds fun.   They really did a good job on the interior and the bar/stage area even looks inviting."}
{"text":"I have never had Chinese food like this before, it has a weird texture in the beef w broccoli and the general tsao chicken also had a weird texture. The rice taste like day old rice and NOT Jasmine rice like it states on the menu. I ordered here because of the reviews. I couldn't even take a 3rd bite. Never again. It was awful and disgusting! Sorry just my honest opinion."}
{"text":"We came to celebrate my 51st birthday. Great time, GREAT food, wonderful service! We love this place! Dinner and a show! Wonderful music... American and Chinese songs. We had a fantastic time!"}
{"text":"Finally a really good Chinese restaurant in chandler !! Have loved every dish I have tried. Super friendly staff as well. Takeout is fast"}
{"text":"So grateful that the Yelp email let me know about this place. My husband, four year old son, and I dropped in yesterday for lunch. The outside decor doesn't draw you in (\"Smile You're on Camera\") but the food will jell you coming back. We shared the Vegetable Lo Mein, Mongolian Beef, and Szechuan noodles. They were all delicious! There is no children's menu so we had leftovers for the little guy but we still got out of there only spending $39 - my husband had some beer. Full service bar, excellent customer service, fun entertainment, and fantastic food. Welcome to the East Valley, Singing Panda!"}
{"text":"Simply the best Chinese Food I have found in Phoenix. 
It not a fancy place in Scottsdale.  Run by Chinese immigrants. Plus the entertainment lots of fun and service is very attentive.  We love it."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Chinese food ! Always delicious and fresh and the service is wonderful !"}
{"text":"Good entertainment good service and great food. Six of us all had a different entree and everyone enjoyed their food. Place is exceptionally clean and everyone and everything in good repair. Was surprised at length of entertainment(over2hours), but enjoyed it all."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and read really great reviews, so we decided to try it out. This place is amazing! Sherry, the owner, makes you feel right at home and is so warm and friendly. The food is delicious and the staff is amazing! They kept coming by to ask if we needed anything and made sure we were happy and taken care of.   My little daughters really enjoyed the show and food as well! We are so happy we found this place. We will definitely be back! Thanks for a great time Sherry!"}
{"text":"I am not a big Chinese food fan, but the food here was pretty good. The atmosphere is what makes this place though. When we went there was a gentleman who pulled off the Elvis look doing a lot of older songs (Elvis, Johnny Cash). It was entertaining."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We had sesame chicken with vegetable lo-mein. The service was kind of slow, even though they weren't that busy. The prices are high for Chinese food, and the portions seemed small. Lower the prices, or make the portions larger and I would give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a Chinese restaurant that cooks the fried rice to my liking and this one topped the charts. I also ordered orange chicken and it was hands down the best orange chicken I have ever had!!!! Definitely recommend this place, can't wait till they start delivering might order more often"}
{"text":"The only Chinese restaurant with live entertainment in chandler!  Great selection of wines and beers.  Everything is just amazing!!"}
{"text":"We visited this place during a family stay-cation. First impressions from the outside was alright. The area is a little run down but don't let that fool you. The inside is nice and well kept. The food here was very good. Not the best Asian food I have ever had but certainly far from the worst. We had the Egg Fu Yung which was really good. The real reason that you come here is for the entertainment. Our show started with a guy who changed into lots of different costumes and sang different songs. Then the owner came out and sang. I had read in previous Yelp reviews that she loves kids and that is absolutely true. Not only does she have a beautiful voice but she invited our 4 year old daughter to come up on stage with her and dance for two of her songs. The customer service is also out of this world. You have a waiter but everyone who is working that night stops by your table at some point to check on you, say hello and see if you need anything. What a fun, special experience this was. I will say that if you are hoping to see a show you might want to call ahead to see what times the shows are that night. When we got there the show and just ended and we had to wait about an hour for the next one. Which wasn't a big deal because we had time to order and eat before the show."}
{"text":"Nice place and a very different ambience. Food was not very outstanding but the staff was very warm and welcoming. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I read so many reviews on this place and have never tried it. We were in the neighborhood and didn't realize how close we were and timing was perfect for lunch. When we walked in, the atmosphere was tasteful, setup for the nights event of Karaoke (live entertainment). The restaurant seemed very clean and the service was very good. Keep in mind this is a VERY American Chinese, which was actual quit good

We ordered beers while perusing the menu (their beer selection is excellent!) We ordered off the regular menu (not lunch menu), the Hot and Sour Soup (serves 2), Chicken Egg Rolls, and the Kung Pao Chicken. We requested the Kung Pao Chicken be extra extra hot. All the food came out hot and all tasted fresh. The least favorite was the Chicken egg Roll, dry and bland. The Hot and Sour soup was good, though it needed some thinly sliced pork and more Black mushrooms and Golden Needle. The Kung Pao Chicken was good overall the best.

Atmosphere, nice and clean, service very good, food good, When I'm craving American Chinese I would try it again but different dishes next time."}
{"text":"Finally a Chinese restaurant with live entertainment! I went here with my family for my birthday back in January on a recommendation. This place was packed, but we did get a table pretty quickly. The service was slow, but I can see past that because it was jammed packed in the dining rooms. Food was excellent as were the beers. Live entertainment with a guy singing songs by Neil Diamond and other famous people. Great stuff. Enjoyable evening with family."}
{"text":"Staff is amazing! We went on Christmas and they were packed. The staff remained so efficient & friendly. That in itself was impressive. And the food! The quality was spot on. Try the tender beef & broccoli (with carrots too! Nice Touch). Also try the Singapore rice noodles, lots of shrimp, chicken & BBQ pork all seasoned just right. Can't wait to return & see the entertainment & of course, try more entrees. Yum!  Thanks to everyone at the Singing Panda for a great dining experience:-)"}
{"text":"Ok, we are visiting my brother in Chandler and he takes us to Singing Panda. I swear we live in Los Angeles. I have no affiliation with this restaurant what-so-ever. I didn't get my meal at a discount in exchange for my review (shame on you Amazon). And I received no promotional consideration, other than a fortune cookie, in exchange for my review. This Panda place delivers a Vegas quality lounge show that's so good, that one might reasonably expect it to come with crappy food. This is not the case. The food is truly excellent. We ordered 6 or 7 different entrees for our table and each was distinctively delicious. You can really tell that great care was given to the creation of each dish. So, you'd think with great entertainment and great food, maybe the service would lack at least a little. You'd be wrong. First you have to understand that they seat about a hundred people all at once. Then they take about a hundred orders all at once and then, about 15 minutes later the food comes flying out. They have an army of servers who swarm the tables with poetic synchronicity. By the way, one of those servers is the owner, Sherry, who trades in her servers jeans and T for a lovely evening gown and serenades the audience into a state of involuntary bliss to close the nights show. This is one of the greatest examples of ingenuity, courage, and flawless execution of a business plan you could ever find. I am so impressed with this place. Go experience this place before you have to wait months to get a seat. In this day and age of Yelp, Google, etc. businesses like this tend to explode. Thank you for a truly memorable experience. I dine out way more that I care to admit and this was one night I will remember for a long long time."}
{"text":"Came based on yelp reviews and so glad we did! Food was excellent, show was fun. Best Kung Pao chicken I've ever had. Lettuce wraps were also fantastic. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We got here early before the show started so we got good seats before it got crowded. Very friendly staff and excellent food , Mongolian beef was super tender and flavorful. We are definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Came here once and really enjoyed my food. The service took a long time but it was extremely busy. The portions are large. The live music was fun and different. I would come here again!"}
{"text":"Nice new addition to Chandler. Strange location in an old taco shop that you would never know what was there before.  Nice surroundings and very clean look. 
Pricing is very good especially for the amount of food served.  We asked about string beans and were told not on the menu but would be glad to make for us and they were very good. 

Very busy for a Sunday night.

Had the hot and sour soup which was served in some fun crocks and the soup was very good.  Also had the mu shy and the Kung pal chicken which were very large servings and very good flavor.

Had enough left over for another full meal. Full bar with very reasonable prices.  This is a real find for the area."}
{"text":"Found a hidden gem in Chandler!  I highly recommend this family-owned restaurant. They have excellent food, service, and entertainment. They use high quality meats, homemade sauces, and fresh vegetables cut daily. The difference in quality is obvious. Sherry, the owner, has created a welcoming and fun place for the entire family. She also performed, singing beautifully in three different languages. Mike Russell's Legends Tribute Act was also performing the evening we went, with entertaining renditions of songs from Elvis, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Cash and more.  He even brought our 9-year-old son, an aspiring comedian, up on stage, which made his night.  What a great place!"}
{"text":"I live about 2 miles from this place always drove by it, but never tried it. So we finally tried it! It was really good. I wasn't disappointed at all. Every dish had lots of flavor we had about 7 diffteny dishes. (Beef Chow fun,eggplant &tofu, generals tso chicken, house fried rice, egg Rolls, walnut prawns and Mo Pa tofu) can't wait to try more off the menu."}
{"text":"Chabdler's best kept secret! Blink and you may miss it.
This was such an incredible find. First off the food was AMAZING. 
We ordered spicy calamari. Kids killed it. Cripsy pot stickers. Citrus chicken. Orange chicken. Sweet and Sour chicken. Fried rice. Vegeteble low me in and Spicy Tofu and Eggplant. Did I say the food was AMAZING? 
Huge portioms. Went hungry and everyone still had leftovers to bring home. 
Service was spot on. So friendly and welcoming you felt like you were old friends. 
Now the show... And ambience. Great kitschy throwback Vegas lounge feel in the showroom /bar. The singer was entertaining (Legends) and we can't wait to go back and enjoy the extensive wine and spirit list. 
We came for my 9 year old grandsons birthday. Kids loved it. Adults loved it. 
All around great experience. Prices are SO reasonable. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place, it's a little far from where I live, but totally worth the drive! They have great vegetarian options! My boyfriend likes the Ma Po Tofu"}
{"text":"We came for lunch and I got orange chicken and jasmine rice. Husband got Mongolian beef and fried rice. Both of our meals were excellent and the server was awesome. We also got to see Frank Sinatra, Buddy Holly, and George Strait perform. ;) We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, fun entertainment and inexpensive.  My new favorite Chinese place!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. Food was good and very friendly service. The only thing we would like is the food to be served hotter. Other then that  good."}
{"text":"Very nice place Chinese restaurant. A little bit loud, but food was delicious and service was good. Have vigeterian option for the vigeterian people out there.
Most importantly, they have nice shows at night. I enjoyed that on a Friday night, but not sure how often do they run it."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with a new group of people we just met through our social group. The food was fantastic and the service was great! The place that was much smaller than it looks from the pictures on yelp. It is not a place to go if you want to talk at all when it's during the Showtime. Was quite loud and we had to yell to one another. I've heard the entertainment is fantastic. The main entertainer was sick so we had a fill-in. He was good... but again it was too loud for the small space.  We may go again but we would sit in the second room."}
{"text":"I've been looking for authentic Asian food for a long time, I've finally found it at Singing Panda, everything was fresh and well prepared, the staff is very professional and  accommodating.
I recommend if you want a want Asian experience try Singing Panda!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and open minded ness will find you some really good food and people! Love this place check it out."}
{"text":"I decided to come here for my birthday dinner because I saw the high ratings on yelp. I recommend making a reservation so you can get a good seat next to the stage. The Chinese food here is amazing. Best Chinese food I ever had. I don't usually eat Mongolian beef but this place's Mongolian beef is so GOOD. My girlfriend and I enjoyed the show. We loved the Chinese music."}
{"text":"Wow! So the food was great, the service was wonderful and the entertainment was an amazing bonus! The bartenders and waiters were so friendly! The friendliest of them all was the owner who also provides the entertainment for the evening. Wow what an amazing voice she has! Also they have a guy that sings Elvis songs as well as several other classics from other artists! What a unique place and I am so excited that we found it. It's a great place for all ages and I hear that they do you take reservations so make sure to give them a call. We will be back! :-)"}
{"text":"Great service...great food...great prices!  We came at prime time dinner time and my family of 4 got seated right away. We ordered the pan fried noodles, sizzling rice soup, BBQ ribs, walnut prawns and beef in black bean sauce.  The flavors were all amazing and made from fresh ingredients. Our server was very attentive and made sure our drink glasses were already full! I like that kind of service!  Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"You should not judge a book by its cover, so don't judge this restaurant by its frontage. The decor inside is modern and clean, the food is fantastic and the service is very attentive without being annoying. Good selection of beers and has a full bar. They advertise entertainment at night but haven't experienced it yet."}
{"text":"Great new spot w/ live entertainment. Had a good time with the kiddos, food is good. Peppered Steak could be better. Teriyaki and orange chicken was bomb tho :) 4.5 Star Rating IMO"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've ever had! The one thing that stands out to me about the food here is how fresh it tastes. Usually when I go to a Chinese restaurant the chicken is a questionable rubbery texture but I could tell right away that they use fresh quality chicken for their dishes. Chicken egg roll appetizer was excellent, had General Tso's for entree and it was nearly impossible to stop eating it. They supply live entertainment which is always nice but if you desire a quieter setting the other half of the restaurant is away from the stage. Definitely going to come back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Everything (food, service, atmosphere, singing)) was very average. It was something different, I'll give them that. I think people over 70 would enjoy this place though."}
{"text":"Any restaurant where a house full of foodies will go almost every Friday has got to be 5 stars!  We love this place. The food is incredible, the staff is super friendly and helpful and the owner loves people!  The food is by far the best Asian food that can be found in Chandler. We will continue to come here."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time here refered by friends. It was great!! The service was attentive and very friendly. The food was delicious. We had the Kung pao chicken extra spicy (you can order different stages of hot which is awesome!) and the Mongolian beef . Both were soooo good! Very fresh and flavorful. They had a pretty good selection as well. We've been trying different Chinese restaurants for months now and decided this ones it!! They had live music, lounge singing if you will with a kick of comedy. The owner walked around welcomed and spoke to everyone personally. She also sang on stage. Afterwards she walked around again!!! and thanked everyone personally!!! It had such a great vibe!! Loved it! We are officially regulars for Singing Panda thank you so much for a great night!"}
{"text":"Hello Yelp,

I have been to Singing Pandas twice, both of those times, we waited at least an hour for our food. The first time me and my wife ate at Singing Pandas we waited at least 45 minutes for our food, there was no wait staff available. I gave Singing Pandas a second chance, but the second time was just as bad as the first time. If you want decent  service, please do not go to Singing Pandas.
Go to Panda Express instead of Singing Pandas, you would get the same quality of food but with better service."}
{"text":"I am hooked on their Egg Foo Yung. The best ever. The rest of the family has tried different things on the menu and loved everything. The service is the best. We are usually greeted by the owner as soon as we walk in. The entertainment is pretty good too. 8 thumbs up from our family!!!"}
{"text":"What a delightful place. First of all the service is amazing. I have never seen such attentiveness in a restaurant. The Mai Tai's were oh so very tasty. We had 3 different appetizers to share. All were excellent. The entrees, all went home as left overs, because the portion sizes are abundant. The chicken is tender and sliced perfectly thin. The vegetables are perfect in every bite. 
Sherry the owner, stopped to check on us several times. Then there's the entertainment. If you want to be entertained while you eat Chinese food, this is the place to come. It is a really fun show. 
I will definitely be back to the Singing Panda! Thanks for opening in Chandler!"}
{"text":"An amazing local treasure. This is the best kept secret type of place. Live entertainment, excellent orange chicken cooked to perfection, attentive staff (never let or drinks get below 3/4 and the cleanest establishment we've seen. The owner is simply the nicest and most giving person you can meet. We can't say enough about this place. We'd recommend this to anyone. We'd even drive across town to go here again. We'll be back many more times and we'll bring others. What a treat!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California and our friend brought us here. It is amazing! The service is amazing and very attentive. The food was came out quick and it was delicious. The portion was very generous and the sauces were top notch. Sherry was so sweet and caring. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Great go to for Chinese food when in the mood.  Excellent service, very friendly.  Food: sweet and sour chicken, Kung pao chicken, egg rolls, fried rice.  All tasted great, the chicken is much better then others."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great entertainment! Sherry is great! She makes you feel like family the moment you walk in! It's a must!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, food and prices.

The entertainment is amazing, but make sure you reserve a table in the stage/singing room.

The service is awesome -- they work in teams of 3-4; you will have a refill on your drink before you know you even needed it.

The food is great and extremely reasonably priced.

This is a great spot -- highly recommended for all ages."}
{"text":"This is a real find.  Great food - very friendly, courteous and helpful staff (pretty unusual for a Chinese restaurant).  Interior sleek and pleasant.  Pretty good trip from Scottsdale but well worth the drive.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Nothing too special. I ordered the Kung Pao, the veggies weren't even cooked. My husband ordered the yellow curry, not good at all. 

After sending it back, they fixed the problem fast and recommended schzwen beef. Very tasty. Although, the portion was small for the price. 

We will probably go back but I think they need to work on a few things."}
{"text":"There are many aspects that are supremely memorable; the food is outstanding, the entertainment is lively, and the staff is sincere.  This place has become our go to restaurant with friends and visiting family.  The Beef Chow Fun is outstanding, as well as the Green Curry chicken, but everything that we have been served with has been excellent.  Save room for the Banana stuffed pillows with ice cream and whipped cream.  A delight that is large enough to share if your willing."}
{"text":"Super average Chinese. 

Gross egg rolls with a very odd tasting spice.

The portions here are quite small in comparison to other Chinese food in the area.

Flakes were fine but nothing amazing here.

For better look to: Beijing Palace, Magic Noodle House, Schechuan Gardens or Chous."}
{"text":"Good was amazing. We had the sesame chicken. Very reasonably priced. We were there during the live entertainment and it made it even better."}
{"text":"Been coming here for few months now,  and its been consitently great.  Tried many different dishes, and all of them are delicious n well prepared..  kudos.. 

Entertainment can get fully reserved,  so plan ahead.."}
{"text":"Most entertaining Friday night in a very long time! Visiting friends in Chandler who suggested we try Singing Pandas and it did not disappoint. The food was delicious and the entertainment was so great. Make a reservation on Friday if you want to watch the show cause it filled up. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"What can I say the best Chinese food I've ever had and I'm a picky eater me and my family never had a better time PF Chang's watch out the neighborhoods a little sketchy but don't let that put you off"}
{"text":"We tried this place on Saturday evening. I recommend the crab angels. They are insanely delicious. I got the Mongolian beef, husband had Kung pao chicken and we ordered the chicken and veggies for the kids. The service was excellent and the food was even better. We will definitely go back and make a reservation for the stage area as we didn't know there was singing that night. Prices are reasonable and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here. Great service, friendly staff, really good food! We started with crispy-fried pot stickers, then ordered Happy Family with egg fried rice, while hubby ordered both the Mongolian beef & Sweet & Sour Chicken. All very tasty! We'll be back with friends to try their lunch menu."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed this place before considering it's one of my favorite go to for when I'm craving Chinese! I guess I'm just always so excited that I forget to snap a pic! I'm not a fan of
Orange chicken like at all but I could eat this places orange chicken all day long! They also do a really nice yellow curry to satisfy my Thai craving when me and the boyfriend can't agree on something."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to check out. The service is great. Menu selection has a good variety. You can tell the quality of ingredients is good. The meat was fresh. Veggies were crispy. They have 5 stars for a reason. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Can't help but love this place. I can't figure if the food is better  than the entertainment or the entertainment is better than the food. I've brought my car club several times and we keep coming back for more. This establishment is unlike any other on the valley I highly recommend reservations and coming on Tuesday, Friday or Saturday to see the Legends show.  Oh did I say the food and entertainment is marvelous? Everyone is so nice sometimes I come to get take out and end up staying !!"}
{"text":"Love love this place great entertainment fantastic food you can get gluten-free without cross-contamination Sherry the owner is amazing and her and her husband are amazing singers we always go here at least twice a month and if we have anybody that comes into town that's the first place we take them thanks again Singing Panda Resteraunt the great service food and entertainment love you guys."}
{"text":"Clean, great service and food!  The fried tofu was amazing...fresh, crispy and light.  I had the chicken with green beans, my son had General Tsao chicken.  Both dishes were fresh and had tender chicken and properly cooked veggies.  The portions were perfect and the rice was property steamed and sticky!  

I loved the live music in the background, it was a pleasant volume and fun to listen to.  Everything was fresh,  clean and the service was beyond good.  Everyone was attentive and pleasant. I'm already craving the tofu, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, great prices, and the live music was a nice touch.  Can get real busy real quick and limited waiting area."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant! The food, the service, the entertainment...all awesome and so much fun! This our go to spot for out of town guests as well as fun family dinners! 

We love you Sherry!"}
{"text":"Stellar service for a surprisingly good Chinese restaurant located in a shady as all hell building/parking lot. But never judge a book by its cover. The food was very good, entrees come in large portions, and it truly isn't that expensive. We got calamari with peppers which though listed as an appetizer, is more of an entree to be eaten with rice due to all the onions and bell peppers on the plate. (I made a lemon, salt and pepper sauce to add to it and it's delish!) We also got the general tso's chicken which came in a huge portion, and was pretty tasty, and the sizzling black pepper chicken which we substituted for beef. Sooo yum. I'm happy I found a chinese restaurant I actually like and will definitely come back!! I want to check out the live singing shows!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I found this place on yelp and took our small kids for dinner .  I'm happy to say that I am so glad we did because the food was good but the service was great! The staff was so friendly and nice to us and our kids! It's great for families and dinner! I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Not my favorite atmosphere, took my food to go. The flavor of the beef, chicken, and shrimp in the fried rice seemed a little off to me and the chicken and shrimp were steamed and not pan fried. I did not like the street noodles."}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest and admit that I was extremely skeptical of this place. I was so pleasantly surprised. First of all, the drinks. The drinks about about $5-7 for cocktails which is awesome as they were served within 2-3 minutes of ordering. The service was prompt and so was the food. The best part of this place is the food and the entertainment. I think this will be my new take out Chinese food and a fun place to come on the weekends."}
{"text":"Singing Pandas has a nice selection of Asian cuisine. The portions are generous for family sharing. We love to order the Kung pao, it has just the right amount of spice! Food is very fresh tasting!"}
{"text":"Really good Chinese. I've only ordered takeout and everyone is always very nice. I've had the orange chicken and is is very delicious and the low mein with chicken. I order it spicy and it is also amazing."}
{"text":"Just finished eating at the Singing Panda with my wife. Great fresh food, nice entertainment, and the service was very good. I highly recommend this restaurant for date night."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 4-5 stars. This is the third time I've had dinner here. The other two times the customer service was decent and the food was good which is what brought us back. 

Tonight, I wish I could give it zero stars. I'm only giving it two because the little old lady that was serving drinks was sweet and kept those drinks full. 

We got seated and then were asked to stand back up again because they didn't realize two other parties were ahead of us. Okay fine no big deal they sat us within 5-10 minutes later. We order a couple appetizers and our food...35 minutes later still no appetizer. We ask about it and they say it's almost ready. Another 15 minutes the soup comes out still no calamari. Long story short, we waited close to an hour for an appetizer that ended up coming out lukewarm and another 20 minutes after that to get our food. 

Every employee avoided eye contact until the end when they apologized. Didn't offer anything, or comped the appetizer at least.

Sadly, their very poor customer service is a complete turn off to this pretty good Asian food."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The food and the service is outstanding- plus you have a FREE Las Vegas style lounge act that can't be beat.
Sherry and Mike are very gracious hosts and entertainers.  We can't wait to bring more friends and family to this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the state. Portions are great and food is delicious. Anyone that asks about Chinese food, I send them here!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the entertainment was fun! Service was very good too! Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Let's talk quwirky, entertaining, and good food.  
Hi! 4 stars because the food for me is not wow, great, but good.  
Now, the entertainment = 5.  Once you get past yourself questioning, 'Is this really happening?' You will absolutely love the charm of the performance, Kermit making an appearance, and the helpful, kind staff.  It's a great entertaining spot for kids to dine.  It's not a jungle gym, but rather entertaining for adults and kids and good food.  And if they happen to get up, they won't get scolded or sneered at by staff.  Great spot.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We really loved this place. Boy are they on top of customer service! They checked in on us often and had great food suggestions. Not to mention the awesome show included with your meal! What a great date night restaurant! We ordered the Cantonese noodles and the Kung pao chicken and they were both delicious. Plus they were huge portions... you could definitely split at this place. We will be going back for sure;)"}
{"text":"Sunday lunch with wife. 
Started with the sizzling rice soup. Have had better, but this wasn't bad.
Crab puffs were really good.
Wife had sweet and sour shrimp, and enjoyed.
I had Hong Kong style pork chop, which was quite tasty. Cut off the bone battered and nicely fried. Not at all greasy.
All food here presented very clean and simple.
Servers very nice, and overly attentive.
Really enjoyed live music by Jared Howe, made the afternoon better!
Looking forward to return soon."}
{"text":"Very nice decor, friendly servers and the best beef and broccoli I've had. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had the most epic rehearsal dinner here with our wedding party and our family. Everyone commented on how good the food was and it was an absolute blast. Great service, entertainment and food. Our friends and family will be talking about our rehearsal dinner here for a long time."}
{"text":"We went to this place for the first time on a Thursday. We were greeted quickly and the staff was very nice. The place was pretty slow but hey, it was Thursday. The food was good, very Americanized Chinese. Honestly some of the best I've had in a while. They have a second room where they have live entertainment most nights, we'll be back to check it out."}
{"text":"Surprisingly clean and service is def 5 star worthy!

Food was really good, fresh, flavorful and staple Chinese options.

Fried rice a bit bland which cost them a star.

We will be back on the regular :)"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant since my husband and I moved from CO!! Food is really good quality which is hard to find these days. Clean and very friendly staff. I will not be going anywhere else for this kind of food. You will not be sorry..."}
{"text":"People enjoy coming here because the food is excellent and the place is off the beaten path. This isn't your \"typical\" Chinese food establishment. The QUALITY and taste is there and your food is made to order.  Brace yourselves.  It's quite addicting."}
