{"text":"I ate there one time and had to take my wife for our anniversary (less than a week later)! As everyone had said the mozzarella sticks are insane! My wife is an alfredo fiend and discovered her new favorite. The service is fun and personable and even helped me do a little something special for my special day. 

Thanks MAMA!"}
{"text":"Great good! Great for families! Loved the Sausage Rigatoni. The Mozzarella Cheese Sticks are to die for."}
{"text":"I love the fresh made mozzarella sticks and how warm and inviting the atmosphere is.  This is a great place to host events because of the open concept.  Renee and her staff are phenomenal, this is now my go to place."}
{"text":"I wish the owner good luck but this was less than a favorable dining experience. I have nothing positive to say about the food quality, price or portion size. Lots of good intentions went in to this place but they need one of those reality chefs to help them save the day."}
{"text":"Completely felt like home the second you walk in! great atmosphere, AMAZING super friendly customer service...where else can you show up and get a big hug from the owner who doesn't even know you?!  The mozz sticks and sunshine fries are a must have!! Please do come and give this place a try!! You will not regret it. We will definitely be back, Mama Renee!!"}
{"text":"The best kept secret in the West Valley. This newly opened restaurant has an atmosphere that makes you feel like you're at home, the service is second to none and the food is prepared  fresh each day with the freshest ingredients around. If you have not experienced this  locally owned and operated new restaurant you need to get over there ASAP.  Mama Renee's Is currently open from 11 AM until 8 PM Tuesday through Sunday, closed Monday."}
{"text":"Wonderful Italian place! Everything is scratch and made to order. Loved having the different options available - even down to how I wanted my spaghetti cooked, al dente or well done. The mozzarella sticks are to die for! I also enjoyed the charcuterie board. Very kind, attentive staff as well and Mama Renee stopped by and made sure we were happy. Can't wait to go back and try the make your own pizzas and Alfredo sauce! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Looks like this place is history.  Sign on the window today said they were locked out by the landlord. Not good!  I was not thrill the first time, however thought I'd give them another chance...but I guess not!  This building has a bad history so perhaps this is whaT happen here AGAIN"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! The staff was very attentive and never missed a beat.  We met Renee and the chef who were both very nice and obviously passionate about this venture. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by a few days ago with my girlfriend to try this new place out. We walked in to a buzzling restaurant but were still seated right away. Service was very attentive and made sure we had what we needed! We ordered the mozzarella sticks by recommendation of other Yelpers and I must say, made from scratch is definitely the way to go. Definitely got a good cheese pull from the first bite. Was absolutely delicious. We also ordered the flat bread, which came out with olive oil and vinegar. There was too much ginger for my taste, so I picked it off and I enjoyed that as well. My entree was the pasta diablo, and I had cleaned my plate off quite nicely. Good taste! Mild kick, definitely something anyone can palate so don't hesitate to try that. Mama Renee stopped by to talk to us a few times and told us about her plan to develop the restaurant. I'm happy to see how this place develops in the coming months! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has great food. Atmosphere is really geared towards families. Large kids play area and many tables set to accommodate parties of 6 or more. 

Its really about the food though. Diablo pasta is excellent. Rigatoni with sausage was very good. Creme Brule is very good as well. We went here twice in one week. Glad they came to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Mama Renee runs around the whole place to brighten up everyone's day. It's a homey feel and the mozzarella sticks are as good as everyone advertises. The food was delicious, freshly made to order. If you have any dietary restrictions, just let them know. You'll be surprised at what they can accommodate.  They're planning on adding live acts and lip sync battles.  Overall, good food and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"I would give them five stars for heart and effort but only three for service and food.  We are so excited to have a new 'no chain' place to dine on the west side. MR's is located in the old Famous Sams building. 

When we arrived they had a sign advising to please be patient.  The restaurant was almost full and the staff was running around. 

We were seated by MR and loved her energy and knowledge of the menu. We quickly ordered drinks and she sold us on the Mozzarella sticks. One drink came right away and we had to wait for another ten plus minutes for the other two drinks.  The mozzarella sticks arrived and they were fantastic!  However, the sauce was ice cold and we had to send back twice. Third time was the charm and it was hot but we had already finished gobbling them up. 

Entree:

Skillet Lasagna - was super cheesy and would have preferred more sauce. Side of meatballs- they were less than tasty. 

Pasta Diablo - was good.  I think this was the best entree of all three. The side of bread should be toasted vs. cold.  Or come with olive oil or butter. 

Chicken Alfredo - Chicken needed more seasoning. 

MR and our server were very open to feedback.  MR was very sweet to take off our drinks and appetizer.  We were not expecting that. 

Decor:
Loved the open concept.  It was a bit dark in there.  The curtains were closed but maybe open them up for a bit more natural light. We noticed some of the tables near the windows had the opened a bit.  

With a couple more months under their belt, I am sure they will works the kinks out.   We will give them another try later on in the summer."}
{"text":"This place is a gem in the rough!  Do not miss this culinary delight!  For starters, the mozzarella sticks are so good, they make fresh mozzarella daily.  The meatballs and specialty fries are also delish.  If you like a little spice, the Pasta Diablo is off the chain!  Equally spectacular is the chicken fettuccini. The pizza features made in house dough from scratch. There is no wrong move here. For dessert, Gelato, Crème brûlée and the Chocolate, Raspberry Mouse are phenomenal. And let's not forget about the real show stopper, Mama Renee!  Renee is an absolute sweetheart and visits every table. Do not miss out!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time this evening.  Was greeted immediately by MaMa Renee.  Great touch for a family owned spot.  We were seated by Jamie and asked if we would like a drink?  We ordered our drinks and a side of scratch made meatballs which were good and a great starter.  I then asked if I could get a small plate of plain pasta with butter parmigiana cheese and cracked pepper to try out the pasta?  Jamie said she would ask and returned and said that the chef would put it together for me and boy did he!  It was great.  For dinner we ordered a roasted Garlic, fresh mozzarella, red onion, and bell pepper pizza, and a larger serving of the special Pasta Described above. Obviously the pasta was great again, the Pizza was actually pretty good.  Did I tell you that I am not a big fan of Pizza?  So pretty good is a big deal!  However like the sign says great customer service, and make sure you talk to MaMa?  She is the kind of \"different\" that will make you smile.  Great lady.  So if around 59th and Bell and craving Italian, this is a must stop!

By the way if you get a sweet tooth try the creme' brûlée.  Pretty DAMN good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere like being at home. Renee is AMAZING! 
Food is scrumptious!! If you haven't  been get there definitely and try try the mozzarella sticks and the mango habanero wings, if you can't hot the lemon pepper are delish!
My favorite place"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside turn you away. The food is amazing and tastes like it is \"made from scratch\" like they say it is! We had the Pasta Diablo and Mac and Cheese and both were delicious. 
They explained that they quietly opened in order to work out the kinks and it definitely feels like a start up, nothing fancy but the food was far above! We'll be back sooner than later for sure!!"}
{"text":"I just happened to be in the neighborhood of 59th Ave and Bell and came across Mama Renee's Restaurant. This is what a family restaurant should be about. The food is fresh and made from scratch. Their mozzarella is made in house! That may be a lost art but not at Renee's. (Tip-must try the mozzarella sticks, to die for) The staff is great and Mama Renee has a heart of gold. Even got to meet the chef, super cool. This is a must stop when in the area. If I lived in the neighborhood, it would be a regular stop. Go check it out, I promise you will love it."}
{"text":"Absolutely scrumptious spaghetti and meatballs.  Sometimes when you enter an Italian American restaurant, you can find they have bland and tasteless spaghetti and meatballs and Italian food.  I truly LOVED this dish and almost ate it all in one sitting (i never do that) The service is on point, and Mamma Renee is such a sweetheart and would go out of her way to do anything for you!  I would recommend this place to anyone and I would suggest it to anyone searching for a place to do an event!  Will definitely come back for sure and have referred my friends.  What a hidden gem this place is!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. We had the Pasta Diablo and Rigatoni. It was recommended that we try the fresh made Mozzarella so they made us a Caprese salad. Very good. The seating is a little too open for me but we will be back to see the progress of their \"Dream!\""}
{"text":"Great new Italian restaurant. The sauces are great and the pasta is good. We tried the mozzarella sticks and bruschetta board for starters. The mozzarella is made in house and it's very good. Worth the trip just to try the cheese. The owner approached us and was very welcoming. We tried the pasta diablo, chicken Alfredo, and pizza. The diablo was our favorite. For dessert we tried the lemon mint cake and the creme brûlée. Both are flamed at the table! We will be back"}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was all delicious... Service was great and very attentive. We had mild buffalo wings, mozzarella sticks, Sunshine specialty fries and pizza. My favorite was the sunshine specialty fries they are tossed in honey and lemon zest so good to the last bite. Pizza is crunchy. Mozzarella sticks cheesy and the wings crispy. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Closed landlord tenant dispute
6-19-18.  Heard good things about the food  and location.   Hope the dispute is resolved."}
{"text":"The minute we walked in to Mama Renee's we knew we found our new go to place!  We were instantly greeted by Mama Renee herself with a hug and a huge smile.  Her energy and passion for what she is doing at the restaurant is infectious.  There are so many exciting things happening at this new family oriented restaurant, the kid zone is a perfect area for kids of all ages, there is a game area with comfy couches, books and board games.  On to the food.  The food is delicious, the menu is not overwhelming and everything is made from scratch, I highly recommend the mozzarella sticks they are fabulous.  Chef Steven visits the tables to make sure the food is to your liking and you can tell he really cares about customer satisfaction.  If you are looking for a new place that is not a chain, that is truly family owned and operated then this is the place for you!  I am so excited to see Mama Renee's grow..the vision is exciting and finally we will have a true family oriented restaurant to call home!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Spacious dining area. Food was fantastic and reasonably priced. Our waiter was very attentive and the owner stopped by several times to make sure everything was fine. I was there with a group of 7 and everyone was pleased with their meal. I had the Fajita Pasta, Cavatapi noodles with chicken, bell peppers, and onions tossed in a fajita inspired sauce and topped with melted cotija cheese. It was spicy, but very palatable. I would definitely order it again. This restaurant is not visible from the road and is a few hundred yards away from the popular Italian chain restaurant Carrabba's. I hope it succeeds."}
