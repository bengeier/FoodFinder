{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome and very laid back, and the chips and queso are the best ever. Drinks are a tad bit expensive but overall a great spot"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new restaurant in Davidson, and decided to try Carrburritos after a friend's recommendation.  It reminds me a lot of Qdoba and Chipotle.  They have a similar menu and you place your order at the counter.  I had a shredded pork burrito, a side of guacamole, and a salsa sampler.  The pork was incredible, very juicy and flavorful.  I'll definitely have the pork next time I'm there.  My toddler usually loves guacamole, but wasn't a fan of the guacamole here; since it was spicy with jalapeños. If you like spicy guacamole, it's delicious with a lot of flavor.  The owner gave us a complimentary salsa sampler, which was a lot of fun to try.  I tried the three mild salsas, and liked all but the verde salsa.  They have a large salsa section and I was impressed with the uniqueness of the salsas.  I ended up purchasing a to-go order of the pineapple salsa.  Lastly, the chips are served with a few flour tortilla chips that are delicious!  They were between a tortilla chip and a pita chip.  The downside of Carrburritos is that they aren't located right in Downtown Davidson, while they are on Main Street."}
{"text":"Another great dinner at Carrburritos in Davidson....try any of the margaritas....Chad does a great job.

Also the house made chorizo in a quesadilla is out of this world and the slow cooked beef and pork are amazing on nachoes or in tacos.

I agree that some of the chips are larger than the others....but as a chef, this is what defines \"made in house\".....thanks Carrburritos"}
{"text":"Very good fish tacos with corn tortillas.  And good fruit salsa went great with it along with good guacamole.  And the service and friendliness of the staff was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great food and great staff.  Fresh food that will keep you warm in this cool weather. Owner is actively involved helping his team. This is a great addition to Davidson."}
{"text":"Fantastic drinks, great food and an awesome staff! Love having margaritas on the outside patio area. If you haven't yet, you need to try this place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Carrburritos! Every time I'm in Davidson, I stop by and grab my personal favorite: a naked regular burrito (naked = a burrito bowl) with chorizo with three salsas, usually frutas, chipotle, and verde. It's delicious! The chips on the side are incredible, too, and you'll usually get a few freshly baked pita chips, which yumm those are my favorite. If you're in the mood for a drink, their margaritas and sangria are great, too. Just thinking about Carrburritos makes me want to go back there asap. The only frustration is that the line can be surprisingly slow, but it's totally worth it for those tasty naked burritos. Way to go, Carrburritos, and thanks for coming to Davidson!"}
{"text":"This is a delicious addition to Davidson. Ever since I discovered this gem, we eat here at least once a week. Love the freshness of the tacos or the burritos. Didn't really like the quesadilla's very much. Only criticism is that you get a feeling of being nickel-dimed when adding things. Example- charge for a dolup of sour cream. It's not cheap but it is good."}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite, we try to make it here at least once a week.  Everything is fresh.  They have specials each day that add to the already amazing menu, great drinks (margaritas especially), fresh salsas with a very good range of flavors and heat, and the staff is always very friendly.  And of course the burritos are the best!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how to even start this review. I'm in a bit of disbelief as to how bland the food was at this restaurant. We had beef and fish tacos, rice and beans. You have to keep going to the counter for salsa, because you are given only a teeny bit at the register when you pay. Really, it didn't matter, because even the salsa had no flavor. We only got more because everything was so dry that it needed something... anything. It was also very expensive. $30 for lunch. Even if the food at Taco Bell seems like it was made days ago it has some flavor and is doesn't cost as much."}
{"text":"Carnitas cooked perfectly. Habanero sauce is amazing. Grilled shrimp tacos were very very tasty. If you haven't tried Carrburritos, stop whatever you are doing and get over here, now!"}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to the neighborhood. The food is good, the line cooks are nice and funny, and their beer/wine/margarita selection is great. However, they do need to work out a better system (or train the hostess better) for making sure that people keep that playing card with them and for getting drinks to guests (and - are you supposed to clear your own table?). We've been there at least 6 times and every time the hostess forgets something, whether it's our drinks, telling the bartender we ordered drinks or our playing card thing. Otherwise, it's great and definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Their fish tacos never ever fail. Plus their queso/salsa mixed is super delicious! Very much so recommend that as a pregame to tacos!  I always appreciate great ownership and management and I can for sure attest that this place is owned by genuine folks. Cheers"}
{"text":"Delicious, fast and family friendly dinner spot in Davidson. Workers are always pleasant and friendly!"}
{"text":"Carrburritos is a fairly new restaurant in town and I will admit that on our first couple of trips in the \"new\" was very evident. Service has improved immensely now that the staff is a bit more experienced and this spot has become a regular for us.

Everything is amazingly fresh from the salsa, to the chicken tacos, to the margaritas. I've enjoyed the Grilled Vegetable Quesadilla on several occasions but the Baja Shrimp Tacos are my new favorite! Lots of flavor and just a touch if heat. 

Also, if you like heat you must try the Flaming Orange Marg; it's a winner for sure! For those looking for a cocktail that's a bit more mellow but still packs a punch, the Million Dollar Rita is always safe bet.

It's disappointing to see some of the poor reviews on here for such a fantastic, but easily misunderstood, restaurant. Yes, the ordering system takes a little getting used to but the staff is super friendly and is always  will to help direct you along; just ask.

If you haven't been its a must try and if you have been but weren't impressed initially, this spot is worth a second chance."}
{"text":"First time here since living in TX. Great ceviche...fresh and loved the jalapeño kick. Paired perfectly with the \"Fresco\" margarita. Carnitos tacos also fresh and flavorful. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The place to go for great  Mexican food, great margaritas and a comfortable atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area but Carburritos is my go-to spot when I don't feel like cooking for the family. My toddler loves the chips and salsa verde, my sweetie and I take turns having the nachos (they are huge). The orders are generous, the service is friendly, the atmosphere is jovial. I was there today (a Tuesday!) and the place was jumping with energy and there was someone singing live. My sangria was a bit underwhelming (no fruitiness), but my shrimp tacos were excellent, with fresh fresh fresh vegetables."}
{"text":"As a Davidson resident I was excited to have a local mexican restaurant in town.  We visited on Saturday night and the restaurant was not very busy and ordering was a snap.  The quality of the food is no better than Moe's but much more expensive and Chipolte is way better.  Will probably give them another chance to be sure but won't expect much."}
{"text":"Mmm.... Que rico! Delicious, fresh Mexican favorites served here. Plus, Carr serves large portions, so you have another meal for the next day too. Bonus! The best part of the experience are the folks who work here. They are so kind and accommodating. This place is great for fast, casual Mexican favorites. Try their nachos and shredded beef quesadillas. Their salsas are all fresh and delicious also. This place is la bomba! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"On spring break from Nashville to visit some friends and happened on to this jewel when another restaurant was closed for lunch. We were so glad it was closed because this little Mexican place pulls no punches.

The gal who waited on us was an absolute delight, extremely helpful and very generous with portions. 6 different salsa combinations to choose with 6 different levels of heat. All with their own unique flavor. 

Everything is fresh each day! This is a place I wish we had in Nashville. If you're in this area it's well worth the visit. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good service and a cool atmosphere!  They have some cool live bands on a weekly basis. I recommend the fish tacos and you have to try the sweet potato dip! Its Awesome!"}
{"text":"Carrburritos is hands down my favorite place to eat in Davidson well LKN area really! We eat here usually once a week. More often than not I get a shrimp tostada No dairy with Jalapeños and Guacamole and it Never disappoints! We like to come on Thursdays for Tequila Thursdays! The Fresca margarita with muddles Jalapeños is amazing! Kim and the rest of the staff know how to treat their customers. I feel welcome every time we walk in the door! The service is amazing, the staff is great and well the food is terrific!"}
{"text":"Wow! What A great find. I've driven by there many times but never realized from the sign that it was a Mexican restaurant. 10 of us ladies enjoyed dinner and drinks on the patio. Every single one of us raved about our meals. It was a great evening.

The server was excellent and very friendly and so was the atmosphere on the patio. I found the food to be very fresh and flavorful.  It's priced very reasonably. This is the place to go if you want to try dozens of different types of tequilas and creative margaritas...over many visits, not just one. I know I will be back and look forward to trying all the delicious items on the menu."}
{"text":"Best margarita selection in the greater Lake Norman area. Try their new #1 rated version made with basil and watermelon....yummy."}
{"text":"OK, so the food is great, but the service is terrible. I have certain dietary restrictions and can't do dairy or beans. Whatever, I just get food without it. But, here, when I order the tostada, even though I order it with no sour cream, no cheese, and no beans, they still charge extra for adding a few radishes, red peppers and cilantro. Not only that, but they're incredibly rude about it. The food when it comes tastes great and has nice presentation, but I really don't want to go back because the people (minus one nice gentleman that was there busing our table) simply make me feel too unwelcome. I would not recommend this place to my friends because of this. I think kindness first and this place does not exhibit that quality at all, which is really unfortunate. :( And this is the third time I've given them a chance."}
{"text":"Quality food and killer margaritas. It's nice to have a Mexican restaurant where the food makes you feel good."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous, food was so tasty and everything was farm fresh. The atmosphere is wonderful and their margaritas are out of this world, seriously. Great staff is the cherry on top! Tip of the hat to the proprietors on a creating such a hip and satisfying experience, bravo"}
{"text":"Great stop for some Mexican fare in a very pretty college town.  Pretty good prices too.  I had the fish taco (Baja style) and it was delicious!  The salsa was very fresh as well."}
{"text":"Awesome local burrito spot in Davidson. Huge portions and yummy food. Love that they mix corn and flour tortilla chips. Was slightly disappointed that there were no taco tuesday specials but the did have a few drink specials. Overall yummy, average priced date night spot. Would definition go back."}
{"text":"Million Dollar margs.  Delish.  Shredded beef quesadillas.  Yeah!
Great little place."}
{"text":"This is one of those places we have passed no less than 100 times. Each time we comment to one another that we need to try it one day. Yesterday was the day. And we should have tried it sooner! Easily some of the best Mexican food I have had in the area!

When we walked in, I was surprised to see that the line was set up similar to a Chipotle or Qdoba. But, for the cost, I was ok with that quality of food. The gentleman behind the food bar asked what we wanted and we admitted that this was our first visit. He welcomed us and showed us the specials. Before he could move on to the regular menu, we both decided to go with the special, Taco Nachos, which was described as a healthy mix between a taco and a nacho. He then asked what we would like to drink. My fiancée said she was thinking about a beer and stepped away to look at the selection. There he stopped her and advised us that we might be happier going around to the bar where the bartender would be happy to make us some of their award winning Margaritas. How could we say no? He was very persuasive, even going as far as to tell us the years they had won.

To be honest, as large as it is, we would have never noticed that large wall with the Margarita flavors until after settling for beer. It was wonderful for him to clue us in! We sat at the bar and he introduced us to Ashley. Ashley then proceeded to echo how wonderful the Margaritas were and listed her two favorites. I decided on the Mojito Margarita, which substitutes Cilantro for mint and Tequila for Rum, while my fiancée went with the recommended Blackberry Margarita. Both were delicious! I could taste just enough of the Tequila to know that they had not skimped on the liquor, but not enough to overpower the other flavors. Mine was the best Margarita I have ever had! 

Then came our food. Much larger than I had expected and far above my expectation for flavor! I reckon that, now I've tasted Carrburritos, it will become a go to when I am craving Mexican."}
{"text":"Great burrito. It wasn't greasy nor dry. Very spicy, in a good way. Good salsa too. Good prices"}
{"text":"Luv the food, not so much the weird table clearing service.
We love coming for yummy, fresh though slightly overpriced Mexican food (of course, there is the higher overhead/rent in Davidson).  Recommend it with one caveat:

On multiple, (like 3) occasions though when I take my young daughter to the restroom, we've had our partialy eaten food (and worse!) glass of wine cleared by female staff.  At least twice it was the same gal, maybe all 3.  It's sort of creepy...the first time we chalked it up to she just wasn't really paying attention....but the other times, I've arranged silverware and napkins to indicate \"still eating\", made eye contact as we walked to restroom and this last time even hand motioned that we'd be back.  Only short trips to restroom too!  The employee just kind of laughed about it, not even apologizing.  this last time, I pulled the drinks out of the tub just as she put them in...it's a really weird scene and wonder why they aren't more careful?  I mean who has time to wait for another order of food because it got tossed while we were away for 6 minutes?  and who would toss a pretty full glass of $9 wine?  

Hope this part improves because we love the atmosphere, fresh fish/food and choices."}
{"text":"Fresh food, lots of options and awesome margaritas what else could you ask for. we drive passed this place all the time and finally tried  it, we are so glad we did we will be back many more times. THe shrimp taco's were excellent and the chips and guac was on point. Definitely recommend it ,so go there and support a local place not Chipotle."}
{"text":"Stopped in Davidson driving south to GA. Staying in nearby hotel. Craving Mexican ordered to go. Chicken burrito, beef burrito and kids beef taco. Burritos were huge and delicious. Kids beef taco was devoured in minutes. Ginormous brownies that were wonderful. Manager was super nice!  Huge portions well  at great price.  Definitely stopping here next time we drive through."}
{"text":"I've only had the burrito with shredded beef, but it is so good I get it over and over.

I'd say the prices are very reasonable. Quality ingredients and great tasting food.

Atmosphere is nice. Bar has a decent selection of craft beer.

Free chips and salsa with every burrito, which is a huge plus. Also, the burrito is filled with a lot of meat and not a ton of filler like Chipotle, Moe's, or Qdoba. Wishing they had Queso to put on the burrito though. The salsa fresca is also a little watery, but tasty. I also don't like that  they don't make it right in front of you and you have to wait a little but, kind of awkward.

Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I've had carrburitos many times before but this
Time was disappointing. We got some food to go and the quality was sub par. All of the nachos were soft and mushy, who wants soft nachos? Also, there was a sloppy arrangement of cheese and carnitas on top. We got two orders of quesadillas (one chicken and one shrimp), which comes with lettuce, tomato and sour cream. There is not nearly enough of this provided to top the quesadillas, which had barely any flavor to them. All around, it was a disappointment for out of towners with poor quality food that was overpriced."}
{"text":"Not many Mexican style restaurants use fresh veggies but this one does! Loved their fish tacos especially since they had fresh tomatoes and romaine lettuce on them. They also have great Margaritas (tons of different flavors and ingredients!) and special prices on Margarita Mondays!"}
{"text":"I walked into Carrburritos and immediately felt at home. If you've been to their Carrboro location, you'll feel the same sensation -- the smells, the decor, even the location are somehow reminiscent of Blue Heaven. I came here for a concert (Time Sawyer, who was awesome) instead of dinner, and it had a good vibe for a small local concert. They have a great bar area with a few TVs for watching games (college basketball, anyone?) and a huuuuge wine selection that made me very happy. 

The setup was a little weird for watching a concert -- only people who snagged tables for dinner had a view of the band -- but I enjoyed listening to the band even though I couldn't really see them from my seat at the bar.

I'll be back for their food (and wine!!) soon. Very soon."}
{"text":"Folks do a good job. Food is great, predictable, and a nice change. Always glad for a quick lunch and dinner. Fresh ingredients + great vibe!"}
{"text":"First of all, food is exorbitantly overpriced for a simple Mexican meal. I appreciate the mindfulness behind the ingredients, but the follow through in this business is disappointing. I frequent this restaurant because it is so close to my home, but am never pleased with my eating experience.  You can expect to wait 20 minutes for your meal even if there are little to no people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"So Good! I love this place. The Salsa de Arbol is the best and I wish it was sold canned in jars to take home! I have had tried a wide variety of the menu options and margaritas and never leave disappointed. My go to is either a Chorizo nacho with rice, or a chorizo/chicken mix in a burrito. Nom Nom, give this place your money."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed Carrburritos! This place is so good. I get variations of the same thing every time because I enjoy it so much. Today I had a mejor burrito bowl with pollo asado. Comes with a side of chips. I'm always super full when I leave, which is great since we get two plus drinks for around $20.

The food always tastes super fresh which is awesome for a local place. Sure parking is sometimes crazy, but that's Davidson and not a reflection of the business. 

I've also stopped by for drinks before and they were solid. 

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a great find.  The staff was very helpful and accommodating, and the food was solid.  Wish is took pix of the chorizo and marinated chicken tacos, but was too hungry and they hit the spot.  The pineapple salsa and have habenero salsa accompanied the tacos perfectly.
Really enjoyed the atmosphere while on spring break!"}
{"text":"I've had this place at least three times before, all of which I was overly satisfied with. Meat can be a little dry, but the rest makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Disorganized on a Sunday afternoon,  though not busy.  Food was a goodish value, but the overly cheesy quesadilla was very... taco bell... overall not a bad option,  per see,  but not memorable or particularly positive in any way. ..

EDIT: My bad,  it was 2 weeks ago Saturday.  Not Sunday."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here recently, the food was delicious! First off, I really appreciated the staff let us sample each of the different meats since we had never dined here before. My personal favorites were the shredded beef and the chorizo. I ended up ordering a quesadilla which was four HUGE pieces. I was only able to eat one, plenty for leftovers or a meal to share between two people. We also shared a side of the queso which was enjoyed by all. Five stars for Carrburritos!"}
{"text":"As a California native, good Mexican food is a crucial part of my diet. If this restaurant were in California, it might be lost amidst the vast number of outstanding Mexican restaurants. However it really shines here in Davidson, NC. 

I had the carnitas burrito, which was extremely flavorful. I would say it's comparable to Chipotle, but definitely has a little extra flavor. Meat was very tender, and the veggies inside the burrito were fresh and crisp.

The really winner for me was the salsas. I sampled several of varying heat levels, but the ones that stood out were the habanero and the chipotle. Excellent blend of heat and flavor. The owner said that his wife's sister came up with the recipes with a friend from Mexico, and I would say the flavor is on par with his story. 

Overall a great eatery if you're looking for a little spice in life."}
{"text":"So fresh and very yummy! The flour Tortilla chips are to die for!! Particularly love the friendly staff and great service. Thanks y'all!"}
{"text":"Moving here from CA, we gave up on finding a Mexican place that Doesn't include a pool of refried lard and a heap of orange rice as filler on every plate. There is so much more to mexican food than that crap. Carrburritos offers just that. Numerous selections of fresh options...I chose Ceviche' (yes, ceviche...if you don't know Google it...) and two fish tacos. Fish in tacos nicely grilled and plenty of marinated fish in ceviche. Wife loved her grilled chicken tacos as well. 

Chips were a bit different in some seemed thick, some thin, but all homemade! Seven very different salsa really rounded out the meal.

Atmosphere is casual but nice with a small bar in back. Bright and open...they use an order line setup vs table service. We had no issues with any of that. prices were fair for what we had...$7.50 ish for most meal options (not sides). Bill for two was about $25 (including ceviche appetizer)...normally it would be less because we'd order less.

One suggestion: a bit too heavy on the raw onion in both the dishes and salsa...would be nice if they used a lot less and let people add it to taste as a garnish instead.

All in all, we liked it and are happy to have found a nice place with options that are clearly a step above the usual crud served elsewhere."}
{"text":"Who says you can't get solid Mexican food in North Carolina? Had a veggie 'mejor' burrito with extra guacamole and it left my belly happy. What Carrburrito really does well is their salsas - Salsa verde and the habanero were both mouth-wateringly good. Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"The place was packed this past Friday night, which is always a good sign. My wife and I were meeting some friends and we all got there at different times, so it was nice to all be able to order separately in the - what I call - Subway-fashion (stand in line and add toppings if needed as they make your food). The menu is very simple to order from, but offers a lot of options. I had a regular burrito with shredded pork. No complaints, a very full and delicious burrito. They also give you a handful of chips and salsa. They have regular corn chips and also have flour chips mixed in as well, and the two salsas I tried were fantastic. 

Definitely a great recommendation if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"So I have been to Carrburritos a few times for lunch.  Each time I go in thinking maybe this time it will be better and... each time I leave I say yeah I don't need to come back here for awhile.

The food is pretty good, I have more of a problem with the ordering part.  It is set up like how you would order at a Chipotle but you don't order like Chipotle.  You give them your whole order up front, pay, get your drink and then sit down with a card and they find you and bring you the food.  I wish they would make their ordering like Chipotle so I could have what I want put on my food.  I also feel the place is a little pricey for what you get, except for the nachos.  If you get nachos, you will get a HUGE plate of nachos.

So overall, know what you want when you get to the counter and if you are really hungry and don't want to spend a lot, get the nachos."}
{"text":"Well, based on the vast number of 4 and 5 star reviews, it is clear to me that I am in the minority.   I so wanted to have an Mexican food experience that was \"out of this world\".   First off, I am not a fan of the cafeteria style eatery, I want to sit down and have a server work my table.   I found it hard to tip beforehand, as I had to pay up front.  Furthermore, once sitting down, I had a hard time getting someone to my table for an issue I had (no big deal, I ordered rice and beans and it did not come out)  Read on my fellow Yelpaholics.....

I wanted to start with the good.

5 star for salsa.  OMG, the absolutely best salsa I have ever had.  Salsa Fresca was just delicious.  Salsa Habanero was knock my socks off, lips vibrating, tongue numb and sinus draining hot.   But, in a good way, it was atomic nuclear hot, but had lots of flavor.  See my pick.   Bonus - all salsa is AYCE and free.  Yas pleez, fill me another.

5 star on homemade and hot nacho chips.  They have thick ones and thin ones in the bowl, I was digging the thick ones with the Salsa Hab, great flavor and perfectly lightly crispy.  

5 star on some damn fine tasting queso, dare I say, probably the best I have ever had.   You might think, queso is queso, it is hard to screw that up, wrong answer, I have had some really awful chunky, cold, milky, curdy crap that was on the menu as queso - just sayin'

5 star on the staff, these kids are awesome.  Each one had a great personality and looked like they were enjoying themselves.

5 star on personality, the spot has a trendy hip vibe, the bar area is totally cool and a great place to chill.

Now the other shoe falls.

3 star on lack of flavor in the meats.   Carnitas really had no discernible flavor.  I see Doug, the owner, has responded to a similar comment about the lack of flavor.   I get you slow roast your meats, in my case I found it bland.  Sorry.    BTW, a big thank you Doug for responding to Yelp reviews and supporting the Yelp community.   The same can be said for my wife's fish taco.  Sure it was huge, but it lacked flavor, she did put the wonderful salsa on it, which helped tremendously (her words).

3 star on overall value.  I am not sure where these Yelper's are eating their Mexican, but I found this spot to be pricey.  I am not sure where Adam B. eats his Mexican, it is definitely not half the price of sit down traditional spots.   La Unica, Chico's, El Toro, Las Mertas Tortas, Taxco - are all way less expensive. That is a fact, check the menus.  I am not saying they are better, because some of these are awful, just pointing out this is a higher end Mexican restaurant that is comparable to Verde in Huntersville.  Case in point, you cannot find their prices anywhere online.  IMHO, I think I went overboard an added to much.  It is kind of al la carte, I like extra extra extra.  So I nickel and dimed myself by adding extra queso, guac, extra sour cream, etc, etc, etc......  My bad, but I still do not have to like it.   

So here is the show stopper.   $15 house pitcher of margarita was pure mix, I tasted zero tequila.   I don't know, again, based on the numerous reviews saying the margaritas are the best in Lake Norman, I cannot help but think this is a one off.   No idea.

Anyway, this is just my wife and I humble opinion of our exerience.  It is a great spot, with lots of energy.  Would I recommend it, absolutely, would I go out of my way to go back, not so sure."}
{"text":"This place is aboustely amazing!!! My most favorite restaurant and very close to home if your looking for some good Mexican food and a nice cold drink you should try this place you will get addicted"}
{"text":"This little place was super fresh, and super yummy! So many choices for fillers in your taco or burrito. Their house made salsa is excellent. We walked away feeling like we ate relatively healthy, not over stuffed and we didn't spend a fortune (We have kids) and the bonus is the food was actually good."}
{"text":"Carrburritos definitely earned their title of best margaritas!  Sit at the bar for a great time experience.  The nachos are huge and definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Great addition to Davidson NC.  Good beer selection.  Game is on the tv on a Saturday afternoon.  Casual mexican -- slide a tray down.   Very friendly service.   Chips and salsa excellent.  Immaculate bathroom.  We will be back.

Arrived mid-afternoon and was treated like a king.  I liked the atmosphere a lot.   Food very good."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! It's in a great neighborhood with cool shops and eats within close proximity and the food is great! They're pretty consistent and have a wide variety of American Tacos, Burritos, Ceviche, Quesadillas, and many more! 

My favorite is their Pork Carnitas in a Burrito or Quesadilla and they're not stingy with their portions. The ceviche was delicious and fresh and the Sandria wasn't bad either. They do have a full bar and they have a nice adult lounge section. 

They're very friendly and attentive and they'll let you sample pretty much anything. Great Spot!"}
{"text":"Went there with friends-from-work this week - fantastic experience! Food was great (I had the steak burrito), price is great, atmosphere is lively and inviting, parking was a snap. We were able to hang out, enjoy time together, get drink & salsa refills. Especially loved the writing on the mirror in the women's bathroom! Taking family tonight - sure to become our new favorite family restaurant!"}
{"text":"I lived in Carrboro and loved this place so when I moved to Huntersville I was excited to find there was one in davidson!  I even had my birthday dinner there this year with an amazing margarita!

Seriously some of the best nachos around !!!"}
{"text":"Visiting North Carolina from New York and stopped into Carrburritos for a little mexican cuisine with my friend, as per her recommendation. 

There are many different options to choose from. Carrburritos offers many \"fillers\" to add to your meal. I got a salad bowl with tomoatoes, onions, carnitos, black beans, guacomole and cheese. They gave me chips on the side, was great to dip into the bowl or into their many salsa options. Once you place your order and pay, the servers will walk over your meal. My friend and I also indulged in a pitcher of margaritas. While they were tasty, they were very sweet in taste and weak on the tequila. 

All staff members were very sweet. They went out of their way to say hello, check-in during the meal, and create conversation (of course our convo related to my New Yorker-ness and my horrible comparison of the restaurant to Chipotle, haha). 

I really enjoyed that they had some outdoor seating and their location. You can do a little shopping or sit outside with a pitcher of margaritas when popping in here. This place makes for a nice afternoon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here twice and both times, we have been overly pleased.  I am a huge fan of their quesidilla and my husband loves the tacos.  Very nice service, environment and food.  If you have a chance go here to eat.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"As one from out of town, I was pleasantly surprised my experience at Carrburritos. The restaurant is a large space with high ceilings, industrial feel, attached bar and an open layout. 

Upon entering there is counter ordering service, large food prep station, and it is easy to imagine large lines during lunch and dinner rushes.  We stopped in for a late lunch and were quickly able to order. 

Our party of three each order different items including varieties of chicken and fish tacos. Additionally we ordered chips, salsa, and guacamole. They have an extensive homemade fresh salsa bar that you can continually visit to add to your chips and additional items. The salsa varieties were well rounded and we tried each one featured that day. All were very flavorful and none disappointed. By having so many salsas they essentially have something for everyone. 

When our food came out it was freshly prepared the portions were much larger than we expected and we quickly enjoyed the meal. Everyone had good things to say. The tacos were overflowing with fresh vegetables and quality prepared proteins. This place is a nice local option that is comparable to the large Tex-Mex style chains like Chipotle.

Additionally, if you are in the mood they have a large full-service bar and lounge where you can enjoy both margarita style drinks as well as other cocktails and alcoholic beverages. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with our experience here and would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"We tried for the 1st after driving by several times and following on Instagram. Was not disappointed. Place was very clean. The people were very friendly and attentive. I tried the shrimp tacos and was very happy. My wife tried a mix of tacos and she was pleased as well. We definitely will be back"}
{"text":"After reading a story in the local paper I was excited to try out this New Mexican joint in Davidson. Perhaps my expectations were set too high. I order the fish tacos (tilapia) and they were mushy and bland. I also ordered a Chorizo quesadilla. I was ok, but not great. In all honesty, I've had more flavorful Mexican from local taco trucks and small family joints.  The location is favorable and I hope they do well. Maybe i came in on a bad night; I may give them one more chance."}
{"text":"My first visit was during lunch.  I really like the location-the Davidson area has been in  need of a good place to get Mexican food!  And I live less than a mile away, so this could turn out to be not good in some ways :)

The staff was very nice in explaining the menu, their specials and the many varieties of salsa they carry. I had tacos, and they were very large.  The only drawback was the price, my lunch was $15 for 3 tacos, a beverage and chips/salsa. 

I'll definitely be back to explore more of the menu!"}
{"text":"After Doug, the owner, messaged me on Yelp with some more adventurous suggestions, I grouped some co-workers together and headed back to Carrburritos. This time around, PERFECTION. I had the Tostada salad with the special chicken of the day (\"Pollo a la Mexicana\" - a perfectly seasoned chicken with fajitas), no cheese, no beans, but YES on sour cream. It was an AWESOME sized portion, and I cleaned my plate. Not too salty (like Chipotle can be!) and fantastic presentation. I'm definitely going for Tostadas from now on. Sometimes tostadas come in huge fried bowls, which lets be honest, are fun, but take away from the fact that you're trying to \"watch it\" and be health conscious. This salad had a tostada on the bottom of it that soaked up all of the salsa and was delicious, but not killer on the carbs.

Doug, thank you for the recommendations! I will absolutely be back for more. Next time, after work hours for a margarita!"}
{"text":"YUM!! Go to taco spot for the whole lake
Norman area. So yummy and fresh and the prices are crazy reasonable. In addition their salsa menu is extensive with many options and the verde salsa in particular is to die for!! Their chips are homemade and fresh as can be. Definitely check out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"This place is more like a Chipotle but better. They use very fresh ingredients and it is locally owned, not a chain. The food tastes great and there are several options to customize your taco, burrito, etc just like what you see at Chipotle. This restaurant is great for people that are in all sorts of diets, you are sure to find what you need to eat right here! The service is very nice, friendly and the price is competitive."}
{"text":"Delish! The younger gentleman with blonde hair that prepared my food was so nice! Great recommendation! Chicken quesadilla with corn pico! Yum and now I have dinner too! Thanks buddy! Your help is what will bring me back!"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food, nothing super special. But it's fresh and the best Mexican food we've found in the Charlotte area. However, my husband and I are not fans of queso, but they're chipsand queso are AMAZING. I actually didn't eat all of my taco because I just couldn't stop eating the queso! We will definitely be back for that again."}
{"text":"Went to Carrburrito today for lunch. This  was my second visit. After the first visit, a friend of mine and I thought we would give it another shot. 

Here are my observations:  

1). The menu is very confusing for both the guests and employees. The ordering process takes longer than it should and it appears the employees are not sure what to do. After saying my order 3 times it was wrong when I got my meal. 

2). The cards you out in your table are to small for the employees to read. Our delivery guy came by 3 times asking if someone else's food was ours. When having a business conversation the interruptions are annoying. He couldn't see the small number cards. 

3). Why are all the hot sauces behind the cash register?  I like to see whats on my burrito and I can't see them behind the register. It slows down the guy who is most important to a business, The guy who takes the money. 

Overall the food is better than the average burrito joint. Just wading  through all the inefficiencies makes it a difficult place to dine. 

I hope they make it. Lunch line was much shorter this time than my first visit."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. We had a small mishap with being given an additional ingredient we didn't ask for in one of our meals but the manager handled it very nicely. We really appreciated his professionalism. Skip the Chipotle for once and try out this local place in Davidson!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to grab quality food quick. I'm a huge fan of the Baja Shrimp Tacos and my kids enjoy the quesadillas. I love that everything looks, smells, and tastes fresh. The atmosphere is casual and intimate. There is a good amount of seating with a small bar with stools in the back. This is great place for couples, families, friends...everyone. In addition to the indoor dining room they offer outdoor seating. The menu is simple: tacos, burritos, nachos, salads, and quesadillas. Don't forget to check out their margarita specials!"}
{"text":"Fresh, homemade chips with lots of delicious sauces to choose from. The tacos were great too, I got shrimp ones and chicken ones. I love the quality of the ingredients and the fact this restaurant is nestled right in Davidson. You'll love the freshness of the ingredients."}
{"text":"Baja Tacos were out of control good! Paul and Jasmine did a great job taking care of us in a rushed situation. Great ambiance and awesome food!! Will be back. Thanks Jasmine and Paul!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh fresh food & amazing outside patio. Fresh margaritas and they are available in pitchers.. within walking distance of some great places."}
{"text":"Oh my, the burritos are excellent, so that's where we'll start. My family was passing through on a road trip and stopped at a Mexican restaurant in the middle of North Carolina. Man, were we pleasantly surprised by the quality here. Everything is made to order, and you can taste the quality. The nachos were also outstanding...get the barbecue beef. They also have what feels like an endless variety of salsas that are pretty good too. And yes, the margaritas are affordable and we'll done.

The prices are very affordable, which makes sense given the location in a college town. Stop in, get full, and be happy."}
{"text":"Love coming here!!! Great food and drinks!! Guacamole is yummy...and love the variety of chips!! Oh and great margaritas!!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice now and love it! I think they had some \"growing pains\" when they first opened, maybe some people ate there that didn't get the speediest/best service, but give them another chance. The food is really good and the homemade salsa are excellent. DON'T get the habanero though, unless you are a true fan of HOT! It's really, really, really intense. 
I'll be going there again for sure."}
{"text":"I loved it. You order at the counter and get your food in minutes. The 1 problem was the stranger in front of me had her order on my ticket. No biggee..they fixed it. Food is such a good price too, and you get to try their salsas free..awesome place."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat! Delicious!! Everything is fresh - outside seating is cozy and relaxing!"}
{"text":"Baja shrimp taco is my favorite.  I have had the nachos with chorizo, which come layered to perfection and piled high with topping yumminess.  I love their selection of salsas and make sure I get the frutas salsa almost every time.  The basket of chips has a mix of flour and corn tortillas to dip into your salsa.

Quesadillas are good.  I was surprised to get the sweet potato mash in it one time and thought it was surprisingly great and messy.  The bowls are a good option too.  I haven't had anything I didn't like but I constantly go back to the baja shrimp tacos and the nachos but mix it up with different toppings each time.  

Cheese dip is good.  Margaritas are better.  They have a crazy selection of margaritas, a must if you go.  They have good beer selection too.  

They have great outdoor patio seating & a decent amount of seating inside.  You walk in and order at the counter, pay and then grab a seat at the bar and order that yummy margarita (maybe blueberry?) or enjoy the weather outdoors.  Great location on South Main in Davidson.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm amending my review based on new info, the great service we received, and the general vibe of the place (including that awesome decor).

I recently learned that the \"other\" chips we received were made of flour. Not my cup of tea but my daughter liked them.

And because she's the real burrito head in the family, it's highly likely that she will return with friends.

Maybe I will too. 

Not 100% certain but... they DO have other menu items.  :-)"}
{"text":"It's a knock off of Moe's, or Chipotle, but not as good, overpriced, slow service, and confusing ordering process.  
1. I walked in thinking it was sit down order off the menu Mexican restaurant, but its not. So I order a pork burrito and watch the server start making it. 
I'm confused because he doesn't ask me what I want in it, but hands me a ticket. 
Now what?..

Directions below:
2. Take ticket to cashier and get your salsa offering. All choices are behind the counter so pick one. (tomatillo is bland!) 
3. Cashier now gives you a tablespoon of the salsa you choose in a tiny bowl, and puts it on a large plastic cafeteria tray. 
4. Pay cashier, but no burrito yet? Where did it go? 
5. Take large plastic tray with tablespoon of salsa and silverware to table and wait 10-15 mins for food. Be careful walking to table, floor is sticky.
6. Burrito and 10 tortilla chips arrive! Yea!! 
7. Enjoy 15 minute old, mushy, over priced burrito and enough salsa for half your chips.
8. Clean off your table, go home and wonder what just happened!"}
{"text":"after chasing down some home decor items my lovely bride and I needed to get some supper. We were coming up through Davidson and saw the sign and decided to have a go at it. Who says advertising doesn't pay?
Neither of us had been in before so the guys behind the counter walked us through nice and easy like. Wound up with carne deshebrada nachos and pollo asado burrito mejor to split plus a house margarita, XX, and waters.
Didn't take long for the food to find us and it looked good enough to eat, drinks followed shortly and everyone posed for the group picture.
Burrito was good sized and chock full of all that stuff on the menu, seems I got most of the guac in my half but we made it work; marinated chicken set well with black beans, lettuces, cheese and salsa and rice. Nacho plate was all beans-n-salsa-ed up and covered with of beef shreds and topped with a scoop of sour cream; crispy chips covered with sufficient goodness for every last bite.
Digging the water tap thing next to the soda thing, so many trips I should have got a bucket. Not a big fan of the marg', nothing really wrong but still..."}
{"text":"There's a Carrburritos in Davidson? I thought it's only in Carrboro! Regardless, since the last time I ate at Carrburritos in Carrboro was about 8 years back, I had no recollection of the food itself although I remember I used to love it. So we went here today for lunch. Now I remember why it's so awesome. 
Firstly, the chips are priced extra, but go ahead and get them anyway. The salsas are delicious! We tried the Salsa De Arbol (level 3) and Salsa Habanero (level 5). The De Arbol is much much better wrt to flavor. It's still spicy, but has a very nicely melded garlic and pepper flavor to it. The Habanero is just spicy so I didn't care much for it. My husband got the chicken quesadilla and I got the Baja shrimp tacos. Both our orders were super delicious. 
Service is friendly and prompt. The interior is clean and lively, and there's plenty of parking available in the back of the building. 
Needless to say we will be frequenting this place a lot at work lunches. Hands down five stars."}
{"text":"Great food. Love the burritos. We come here after church or the occasional nite out. Can't wait until another chance to go."}
{"text":"This afternoon we took our first trip to Davidson from Charlotte to spend the afternoon.  After reading a few reviews on places to lunch we settled on Carrburritos and we were so glad we did.  I cannot remember the last time we had Mexican so flavorful and fresh.  I had nachos with grilled chicken and my husband and daughter both had a burrito.  We also had the guacamole which was great and the chips fresh and crispy.  We all gave our meals .  We were extremely satisfied.  The staff was also very pleasant.  Don't hesitate to check out Carrburritos!  Great vibe, friendly staff & delicious food!"}
{"text":"Once again I find myself staring at an empty plate wondering what happened... Oh so delicious, except this time it was the pork belly tacos instead of the shrimp... make sure to get a take home jar of the homemade Chipotle salsa."}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised! The place is located in beautiful Davidson. You can sit inside their large dining area or outside if the weather permits. The place was packed but the line went pretty quickly. We ordered the shrimp tacos and Ceviche which were both amazing! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome idea, Davidson has been in need of Mexican/a burrito place. But not that well executed. A long wait for not that many patrons. Food is just ok and a little pricier than chipotle. 3.5 stars on the food and 2.5 stars on the service/system. I'll be back in a couple months once they've had time to work out the kinks."}
{"text":"I had an excellent meal at Carrburritos tonight. I stopped by several weeks ago and did not realize until I got inside that it was the grand opening. My impression of the place that night was not the best, but I also knew that opening night is always a tough one in the restaurant business. People are nervous, things are still being figured out, etc. So I knew I had to come back a few weeks later to get a better idea of how things are.

I'm very happy to say that Carrburritos will be a place I return to and recommend to friends. I am generally not a huge fan of quick service Mexican restaurants for the following reasons:

1) Same old boring menus.
2) Food is bland.
3) Food is not kept at proper temepratures, resulting in food that is not only bland but lukewarm,
4) Iceberg lettuce everywhere.

Fortunately, these issues do NOT exist at Carrburritos, if my meal tonight is any indication. The only exception is that I saw some \"Mexican Rice' that looked bland and lukewarm. Aside from that, everything looked fresh and tasty.

I ordered two crispy corn shell tacos- one filled with roasted veggies, the other filled with chorizo sausage. I also ordered chips and a side of queso sauce, which is a new item on the menu. At the suggestion of the line cook, I got sour cream on the chorizo taco and cheese on the roasted veggie taco. Or it may have been the other way around. I was too busy devouring them to remember! :) Both of the tacos were outstanding. The chorizo was delicious and very spicy. The roasted veggies were bursting with flavor, very fresh and vibrant. There are a variety of other choices of fillings, which can be ordered for any of the other items- burritos, quesadillas, etc. 

The chips were fresh, crispy and very tasty, and the queso dip was so good that I unabashedly ate it all with a fork after my dipping was done. I would have poured some onto the tacos but again, I was too busy devouring them to have thought about that. Next time!

Oh, and the tacos were served with plenty of lettuce and tomatoes- it almost looked like I was getting a salad when they served them to me- and guess what?  NO ICEBERG LETTUCE! YEEE HAA!!

I also chose the spicy Habanero salsa to go with my tacos, but I really didn't need it, since the tacos already had plenty of flavors and textures.But the salsa ws good. It was VERY good.

So to go back to my list of things I dislike about quick service Mexican restaurants, let me say that the food here is very fresh, the flavors pop, the menu is creative, and the absence of the iceberg lettuce warmed my heart.

They also have a full bar here. I'm not a drinker, but if you are, I think you'll be quite satisfied. 

Carrburritos is a welcome addition to Davidson and if they maintain the quality of food and service that I experienced tonight, they will be around for a good long time. Welcome, Carrburritos!"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and delicious. The hand-crafted margaritas are wonderful and are a special on Mondays. The only negative take away is that they often seem a little grouchy at the counter taking your order, but everyone else is always pleasant. Will keep going back for sure!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews that were listed below, with anything less than four stars, I can only hope that those who have not yet visited, are not turned away from Carrburritos.  My boyfriend and I have been into Carrburritos quite a few times since opening week.  Of course the flow of the place has only gotten better as each week open passes.  I think this is exactly what Davidson needed!  The environment is fabulous, the staff is friendly, and the bar is a fun relaxed setting.  On our first visit- we tried the burrito.  I would like to admit that the burrito is our least favorite thing on the menu.  The nachos are amazing; the salsa, chicken, chorizo, and veggies are all extremely fresh and delish!!  The method of ordering is still a bit confusing, but when you are there without a rush, and want to enjoy some fresh food!  We will obviously be back!"}
{"text":"Been waiting a while for some mexican food to pop up in Davidson and its finally here!

The ambiance is nice and very inviting, they have a margarita bar and a sitting area for non-eaters (ie: drinkers). I got my food to go, but next time, will try to eat there if I can.

I think they are still working out some kinks as it took longer than expected to get my food. The food was good (got a Carnitas burrito), the chips homemade, and the salsas fresh. The price is comparable to Chipotle, maybe a little bit more expensive, but I feel that you get more \"bang for you buck\" at Chipotle with regards to portion size.

Will definitely make a return trip to try other food there and I imagine by then the line will move faster and the food will be prepared quicker!"}
{"text":"I got to try out Carrburritos earlier this week, and am still thinking about the yummy burrito I enjoyed that night. It's a casual dining spot, with fabulous Mexican food. You order your food when you walk in, and they bring it to your table. 

I had the burrito mejor with carne deshebrada - a heaping serving of shredded beef marinated in all kinds of goodness, black beans, rice, guacamole, cheese, sour cream and lettuce and tomato. I added some of their delicious chipolte salsa for an extra kick. The burrito was served with a mix of corn and flour tortilla chips (loved the flour chips, something new and different). I was thrilled to imbibe in the house margarita (a $4 special) - Jeff the bartender served mine up specially in a martini glass since I wanted it straight up instead of on the rocks. The decor is fun and funky, and there's outside seating as well. 

I will be heading back to Carrburritos for an enjoyable, tasty, reasonably priced Mexican feast on my next visit to Davidson."}
{"text":"Great food at a very good price , went there before we went to see incredibles 2 . Service was excellent the guys in the front broke the menu down for us so it was really easy to make a food choice . Definitely will be going back again !"}
{"text":"We recently moved to Davidson. Our daughter in law told us this was a great place to eat from her experience with one in another city. We weren't disappointed. We split a burrito since it was huge with chips and salsa! Very good. Service a little slow and they weren't busy. However, worth the wait. We will go back!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and the order taker only got half of the order right after it was repeated. I find the food here to be plain and bland. Nothing special. Chipotle is better then this place."}
{"text":"We enjoyed it. We went for a party but have heard so many great thing about this place. I will not say it was the best I ever had but we thought it to be super tasty. Love the water infused with fruit.  I had a burrito and a iced tea."}
{"text":"I like it. Much better than Chipotle. Would definitely go back. The salsas are tasty and the atmosphere is very casual."}
{"text":"Fantastic Fresh Salsas, I Love them all especially the Pineapple one!
Customer Service is Fantastic! Love the cool Atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I have had in Charlotte.  I was visiting a friend in the Davidson area who recommended Carrburritos for lunch. I immediately said yes as I had seen the reviews on Yelp and been wanting to check it out.

The location is a little hidden, but I guess if you live in the area you might not think so. After arriving I browsed the menu and decided to go with the Chicken Quesadilla and my friend chose the fish tacos, he said they were his favorite. We moved on to the cashier at which point you order chips, regular or crispy, salsa, red or green and drinks.  Having never been I didn't know the difference in the chips or salsa so we opted to order 1/2 and 1/2 and both the red and green salsas, with two margaritas of course. We received a number and grabbed a table.
Shortly after we sat down, our margaritas were delivered, which I enjoyed very much.  As for the chips, I preferred the original, more traditional chip to the maybe deep fried one.  Just not my thing. And, I also preferred the red salsa over the green. Although not HOT, they did have more of a spice/kick, which I prefer.
As for the food, the portions were huge. My quesadilla was filled with a generous amount of chicken and cheese and was grilled to perfection. The quesadillas came with a side of sour cream and pico, which I loved. Could have used a little more pico.  My friend loved the fish tacos, even so much that I didn't even get to try them... 

Overall if you are in the Davidson area, looking for some good Mexican food, great staff and comfortable atmosphere, definitely be sure to check out Carrburritos!"}
{"text":"This place is better than traditional sit down Mexican at half the price. The nachos are huge and loaded with whatever fillings you ask for. I love when nachos have more filling than chips so you don't have any plain chips left at the end. Carrburritos definitely doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Baja shrimp tacos, ceviche and the nachos!!! Margaritas are great too. Fun cute and fun atmosphere, I always go here."}
{"text":"Boodle and I hit up Carburritos on a Friday night and it was crowded! Luckily we got a table. Carburritos is delicious; the menu is basic but offered a lot of options and you order in line and make your specifications there. I had a burrito with shredded beef; it was very flavorful and huge. I love that this place offered free salsas with a lot of variety. They also have craft beer.

This place is great for groups. I totally missed all the available parking behind Carburritos and behind the location next door. There is also limited street parking if all the other parking is full."}
{"text":"Quick service, trendy place and pretty good food. My fiancé ordered steak tacos and I ordered a burrito. My fiancé thought the tacos were the best he'd ever had, my burrito was mediocre. Very good salsa and queso dip, chips were ok. Margaritas were a little pricey but delicious. Plan on coming back on a warmer day to enjoy patio seating. I'd give it 3 stars but my fiancé said 5 so I'm giving it a 4.

We came back again and I ordered something different. Upgrading my review from 4 to 5 stars. The service was outstanding."}
{"text":"This place was a fun hidden gem, in town visiting I didn't know what to expect. 
Pretty good food, although not a fan of them charging extra for things that every burrito place just gives you for free...."}
{"text":"I went there again, and it didn't seem so loud this time.  Good, big burrito, and the chips were good too."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.   Fresh food.  If there during the summer, check in on any watermelon margaritas.  Kim knows how to make some great specialty margaritas.   They aren't afraid of the spice of you crave it (ceviche, chorizo, salsas....).  Yum!"}
{"text":"Portion size is great with every taco and burrito we tried absolutely stuffed with meat.  Service is friendly and you order at the counter, take a number, go sit and your meal comes out quickly.  One tip, pay attention to the list of salsa's so you're prepared when you get to the register and they ask.  We were not and just blurted something out after a quick glance.

My issue is that while the portions were huge, the flavor was lacking and each meat we tried was frankly pretty bland.  Maybe I was spoiled by eating at the red taco truck that shows up on Statesville road the week before.  Now THAT joint has flavors! 

There is a full bar but it was a little early for a cocktail this day.  A friend says they serve a good Margarita though."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time after seeing a picture on Facebook of their award winning marguerita.....well worth the trip!
Food was fresh and delicious....even my picky kids cleared their plates.   I had the Baja shrimp tacos which were outstanding, hubby had shredded beef taco which he loved and the peanuts...one had a chicken quesadilla and the other chicken tacos .... As I said before, both cleaned their plates.
Of course the reason I went there was the watermelon basil marguerita....omg sooooo good and I can't wait to go back to get another!!!"}
