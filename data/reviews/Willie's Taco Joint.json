{"text":"Food was excellent! I would suggest  a medium soft drink instead of a small cup. If there was a bigger cup size it wasn't offered. Also need a hook in the ladies room to hang your purse. Love the look of the place and it's open patio, very clean and good music. It also has a nice open bar. Staff was friendly! Definitely will return."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Phoenix, and to be totally honest, I made it a point to keep my expectations in check upon my arrival. To put it lightly, this city has impressed. 

Willies played in integral role in my wonderful experience during my short stay. The service was nothing short of phenomenal. Cecilia walked me through the menu and was both patient and delightful. The choices are many here. The margarita I ordered was fantastic, and the food was even better. Pro tip: (lol) The braised beef tacos are an absolute delicacy. The food came out very quickly, the vibe was nice and relaxed, and the location was perfect. 

Even management came by and checked on us twice which did not go unnoticed. Willies is clearly making an effort at every level and you would do yourself a grave disservice to drop through Phoenix without stopping by this place. As if she didn't already do enough, Cecilia even gave us nightlife and entertainment recommendations that turned out to be an absolute blast! Just trust me on this one folks, stop by Willies; you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My burrito bowl was about 90% plain lettuce. Once I ate the small bit of toppings, the rest wasn't worth eating. Everyone else seemed to like their tacos and burritos so just stay away from the bowl option."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great Price.  Porkbelly tacos were the best.  Check this place out if you are at the convention center."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday 3/3/17 for food before suns game. Literally sad joke. About 30 people inside with 3 workers and 1 cook. Allegedly the computer went down which wasn't sending receipts to cook. Ordered a bowl and sadly it was a bowl of iceberg lettuce and nothing else. My friends had complications with their orders. Hence the other review. It was a mess. Chicken with no head"}
{"text":"Visiting for a convention and saw this on yelp- the green taco is indeed worth the visit with a decent quantity of perfectly prepared pork. The other dishes are also quite good- I tried the black bean and my colleague the pollo taco salad"}
{"text":"One carnitas taco was $4.00. It was good, but the meat itself was not seasoned. You are expected to season with salsas and toppings. However, I had a problem when attempting to pay for it in cash which came to $4.34 after tax. I was told, \"We only have quarters.\" I asked her to clarify how they give change. \"We round up to the nearest quarter.\" 
This is nonsense. We are not yet a cashless society. If a business is not going to keep coin on-hand, then prices should be in the European style. The stated price includes tax and should be a whole dollar amount."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The murals on the walls are fun and really entertaining.  The large outdoor patio is a perfect spot to enjoy the rolled tacos and a couple margaritas before the next Suns game.  A new 'must stop location' in d-town Phoenix."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! Great service, friendly fast passed atmosphere. Came for lunch with my hubby. Will be back to try the burritos and a house margarita as I hear they are amazing!"}
{"text":"Tacos were good, a little overpriced for what we got. Me and my fianc√© ended up with food poisoning from it though."}
{"text":"The tacos are good. the service is shit. They need to get with the program before the season starts."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre. We ordered the carne asada tacos with rice and beans and carne asada fries. The tacos were okay and the rice and beans were just gross. The rice has peas in it, if that tells you anything and it was dried out. The beans were covered in cheese, like I really was going to ask them if I could have beans with my cheese. The carne asada fries were actually good and the best thing we ordered and the house Margarita was pretty good. 

This place doesn't have servers so you have to go to the counter to order your food and then they bring your food to your table. I wouldn't come here again, because I can go to a taco truck for better quality food and cheaper. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Great food and a fun and neighborhood friendly environment.  

Also the taco salad that I just learned is on the menu is great."}
{"text":"A great place for simple yet delicious food.  It was a chilly night when we arrived - the owner went over and above to bring us heaters and make our table comfortable. Will definitely return when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"I ordered a bean burrito and asked for sauce on the inside. They served it to me with sauce on the outside. I understand that is how they normally offer it on the menu, but I still sent it back because I specifically requested it inside the burrito so I could still eat it with my hands. When they brought out my new order, it was just a a bean burrito that couldn't stay together. After two bites the burrito busted open. To top it off, I did not taste any sauce in it, so I paid $2 extra for this sauce I did not even get. Disappointed. Do not make any special requests here. Otherwise, they seem ok."}
{"text":"Tacos are delicious and margaritas are great! It's a packed spot, so don't expect to be able to find a seat inside. However, the food is more than worth it."}
{"text":"Willies has some beautiful Urban art all over it's walls. I love that they used a local talent. I will be darkening their door for their yummy tacos & cocktails at all of my trips to the Dbacks park this summer. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"This taco shop is at the bottom of my list.  This is my first time though based on what I experienced, I dont think I will be back.  If you like bland or nonspicey food then this may be the place for you.  The place is very clean and the service was on top of their game.  I went around 12pm and there was almost no one there, so it is not busy at all. 

Mexican Red Specialty taco- the shrimp were small and mushy.  I am not even sure if they were cooked all the way.  They had a slight sweet flavor to them but that is it.  I found the red tortilla entertaining though there was not enough Jimica slaw and it was very little value for $4.50. 

Baja Fish Specialty taco- tons of slaw, very small piece of fried fish, no flavor at all.  I added thier jalapeno avocado sauce which didnt have any flavor either. Very disapointing and very little value for $4.50.

Fresh made chips- now I love fresh made chips.   These were think though salted well.  A little too greasy for my liking though.

Guacamole- this didnt taste bad, just needed more flavor like salt and lime/lemon juice."}
{"text":"Have been walking past this place soo many times when walking to Chase Field. Finally decided to go in the other day which I don't regret. The food and drinks were awesome! I would recommend their taco salad, it was sooo delicious. Also their mango habanero, super good! Will definitely come back next time it's Baseball time!"}
{"text":"Went there before the PINK concert.  It's counter service only. Nice staff & the chicken nachos were excellent and enough for more than one person!  Chips, salsa & guac were really good!  The chips were thicker than normal but delicious. It was a great reasonable priced place to catch a quick bite before an event."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are amazing to start off! Perfect crisp on the chips and salsa you can shovel in your mouth. They have unique tacos and the burritos are delicious. I had the carne asada burrito with beans and rice and it was so good that I ate half and saved half for later!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome Taco Shop. The cooks definately know what they are doing The Carne Asada Taco is a must have and make sure to try the fresh cut fries. Cecilia is an amazing person who always goes above and beyond to make each visit an amazing experience. This is a 5 plus place"}
{"text":"Great California Burrito! Great ambient and service good. I recommend as a great option. Oss"}
{"text":"We normally grab a bite to eat before the game and thought we'd give Willie's a try. 
First and last time. We spent $30 plus tip on 2 beers and 2 greasy, tasteless taco plates. The tacos were greasy and you couldn't tell what kind of meat it was. Refried beans looked like they were dumped out of a can. The rice was bland. 
Not only was the food bad, their was a table of loud, drunk guys behind us.  The place is small, so not a lot of others areas to go to. 3 days later and I'm still disappointed on the time and money wasted there. With so many other spots to hit in the area, we won't be back. Nasty."}
{"text":"The Green Butcher taco with beans..... not bad. I would have like more green chili flavor but it was tender so points for that and I did like the Green tortillas that was a nice touch visually. Flavor is almost there but good for a late nite snack especially after a baseball game"}
{"text":"Food was just okay, nothing special. Prices are doable and the atmosphere was nice. The meat or fish in the tacos just lacked some seasoning. Other than that the food was good. I ordered the enchiladas with two fried eggs, and I would order it again."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to check out this new taco spot and I'm glad we did! Beautiful Sunday afternoon, 65degree weather, patio seating and a good Mexican beer made for a pretty awesome day. I literally could spend all day there, perfect location by Chase field and a good people watching spot. 

Our server was attentive but not overbearing. A great spot that wasn't too crowded and could still get a table on the patio. Food was pretty good too, check out the pictures of the menu. I had two pollo tacos with a flour tortilla and you can choose between Mexican or American style. The tacos were $4/each and then beans and rice were additional $2, not bad. I could see this place being a go-to for a few beers and chips/salsa."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to stop in at Willie's Taco Joint in downtown Phoenix but every time I would be in the area, there would be a game that day so this joint was always crowded. This past weekend, I rode the light rail for an event and got off right by this taco place. Downtown was quiet since no games were scheduled so decided to stop in. I didn't have a taco but decided to order French Fries and an iced tea. April was great as a bartender. Fries were tasty. I will definitely have to stop in and try a taco or entree here. Cheers***"}
{"text":"We stopped in today to check out the latest addition to the downtown neighborhood. 

Pro: super friendly server and cook, freshly made tacos (worth a little extra wait for fresh) and great space to enjoy once it gets a little warmer

Con: the tacos were quite messy and somewhat greasy & the agave shrimp smelled fishy...yuck!

We ordered 5 tacos to do (in order of best to worst): chicken gringo taco, beef gringo taco, carne asada, pork carnitas, & agave shrimp.  I will definitely give this place another chance, but not rushing back quite yet."}
{"text":"Really great spot with amazing art all around you. Best advice - sit at the bar, great service. The open air setup really reminds me of sitting in a cantina in Mexico. Absolutely awesome place to spend an afternoon watching football. Decent tequila selection, good micheladas and good food from the kitchen."}
{"text":"This place was pleasant. I enjoyed trying the Green Butcher taco. Delicious. On my next stop I wanna try the Pork Belly Taco I hear it's good. The only bad thing about my first trip here was they didn't have Wild Tonic Tropical Tumeric on tap. And the bottles cost $12 each. That's why I'm only giving 4 stars. Lol"}
{"text":"Price is right and the food is great. I'm a fan of the carnitas. Owner/chef is super friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fun place to go after a Diamondbacks game. Lot's of people around, good food and drink."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and both times I was not disappointed. There are not really any taco places within walking distance of the court buildings downtown. I was so happy to see this place open. The rolled tacos are a favorite of mine. Nice and crunch and come with a healthy dollop of guacamole. I've also had the chile braised beef which is really tasty. Do not leave without trying the mango salsa. Sweet and spicy, you will want to put it on everything."}
{"text":"Just visiting Phoenix for the weekend for a convention. This place is new, amazing and delicious. Not to mention fresh and healthy!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to grab an early lunch after spending the morning at the Phoenix Flea Market. The selection of tacos was promising- seemingly with options to meet my dietary restrictions- as well as a wide assortment of specialty choices. If there were any other patrons there when we walked in, there weren't many- as I said , it was a bit early for lunch. I ordered their veggie option, specifically I indicating NO cheese, with their rice and beans. When my tacos arrived- they seemed to be in order. The beans, however, were covered in cheese (and therefore inedible for me). After biting into my second taco, I noticed that my no cheese requirement was also ignored as it contained quest fresco- and the rest of my meal was then also inedible. (And having now unknowingly eaten dairy I'm sick.) 
The rest of my party did enjoy their tacos, the variety of salsas, and the nice day we spent on their patio. The service was minimal, as the casual nature of the place lends itself to that. It did seem to take quite a bit of time for our food to arrive- especially considering the fact they weren't busy at all.  There was an availability issue with the drinks we ordered- and the staff went to check to see if there were other options in the back. I had to remind them when our food was delivered that we had not yet received our drinks- which is when we were notified that our choices weren't available. Alternatives weren't immediately suggested. 
All in all, for tacos it was decent. Service for me can really break a place, even if the food is good. I am very aware that my food restrictions are my problem- which is why I'm always adamant to inform my server. To have those instructions completely ignored is frustrating. I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon, which is a shame because I love tacos."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the tacos. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos, and I must say they were pretty good. The tortillas were cooked to give a perfect crunch and I was pleased to see the cilantro and onion weren't mixed together because I love cilantro, but haaaaaaaate onions. Haha the meat in my opinion had room for better flavor, but none the less still very good. I would say it's worth your time to check them out."}
{"text":"Great fun place to stop at before the game!!! Delicious tacos, great bar selection. Not much seating though so grab your spots fast!"}
{"text":"Meh. Service was average and so was the food. I wouldn't recommended going out of your way to eat here. However, if you're within a couple blocks and want a beer with bar food then grab a seat."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding, my margarita was very good, and the vibe was perfectly relaxed and chill.  Service was also very good and the employees friendly.  To top all that off, the prices are beyond reasonable.  Wish my stay in Phoenix was longer so I could try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"The tacos were phenomenal and the service was attentive and very friendly, despite the fact that they were hosting a private party while I was in there. I had a chance to meet the owner, who really took pride in his employees and all of those who helped open the restaurant. The atmosphere is awesome, I can't wait to come back when I go to a Diamondbacks game! 

-Love from LA, Lisa Jean"}
{"text":"Just moved into the area, was looking for a place that was open at 11pm (there was a suns game) and ended up here. After eating four tacos four different ways l, I know I'll be back! They all had tons of flavor and the hot red salsa added even more."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant,  although it is hardly that. It's a few tables and a bar, but adorable. You order at the counter and find a seat. The waitress was kind and friendly,  making suggestions that worked out great. I had Nachos with chicken and for $10.50, I thought it was expensive...that is until the order came. My friend and I shared it and couldn't finish it all! If you like heat, add the mango/habenero (spelling? Ugh) sauce, if not, use the jalapeno avacado sauce. I used both! If you really feel bold, pair it with a habenaro margarita! Conveniently located, literally steps from the light rail, a must stop for your Phoenix day out. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The tacos are good, margaritas are strong.  Prices are reasonable.  Nice patio.  I liked the Baja taco a lot, two should fill you up."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND

I first heard about Willie's Taco Joint after attending the Arizona Ultimate Women's Expo a year ago. I was with my friend, Eva, and she wanted to try it.

WILLIE'S TACO JOINT, THE STORY, & SERVICE EXPERIENCE

Willie's Taco Joint, is the artsy, casual counterpart to the downtown Phoenix sports bar, Coach's Corner, co-owned by Eric Stoltz, in downtown Phoenix, Arizona.

Willie's Taco Joint is on the southeast corner of Jefferson and Third, across the street from the Phoenix Convention Center.

I absolutely love the Dia De Los Muertos/street art vibe of Willie's Taco Joint, painted by Lalo Cota. Cota, who specializes in spray-painting murals, explained the process that brought Willie's walls to life. Cota said he worked with them on ideas and came back with sketches. He spray painted the artwork based on those initial sketches. 

Willie's Taco Joint has a very very hip and fresh feeling, and there is a nice patio setup too.

It's a very casual do-it-yourself order at the counter situation, where they take your order and give you a number. Every time I've been, the same adorable server has been there: She's kind of a cashier/bartender/jack of all trades. I totally love her positive attitude. Stoltz said that he switched from a full service to self-serve to avoid some of the payroll costs after the changes in the Arizona minimum wage increases.

The one specialties of Willie's Taco Joint is their soft tacos, with their fresh tortillas. I love their Maui Wowie, which I get every time, and the last time I tried their pulled pork taco. I have to admit, the pork was hard to chew, unfortunately, which is disappointing because the flavor was very good.

Another specialty is their hot sauce bar. There are 6-8 choices at any given time. The last time, I tried the mango habanera and the avocado jalape√±o. YUMMY!

There is also a full bar and they have a bunch of flavored margaritas and mimosas too. I got the mango mimosas, which were very delicious and really hit the spot.

I think Willie's Taco Joint is very cute and fun, but there's not much air circulation and it can get a little hot and stuffy in parts. Also, if you look up, it's very dusty/dirty. Both of which give an authentic Mexico vibe, but it's not in Mexico, it's in the downtown of one of the biggest cities in the United States.

CONCLUSION 

Although this is not a place I would specifically drive downtown to eat at, Willies Taco Joint is solid place to grab some super fresh and creative tacos with great flavors. The drinks are great too. The service is fantastic.

I will definitely be back.

4/5 RECOMMEND

{"text":"Stopped in before the game today. 
Got my food quick and it was Tasty. 
The bartender Derek was very nice."}
{"text":"Willies taco joint was a big letdown. I found it to be not a clean establishment and miss Willie should focus on cooking school instead of CUSTOMER SERVICE and I think we all know what I mean...it's not family oriented"}
{"text":"I HIGHLY recommend this place before and/or after an Arizona Diamondbacks game (obviously not during, because duh, you should go to the game itself, as Willie's is right next door to Chase Field)! 

The food is reasonably priced (get the Carne Asada burrito, as you can never go wrong with Carne Asada)! The flavor is phenomenal! And the cost is beyond worth it! Also you can pick from like 900 different salsas to add to your burrito. So every time you visit you can get a classic favorite, while also trying something new!

Like most places in Downtown Phoenix, drinks are over priced, but not as much as Chase Field! 

However, the selling point is the service paired with the crowd size!!! The service is fantastic! You can get your drinks, right as you order; and food within a few minutes! The servers are friendly! And the atmosphere that both create is AWESOME! 

Also, the crowds are not stupid busy, so it makes for an enjoyable and relaxed atmosphere, but extremely fun environment!

I've only been here a couple times but plan on coming back many many more times; as should you!"}
{"text":"Came after the bridal expo and ideally came for just drinks with the option to eat. I asked 3 questions on the drink menu and the bartender did not know any answers. I ended up ordering just a champagne and it was served in a small plastic cup. This place is subpar. It looks inviting and fun with the decor...the type of place that would be known for their margaritas and yet honestly no pictures on the menu or anything to invite me to want to order a margarita."}
{"text":"Perfect place to grab food before the baseball game, event at Talking Stick or if your at the Convention Center.  The Green Butcher is my favorite and I love the salsa bar and the fact that they are in individual cups so no ones hands are all over my salsa."}
{"text":"Upon entering you immediately notice the festive feeling resulting from the decor, the brightly colored antique wood planks on wall behind bar, and the spray paint artwork decorating main dining room and many other areas.  The rainbow of colors combined with the open layout and extensive patio create the feel of a real Mexican Fiesta!  Ordered one pork belly taco and one carne asada taco with a margarita.  I loved the tacos, especially the pork version, which included chunks of pineapple and a delicious sauce.  The margarita was delicious, the tacos were tasty, the service was very friendly, quick, and efficient...I can't wait to go back soon and often and eat my way thru the rest of their menu!  Willies Taco Joint is great new addition to  Downtown Phoenix and is definately worth a visit!"}
{"text":"My pals and I attempted to get some grub before a suns game at 630pm on a Friday. They were pretty busy and there was a line. There were 8 of us total and we all ordered food and drinks. 

The people sitting by us said there was an error with their computer and they had waited for over an hour to get their food.. it took our food about 25 minutes to come out and the manager did stop by and say he was sorry for the wait. 

I ordered a pollo taco and a carne asada taco on corn tortillas. The order was tied to a number so I assumed it would be pretty tough to mess up. When my tacos came, I received one chicken and one carnitas on flour tortillas. I took them back to the counter to explain the situation and the manager apologized and said he would fix it. I waited another ten minutes and was then handed two carne asada tacos.. starving at this point I just took my food to eat. They were out of 3/6 Salsas so I had to settle for pico de gallo. The carne asada tacos were OK but nothing to write home about. 

My bud had a burrito bowl with so little meat he took it back and asked for his money back as he said it was bland and not what he expected. 

I understand it was busy but to mess up my order twice and not offer any compensation I felt was pretty harsh. In addition, the lack of adequate staffing on game night when you are across the street from the arena makes no sense to me."}
{"text":"We chose to have lunch at this place because it looks like \"Coco\" (the movie) and kids and I absolutely love Mexican food, we get there and immediately go to the counter, no greeting, no one to explained how things run there, so we  were standing  just looking and the Big Menu on top of the bar, finally someone tells us they can bring menus to our table, but only after finishing their VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AMONG THEMSELVES; the Tacos were O.k. But the Carne asada definitely very hard to eat, my kids couldn't finished it, nachos were very good though. There are no limes in the salsa bar, and they give you a TINY little piece for your overpriced taco, staff was NOT friendly at all, and even though is a VERY cute place I don't think I will ever go back or recommend it to anyone, just head to a taco truck and you'll get better service, price and flavor than at this place"}
{"text":"We are from Cali and it's a good place for some quick drinks and tacos before the game. Salsa is bomb and we hope to see the Dodgers beat the d bags"}
{"text":"Greatest tacos in Phoenix!!  This place is friendly with great food and drinks!! Outdoor sitting but inside also has an outdoor feel. If you want a great taco then come to this place!!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a small, local taco/burrito place that tasted like a homemade meal with decent ingredients.  I didn't want a chain, or an upscale place or a cheap place  - I just wanted tasty food that seemed like it was made with real ingredients with price a secondary consideration.  The hotel I was staying at recommended this place and they were right on!  

I ordered a bean, cheese, rice burrito with avacados (I think it was an off menu item) with no beverages and it was right on. 

This is *not* the place for someone who wants a foodie experience or a nice sit down restaurant, but for me who likes small Mexican food places when I am on the road -- it was perfect.  I will be back the next time I am in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks and cool spot! Derek (sp) was the host/manager and he was absolutely awesome! Very kind and attentive!!"}
{"text":"Tacos are top notch.   The carne asada Mexican style are my favorite.  I eat here before every game or event."}
{"text":"Late night beer soaker upper place. Great service and nice art work/lighting. The place had some other drunk people mingling around. Sometimes you don't want to sit down and go through all that rigmarole when you can grab a taco and fill the void. This place serves that purpose."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for the new local taco joint. Unfortunately my hopes were shattered after ordering a couple of tacos. Very bland, near flavorless meats. Soft corn taco shells were drenched in oil that wasn't hot enough resulting in soggy oil dripping mess. Disgusting!  Salsas were equally devoid of flavor and substance.

Great ambience though. Good place to hang and have a drink at the bar or on the patio to people watch during a downtown event.

Annoying side note. Just got up from my table and ordered a couple of beers at the bar (they don't have table servers). Total was $10 and change, bar tender returned only $9 change. Now I don't care about a little bit of change but it is not the bartenders decision to make. It cost her a $3 tip."}
{"text":"This a great place!!! Went in for dinner after our conference at the convention center. Service was great, you order and then grab a seat. I ordered two tacos, the Pork Belly (which was very tasty) and the Green Butcher (okay but not as good as the Pork Belly Taco). The meat was tender and very full, I recommend getting 2 tacos. There is a salsa bar, not a lot of seating indoors, mostly outside on the street. Great for dinner, great food, nice decor and great service! Wholeheartedly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"havent been to the actual location yet but these guys served up the single best taco i had at last weeks Tacolandia festival, beating out like 20 other great places. can't wait to make my way to the actual restaurant"}
{"text":"Good location for the convention center and arenas.  Nice open air street food feel.  The tacos are good,  but the Carne Asada is tri-tip and excellent!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Pork belly tacos and the Green Butcher taco are my favorites- soo good! As are both the mango and avocado salsas. Great atmosphere with cool spray painted murals and an awesome outdoor patio, and the manager is the best!! Glad I found this place before it's official opening because it's going to get popular very quickly."}
{"text":"Food is Great! So is the Mango Habanero sauce. Everything tasted awesome.
We had the Mahi Mahi Fish Taco, Shrimp Guacamole Chips, and the Fatty Burrito
We will come back again when in the area by the Phoenix Convention Center or Chase Ballpark."}
{"text":"Really, really like this place!!! Considering the proximity to the stadiums, they are a great find for the money!!!! Offer happy hour 2-5pm and have specials on many drinks. $5 rum and diets for this girl pre-game. Also- I generally steer clear of salads at Mexican based restaurants. Do not take that route here. I highly recommend the taco salad with carne and the chili lime vinaigrette $8. It is absolutely delicious and very filling. Tacos sold ala carte for $3.50-$4.50 each. Also some delicious burrito and app options."}
{"text":"Mediocre food for high price tag. You're better off finding a real taco truck for literally half the price."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Had a few drinks here before Kings-Suns game. Micheladas are great, margaritas were ok. The wife had two tacos, I had a \"fatty\" burrito, both were excellent. A little surprising how empty the place was especially on a game day, but I couldn't complain. Overall, definitely would come back for a \"pre-game\" here any time, basketball or baseball. Location is great!"}
{"text":"Great place, relaxed mood, reasonable price for great food and the location is awesome."}
{"text":"Tasty tacos!! Salsa so good it makes you drool! My husband and I love this spot!! Can't wait to try more of the menu soon."}
{"text":"This place is only O.K....I've had quite a few different places around the valley and if you're looking for anything authentic this is not your place.  The burrito I had had so much cheese it was all that I could taste.  My wife got the nachos with chicken.  The chicken wasn't pulled it was chunks.  Even on the nachos it had 90% cheese and 10% other toppings.  Not worth the over priced food and drinks.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, loved the salsa, and the margaritas were delicious!!! Not to mention the artwork  and scenery is beautiful!!! Thank you for the wonderful service and fun time. I will definitely be back!! :)"}
{"text":"Really good place if you're in the mood for tacos. The salsa bar is awesome too and the guac has a nice kick to it."}
{"text":"I had the carnitas street tacos with chips and guacamole yesterday.  I am a huge fan of guacamole and theirs was really good! The carnitas tacos were average.  I would eat them again but they just didn't have that wow factor you crave for."}
{"text":"Tried the pork belly tacos.  Nice portion to enjoy lunch.  Easy to find on 3rd & Jefferson."}
{"text":"OMG!  When o die and if I make it to heaven, I am pretty sure I will end up here with this tacos and a beer!!  Got to try it!!  
The Green Butcher is awesome!  AND!!!  They have a salsa bar!"}
{"text":"The decor- artsy, Dio de los Muertos meets Phoenician- was enough to lure us in on a game day, because honestly, what is a better pre-game food than tacos?! Tucked in at a corner near a parking garage, across the street from the Convention Center, I was surprised it wasn't more busy, even for a weekday. We decided to give their specialty tacos a try and ordered a fish taco and pork belly taco. Shockingly, it was like tasting tacos from two different vendors! The fish taco was bland and had two much breading, and I simply couldn't eat it. But the pork belly was delicious! It had some heat and a tangy sauce that encased the tender pork belly- and it worked! They also had a homemade salsa bar and I personally liked the mango relish to compliment it, too. When the manager, Eric, came and asked how the food was, I was honest with him. He took the feedback very seriously and asked if we were open to trying another one of their specialties - the Green Butcher. I liked! If you enjoy green chili, this is probably your taco. I didn't love it as much as the pork belly, but it had a distinct flavor profile which was a notable improvement compared to the fish taco. I would be open to going back, especially because they have good drink specials for being downtown, and they are just starting out. They definitely have some recipes that deliver good tacos and the ambience offers a nice alternative to a sea of trendy, overpriced eateries in that area. We live in one of the best taco places in America, for tacos, it's a tough market to be in!"}
{"text":"A carne asade taco the Mexican way is perfect after a Diamondbacks game. This place is small and I'd imagine it can get crowded but it's a short walk from the ballpark and a must try for tacos after a game or anytime really. If I lived in Phoenix I'd be at this place all the time."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos. Cold beer. Friendly service. Outdoors with plenty of fans to keep cool."}
{"text":"White supremacists rejoice! Do you like racist music? Hate blacks and Mexicans, but like their foods? White willies got you. Its got a pro gun pro rape anti immigrant vibe and feel. Trump supporters will love this place. Grab a taco, listen to music about guns alcohol and rape, get drunk and enjoy the alt right eats."}
{"text":"I visited this place twice while I was in town and had about 9 of the items on the menu! You should definitely check out this taco joint. I didn't take pictures of every thing but definitely a place I will visit again."}
{"text":"Did three types of tacos, fish and shrimp. Tacos and salsa were ok. Not bad, have eaten better. The tortilla corn shells are delicious compared to flour."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch and our overall experience was just okay. The food was decent, but a little expensive for what it was. My wife's burrito seemed pretty good, but the guacomole and chips weren't anything to write home about. I had the \"award-winning\" green butcher taco - decent flavor profile, but the shredded pork hardly seemed seasoned to me. Overall, a disappointing meal for us.

We enjoyed the atmosphere and misting machines, but sometimes the wind blew mist on our meal. You order at the counter/bar and they bring your food to you; I had no issues with this, but some might. The bartenders were friendly.

Location wise, this is between Talking Stick Resort Arena and Chase Field as well as being across from the convention center. I'm sure they may get very busy due to this at times, but it wasn't too bad when we were there and it seems like conveniently-located. If you're in need of a quick drink/bite before a game and not too worried about cost, this might be good fit for you."}
{"text":"Tacoabout flavor! This cute little taco spot was just what I needed for workday lunch. I got four tacos, carne asada (2), green butcher and pork belly. The carne asade taco has warm corn tortilla with onions and cilantro (so yummy went back for a second). The pork belly has great balance of pineapples to go with the bbq sauce. The green butcher was eh (still devoured it) however the pork was a little dry. Wouldn't get it again. I added the rice and beans to the tacos but that was just unnecessary with that much food, plus they were pretty basic. The place has loads of sauces like verde, jalape√±o avocado, pico, salsa, allah dat! So if you're a greedy one like me it's perfect. V friendly staff and great seating. Really wanted to try the carne asada fries may have to come back for that. Overall would recommend"}
{"text":"Wow excellent lunch pricing. The meal was so delicious, service amazing. Centered right next to Chase field you can hop on light rail."}
{"text":"Great Experience on the way home from the teacher, \"Walk out Capitol\" events. They were slammed but handled it well. The food was good and the place has a good vibe. Great stop over for DBACKS game nights and other DT events."}
