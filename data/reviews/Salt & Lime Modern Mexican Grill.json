{"text":"Will never go back. 3rd time is the charm. Went in last night at 9:15. Bar mats where already on the bar. Lady behind the bar looked up and said \"Kitchens closed\" not hi. Not a smile. Nothing. I said that's ok. Can we still get a drink?  The woman frowned and looked at her watch!!!  This is the attitude I have seen the last 3 visits. The bartenders and wait staff just don't care."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  We had a party of 8 with two small kids, and though the place is small, there was enough noise so that the kids were not a distraction to the other patrons (not noisy in a bad way - just lots of conversation and normal bustle).  Casual place, friendly waitstaff.  The food was good, very fresh, not too heavy.  I don't like extremely spicy food and this was the right combination of flavor and spice for me."}
{"text":"Joe is Amazing!  The Sopapilla's were outstanding!!  Had a great time on the patio!!  Thank you for carrying my Hidden Crush wine.  Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Good ambiance , food is very trendy and not traditional mex by any stretch .  Service was good and friendly but after eating here twice I would rate the foods 1 service and friendliness a solid 4.  The reason I rate this a two is based only off good, not service"}
{"text":"If you're hankering for dessert... Don't pass up the churros. Super fresh. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has great tacos and dessert. However, they close their kitchen a half an hour before their hours state even for to go orders. The service we had when we dined in was mediocre."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great tacos, free chips and salsa, margaritas on tap.  The staff is always friendly.  Good tequila selection.  Perfect place too catch a game with a little bit of an island feel in the desert."}
{"text":"Not bad, marginal service. Never refill the sodas. And if you are with kids and they need ketchup or any condiment, be prepared to fork up 50 cents. First time I EVER paid for ketchup. AND the manager thought that was ok. (By the way, the server never said there would be a charge either)I would rather they said they had none."}
{"text":"Food was okay but not worth the price!! Shrimp Taco had two skimpy pieces of shrimp in it for $7. Ordered taquitos and it was good but not worth $10.   WORST OF ALL I ORDERED THE RICE AS A SIDE FOR $4 and all I got was this tiny tiny bowl of rice, BARELY 1/2 cup!  Such a rip off."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Colorado Springs, CO for Christmas and stopped in for dinner this evening with our 3 year old and 1 year old. We literally had a perfect dinner...which hard to come by with little ones! ;) Service was fast, friendly and accurate. Drinks were cold and well presented. Dinner was delicious and prompt. Kids were welcomed with Crayola crayons and coloring paper. I would highly recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Mike the bartender and Shelly the server are fantastic.  Best guacamole in Scottsdale. Music is cool and Margaritas are the best. Be sure to try the Barbacoa Tacos are amazing!"}
{"text":"Our great experience began by being seated outside on the nice patio with great misters--a real treat for rain-soaked Seattleites!  Our waiter, Ben, was amazing and treated 7 old ladies like we were as worthy of good service as the other young customers having a good time. He took our orders promptly and accurately, and was most accommodating of our special requests. The food came promptly, every order was done to order, hot, fresh and DELICIOUS!!  Really a great experience--hope to see you again next year Ben--thanks again!!"}
{"text":"Cool spot. The razzmatazz margarita is a must try plus great taco specials for happy hour. 4 stars because sometimes the drinks take a while to get to your table. Not a deal breaker though. Love this place"}
{"text":"I had a very good burrito dish from the lunch menu. I would not hesitate to get get again."}
{"text":"We visited Salt & Lime on a Sunday afternoon. Service was fast and efficient.  We loved the quinoa and shrimp taco and green chili chicken enchiladas. The pineapple salsa was fabulous, as was the tres leches. Price was reasonable and overall the food was very fresh and delicious. We will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"So excited to try this Mexican Grill.  Has a very inviting exterior and the patio is comfortable and relaxed.  The service was excellent.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with selections.  I wish I could rate it higher, however the food was just ok.  We ordered the nachos and probably would not try these again.   They were covered with a queso cheese dip  and not much else.  We would go back, but next time we will try something else and maybe I can rate it higher."}
{"text":"Awful. Took almost 5 minutes after being seated to be greeted by our waitress to take our drink order. (Big pet peeve!) Then the 2 camaron burritos that we ordered were very large but had only 3-4 shrimp and lots of rice.  Obviously trying to get away with using it as filler to charge more for less.  So havw now tried the restaurant twice to give it a good chance. No more. :("}
{"text":"We LOVE Stone and Vine and frequent it almost every week, which is why when the owners opened this restaurant , we were excited to give it a try.   We have tried it three times.  All three times the service was subpar.   It was a like committing a crime to get chips and salsa.  When we got them, we were pleased but only to find out tue extra salsa cost extra.   We are ok with that but it is courteous to let the table know      We stopped ordering Margaritas the first night we stopped in.  Just could not get them right.   After the third try with no improvement on overall service and difficulty in getting chips and salsa, we have given up.  We will stick with Stone and Vine."}
{"text":"I have taken my family to this new restaurant twice.  Oddly, dining options for Mexican food in this area are rather light.  There is a Chipotle by the hospital (block away) and the more traditional Ajo Al's and Miguels about half a mile away.  Those two restaurants are OK, but serve a traditional 'American' mexican food style dish - which, just seems old and tired.   We ate here with two adults and two kids.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and comfortable, if not a little crowded.  There is a very fun looking bar area and patio (but we sat in the dining area).  We saw many people having cocktails and wine at the bar, which is not normally what you would see at a Mexican place, but, it tells you right off the bat that this is not traditional mexican where you either get a margarita or beer.    I am melding my two experiences together to give you a better sense.  We tried:  Casarita - their house slushy margarita, which comes from a machine and tastes great. I had a floater of \"prickly pear\" liquor in it.  I had two, and got my buzz on well.  After I had two the waiter mentioned its a limit of 4 because they have a lot of booze in there.  Shop Special - this is a regular margarita on the rocks.  Seemed good, not sour or tart.  Watermelon Fresca - they make this with booze, or without (I had the booze one).  Holy cow this is a strong drink.  Its water based, with chunks of watermelon - NOT a sweet candy drink.  more like infused water.  Interesting..... and strong..... and happy hour prices :-).  I have never had a cocktail like this.... it felt... healthy in a way.  The food has some goods, and some medicare's.  Chips and salsa is different - they tell you the first salsa is free.  One night we tried the medium pineapple salsa.  The salsa is not like the kind you get from the store.  It looks hand chopped, and is not full of liquid.  My kids loved this, but it seemed as mild as mild could be on the heat index.  The second time we were there, we tried the Tomatillo, which is supposed to be Hot, but to me was medium.  You have had hotter salsa, trust me.  I am not sure if you can tell them to kick it up a bit.  We went through two things of chips, and the one salsa lasted, but it doesn't feel the same without that endless bowl of tomato salsa - I guess I am a purest on that.  The menu is arranged almost like a mexican eatery - there are some full meals, but most feels like a la cart that you are building into a meal.  For instance, my wife and I each had two tacos that ranged in price from $4-6 each, and a side of beans $2.50 and a side of cilantro rice $3.  The total price of the meal was about the same as  you would expect if it was all put together for you.    The taco's are quite large and stuffed, and pretty creative.  We had (over two visits):  A baja taco (not sure if this is the name) - it has a MASSIVE chunk of beer battered fish in it.  We ordered this twice because it was a huge value for money.  An El Pastor taco - ehhhhh, was fatty or something.  I was thinking it was something different (but I ate it).  A veggie taco (not sure of the name) - now this was excellent.  Usually the vegetarian dish is half assed in mexican places.  This was portabella mushrooms and stuffed, and seasoned really well.  I would do this again in a heartbeat.  A Barbacoa taco - yummy, can't go wrong  A Shrimp taco - also very good.  My kids ate off the kids menu.  A quesadilla and bean burrito.  The bean burrito was the best ever.  and it was really large for a kid menu.  If you don't know what to order, get this item (its on adult menu), you will thank me.  Its not like any bean burrito you have ever had.  My wife took the second half to lunch the next day.  The kids were dismayed by \"yucca\" fries on the kid menu, which I thought was a kind of potato or something, but they were sweet potato fries (which the kids hate) so there ya go!  The sides we tried a bunch because they seemed cheap:  Cilantro rice.  Really yummy - its bright green, and very well done.  Could eat this by itself.  Two kinds of beans - don't remember the names.  Both very good - well seasoned.  I am not a bean person, but these I could eat over and over (they are not refried).  corn (which comes out as corn on the cob), on a skewer already buttered.  Apparently we were there on the first week, because there were some hiccups in the wait staff.  Our child's food apparently had not been ordered, and we are the type of family that doesn't eat until its all on the table.  The owner apologized profusely and brought out a free desert - it was a churro, but wasn't perfect or straight like the Disneyland kind.  Everyone said they didn't want it, until we tried it.  A fresh made churro is mind boggling good.  I have never seen a desert like that on any menu, and it was so flipping yummy.  It came with this lemon creme dipping sauce.  I can't explain how interesting this was.  Its different, but not crazy different.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is a must try! Awesome atmosphere! Our server Case was excellent; came around just enough. Gave great recommendations. The decor is just right trendy but not over the top. Great patio with open bar nice for watching basketball. The food was delicious~ highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went with three friends and we were all very pleased with our food. Excellent chips, the chicken fajitas were outstanding, chicken enchiladas were very good. All of us would come again!  Service was great!"}
{"text":"I've been twice now and it is great. This time I had the tamales which certainly are not traditional tamales but they were excellent."}
{"text":"Food is ok and I keep giving then another shot because my husband loves it here but the service is sub-par at best. It's always \"something\" tonight our waiter admitted he forgot our order and did comp our drink after retaking our order.  Ordered soup for my meal  and he brought it out as appetizer and never asked me. Tortilla soup was bland and only had one small bite of chicken in it. Waiters and bus boys run into chair while bustling by and don't even say excuse me. Don't think I'll be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Good BUT not great. I will give them an A for effort because if they could enhance the flavor the rest of the experience was great.   Ambience - Nice Staff - Great and on top of refills Chips - Perfection Salsa - tomato paste ... Lacks flavor Guacamole - Okay  Carne Asada taco - Not great ... Considering this is a Mexican restaurant.  Shrimp taco - Good   Again, everything about the place was great EXCEPT for the food. {Sorry ...}"}
{"text":"Salt & Lime is no longer one of my \"go to spots.\" Sorry two strikes and you are out. Yesterday, the server went to check on my carryout. I looked in the kitchen and she was scooping my chips with her bare hands. Excuse me, dirty hands that were previously scratching her head. When I mentioned such, she denied it and to top it off the manager did not allow her best customer service skills to shine through. As I mentioned to the manager, check your cameras and see for yourself.   My previous visit on April 1, 2016 was a dine in with others. Happy Fool's Day to me. The check came and my friends paid in cash and I used a card. The following day, I checked my account and I was charged for the entire bill with a separate transaction for the bill I signed. Trust, we all make mistakes; however, I expect the server to advise me that she perhaps made an error. I should not have to check my account and call the restaurant."}
{"text":"We have discriminating taste in Mexican food. Love this cozy neighborhood joint. Ingredients in food are fresh and flavorful. Fajitas outstanding, as well as the Mexico City tamales with carne asada on top of deep fried, cheese filled tortilla. Never had a bad meal here, and service friendly and prompt. Had Chuy as waiter last several visits on their patio, very good. Also Gilbert, who is excellent. Margarita Monday's a good time to enjoy their smooth, machine blended house margaritas. Been there many times, still drive back over though we have moved. Never had anything but a great experience."}
{"text":"Thought the food was great until I looked into the kitchen on the way out.  Waiters were patting down the chip baskets without gloves on.  if thats not bad enough they helped themsleves to the same chips, yes those chip baskets that end up on your table. Talked to manager he didn't seem too upset.  What else are they eating after its plated?  I'll pass on this place."}
{"text":"Food and drink mediocre at best.   Tacos were served with raw tortillas.   Drink order was wrong twice.   Great atmosphere came on the first week of opening.  Need to improve basic execution of food."}
{"text":"Went after it been open a couple weeks. They made a big deal about complimentary chips and salsa. Really? At a Mexican restaurant? The house salsa was bland and tasteless.  We ordered the verde salsa that we had to pay for. Also bland. Next the tacos. We both had the Carne Asada. The meat was so tough you could hardly chew it. And the tortillas were gross. Not just soft but you could wring the oil out of them. As another reviewer said they tasted raw. YUCK! I'll go next door to Chipoltle next time."}
{"text":"This place was not good at all . They charged for salsa and the food was burnt . I would not go there again!"}
{"text":"Not impressed, food delivered cold, and the burrito was nothing but rice and a few vegetables, and smothered literally way to much with sauce.  Not impressed, won't be back for dinner..."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food I have ever had in Scottsdale. I live in Tucson and I drive here once a month just for the food. The manager Matt Came over to our table several times and made sure my friends and I had a great time. Unreal! I can't wait to drive back next month!"}
{"text":"For only being open a short time, this place is surprisingly well run. Awesome food, amazing service.. You guys just raised the bar for Scottsdale.  Special thanks to Mixologist Michael and Danielle (aka Detroit Danielle)!"}
{"text":"Salt & Lime makes me happy for so many reasons....  Guacamole - delicious, fresh, big portion, about half the price of guac elsewhere.  Queso - we had the chorizo version once and it was very good but we have had the plain cheese the last three times and it is really delicious.  Quesadilla - tried it without the chicken, portion is huge and stuffed with cheese, not too greasy...just enough to make it indulgent.  Nachos - we have had them a few times (minus chicken) and they really do a nice job here.  The chips are freshly made and they load them up with cheese, pico, sour cream, black beans, corn, and an avocado cream topping.  I feel like driving back for more nachos after typing this they're so good.  Salsa - if you like salsa, do yourself a favor and get the 3 for $5.  Tomatillo salsa is better than you think it's going to be, it's thick and rich and tangy...not the pale green watery stuff you get at other places.  Pineapple - get it.  Habanero - to get such a great smoky flavor with that amount of heat is not easy, this place gets it right.  Chili de Arbol - I was bold on our first trip and said \"no place really serves very hot salsa\" (as it is listed on their menu), I was wrong.  Tacos - Beef Barbacoa taco is the best of the bunch as far as I'm concerned. Carne Asada was good.  Pollo Mole - my husband still talks about this one, he loved it.  Short Rib Barbacoa - we got this for the first time a few nights ago as take out...when I opened the container it was like some wonderful grandma was in the kitchen all day making a delicious Sunday dinner for us to enjoy.  It was a gigantic serving, fork tender, seasoned beautifully with potato and carrot in a brothy gravy.    All this and the prices are outstanding.  Parking can be tough in this busy mall but there is parking in the back."}
{"text":"My friends had been raving about Salt & Lime for a long time so finally I met them there this past Friday. When I got there they were already seated with a basket of greasy chips on the table and a tiny bowl of salsa. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm a quantity salsa eater and tiny bowls just don't cut it for me.  I had checked out the menu the night before and knew I'd order the Carne Asada Taco and the Grilled Ahi taco, both on corn tortillas and a side of black beans. First, the beans were excellent and the Carne Asada Taco was great and made to order. The Grilled Ahi taco was on a flour tortilla (you would think an \"authentic Mexican grill\" would default to corn) and had some strange items in it that weren't listed on the menu, like apple strings. I can be adventurous but I didn't care for apple strings in my grilled fish taco.   I might have asked for a replacement to correct the tortilla but by the time the food came I was already underwhelmed by the service. My friend and I had ordered ice teas which failed to show up. We asked for extra salsa, which had also failed to show. The waiter seemed extremely harried. When I asked what I thought was a simple question while ordering (whether the refried beans contain lard), he didn't know what I meant. We received no refills on the ice teas after they were finally delivered and no other checking up on our table.  This place is really cute, just charming. The patio is perfect for the October weather in Arizona and there's a nice vibe here. The lunch special of two (large) tacos and one side at $10.75 was a good deal and filling. But service, folks.   Still, I'll try again."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Great margaritas, great service, and great tacos. Love the street tacos."}
{"text":"Loved the welcoming vibe and the small plate foods are perfect for me. Delicious Shrimp taco with fresh salsa and just the right amount of tang, not too spicy. Service was great, we had a nice light dinner with 3 friends, everyone had different food and all were happy.  The rumrita was delicious!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  Highly recommend this place for authentic Mexican tacos, great salsa and shrimp burrito!  Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch three weeks after the restaurant opened. Was very impressed with the service. Very attentive staff, food came out quickly, everything was good.   For drinks had the skinny b (cucumber and basil something or other) and the house margarita. Both were good, but the margarita was better. I could see the bar has a good selection of tequila. They should add a tequila flight tasting to the menu to showcase them.   Had the pineapple salsa and the habanero salsa with my complimentary chips and salsa. LOVED the habanero. Great flavor and heat. Liked the pineapple, but not as much as the habanero.   Also had the mole and ahi tacos. Really enjoyed the mole tacos. The ahi ones came in a lettuce wrap but I wish I had gotten a tortilla instead. The lettuce had a hard time holding all of the wonderful filling which was a shame because the ahi was perfect and the toppings were really well conceived.    I'd compare it most closely to z tejas, but with the added bonus of being local. Also, more uniqueness and variety. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great happy hour meal at this location yesterday.  We were treated very poorly at the restaurant Ling and Louie's next door.  So badly that we walked out without even being seated. We walked right next door to Salt and Lime where we were greeted warmly and seated promptly.  It was happy hour so we had the house margaritas.  They were very good and they didn't skimp on the tequila.  We ordered the grande nachos with the chicken tings.  The platter was huge! These were some of the best nachos we have ever eaten.  My husband decided to try the Barbacoa Tacos and he said they were excellent.  We will definitely be back here again.  Great food and wait staff."}
{"text":"Awful food and and that makes me sad as I am a Mexican food junkie. There are plenty of other restaurants around with great Mexican fare than to eat here. Also it took an hour to get our meal for take out on a sleepy Thursday night. We would have walked away if we didn't feel bad for our bartender she is the only reason we stayed and paid for our food."}
{"text":"Great lunch experience. We went with a group of 6 and they were quick to sit us. The group consisted of a vegetarian, a picky eater and 2 high maintenance order-ers.  So, we are a tough group... luckily for all locals restaurants we don't get together much.  S&L did great! There was only one plate sent back and the server was very gracious about it!  The food tasted great. Here is what we ordered: An array of 4 different types of tacos Veggie Taco 2 Salmon salads 1 tostado salad Guac and chips Ceviche   The guac was a little small and my personal preference is that there is more avocado than stuff in it... and I felt it was light on the avocado. Others at the table enjoyed it.   Also the salads were a bit over dressed, a little soggy by the end. But the dressings tasted delicious!   I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and the service was just as fantastic as the first time.  However, there were a couple things that were off.  First, they were out of the medium salsa which is odd, our server said it was because they had gotten slammed the night before.   Don't you make it everyday?   Next, the pork in the street tacos was a little dry. In fact, I had to remove a couple pieces that were grisly hard.  I did give a bonus star for great service which was greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"After 9 years at another, this is now our new favorite Mexican place!   We've went twice in two days and both times it was exceptionally good--with excellent service.    This wonderful restaurant specializes in modern Mexican food.  Don't expect the re-fried-beans-and-greasy-melted-cheddar type Mexican food of traditional Mexican restaurants.  If you are craving something freshly made, with quality ingredients, prepared in an elevated way---go here.  You won't regret it!    The fajitas are fabulous---richly caramelized onions and finely julienned vegetables sizzled to that perfect, deeply tasteful point--done better than anywhere I've ever had before.  They have a ton of flavor!  Well-portioned, too.  I loved every bite, but took half home (we also had chips and guac as an appetizer).  I also tried the Kale Salad.  It was so delicious!!!  It was refreshing to get a good, clean tasting salad with fresh ingredients and nice textures at a Mexican restaurant, where salads are notoriously boring, use head lettuce, pink tomatoes and are loaded with gooey everything.  This salad was a wonderful change-- fresh, light, flavorful and satisfying---truly yummy.    The guacamole is outstanding. So fresh---so delicious!  The salsas are also very good.  The Chili Arbol was our favorite---but the traditional salsa is also good.  One last thing that really sung was the Street Corn.  Ohhhh.... soooo delicious!  You just gotta try it.  Fabulously indulgent.  The manager, Daniel, came by to check in on us and the wait staff were excellent during both visits.  (Gigi and Molly)  The right amount of friendly and attentive.  I could tell that everyone there was proud of where they worked and genuinely cared that we had a great experience.    At first, we hesitated coming as the reviews we read after it first opened were mixed.  At one point (my fault), I thought this was going to be like the \"Modern Margarita,\" (another restaurant in the area that is essentially a night-club-posing-as-a-restaurant).  I was totally wrong.  Wish I hadn't waited so long to give it a try!  The atmosphere was  just right for us.  We are a couple in our early 40s-- we love high quality food and service, but we don't like stuffy, pretentious restaurants.  The area was previously loaded with the former.  Thank goodness places like Salt & Lime are starting to come to this area---realizing that you can have a beautiful restaurant that can pull off a modern rustic feel and make you feel comfortable and happy while having a great meal!  I love a place where you can wear jeans, but get top notch service and dining.  For a ton of reasons, we'll be back many times.  I'm already craving the guac, fajitas, and that kale salad again....  decisions...."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Read about this place in a magazine and really wanted to check it out. I dragged my teenage son with me on a late afternoon during winter break. The food was really good! We started with a chicken quesadilla. My son had the green chicken enchiladas and I had the grilled chicken tacos. It was all very yummy! The drinks were not as good as the food. I first had a strawberry jalapeño margarita. There was no kick to it and the strawberry tasted very imitation. I decided to try the house margarita. It wasn't any better. I could taste the Soda water. It's a shame because I love a good margarita- especially when there is great food to go with it! I would go back for the food and probably just get a beer."}
{"text":"The photo should sum up the experience.  Baja taco is flavorless, just a lump of frozen cod thrown in a deep fryer with some sweet mayonnaise tossed on.   \"Street\" corn here is a joke. Unless you douche your sweet corn in the same carcass the barbacoa was carved from, there isn't any other explanation to how bad it was.   Wait staff was polite, they used common phrases such as \"was this yours?\" and \"I don't know which taco that is.\" - also ignore questions like, \"May we order now?\" and \"I'll have corn on the COB\"   One star for the house margarita, which wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Om effin G. Best meal I've had all week.  Great margaritas, great food. Street corn was OBSCENE! Street tacos awesome. I will be back. Only thing that could have made it better?..... Naked girls."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place? A house margarita that is still way better than most top shelf margaritas, AMAZING enchiladas and short ribs, and a laid back atmosphere. We were served by Heather this evening, who made great food recommendations and provided wonderful service. Seriously, if you like great Mexican food and haven't been here, do yourself a favor and go!  We've been here before and never walk away unhappy. Can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"Great food but they need more servers! The bartender was serving all the hightops as well as everyone at the bar eating and drinking and on a crowded Saturday, this did not work well. She had a great attitude but you could tell she needed help. Tacos are always delicious and the various salsas perfect. Their street corn is some of the best in the Valley!"}
{"text":"I went back last night and I thought the food and service is far better than when I went there when it opened. Yes, they still have not fixed the noise problem yet by adding some sound proofing.  But the food was very good at happy hour and the wait staff are always very friendly.  I highly recommend the Quesadilla at happy hour."}
{"text":"I saw this place when driving down Shea Blvd. and I am EXTREMELY happy that I whipped a u-ie at the next intersection to try this place out! I sat down immediately and was greeted by their great staff and the owner to boot! At the recommendation of the owner I had a barbacoa taco and pork belly taco to start with, which were top notch! High quality pork and a great grill taste! After I enjoyed the first order I HAD to order the street tacos to see what other great things the kitchen could do! Great atmosphere and awesome food! If you are looking for a taste of Mexico with modern (new combinations) tastes, this is your place! Try it out and you will not be disappointed! The staff and owner are a lot of fun as well! Keep up the good work and open another one in Michigan!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Roasted jalapeños as an appetizer was awesome. Salad was good. I had the street tacos and the steak was a little too dry for my taste. Service was slow and unreliable. We weren't in a hurry so that didn't bother us too much."}
{"text":"We went here with a large group of taco enthusiasts. The Salt+Lime tag line should be: \"tacos for old white people who think everything is the greatest thing they've ever had.\"  For future old white people interested in trying the tacos here, I've prepared a translation table for their menu:  Barbacoa = pot roast Al Pastor = sweet and sour pulled pork Roasted corn = sweet corn mush Carne asada = burnt steak Mole = not mole  None of us will be returning customers. Good luck with this place..."}
{"text":"Came here last night and had Michael as our server! He was great! Also the food... the food UH-MAY-ZING!! I will fight for a parking spot any day to have that Grilled Blackened Shrimp Burrito smothered with red enchilada sauce again and again and againnnn."}
{"text":"We love this place. Every type of taco we've tried has been amazing. Came here Early Sunday. Not recommended because of the service first thing in am. Our server seemed brand new and was slow considering we were one of two tables. We watched the bartender swatting bugs the whole time she was behind the bar. Didn't make me want to get a drink for sure. The tacos save the day here!"}
{"text":"I understand this is a \"modern\" Mexican restaurant but... I don't believe it's Mexican at all! I'm Mexican... There is nothing Mexican about melting cheddar yellow cheese with sausage and calling it queso fundido with chorizo! Wow not to mention ceviche means cooked by means of acid so using lime to cook fish usually means ceviche!!! No one in Mexico puts tomato sauce in ceviche this is not modern! This place pretty much butchered Mexican culture! I'm not even gonna make a big deal about the manager's outfit! Peace"}
{"text":"This place could be a five star if they had decent service. We go once every couple months because their tacos and margaritas are outstanding, but the service is awful. We always have to wait at least 10-15 minutes to order a drink. We end up filling up on chips an salsa because it takes so long to order and get out mains."}
{"text":"Great find...we decided to try this fairly new arrival to the Mexican food market, and, glad we did. The restaurant decor is very nice, including a large bar. They also have a nice patio for outside dining. We were greeted at the door promptly and decided on outside dining with the evening being nice. Our waitress was prompt in taking our drink order and returned with chips and a great roasted salsa. We choose the Green Chili ENCHILADAS, which were excellent. Creamy and spicy with moist chicken. Our other selection was the gourmet tacos. Choosing the Baja fish taco, filled with a nicely battered white fish fillet, fresh cabbage, and wonderful sauce. The other was the carne asada taco. The meat was tender and moist, and very flavorful. They are served on either corn or flour tortilla, or, as a lettuce wrap. At $4.50 this was priced right. We ordered a side of Charro Beans, which could use some spice/heat. The prices were very good. The chips and salsa, first rate. The service was very good, too. We would definitely return to try more items on the menu..."}
{"text":"Good food.  Good happy hour.  I think what I like best about the place is the service.  Bartenders and waitstaff are always great."}
{"text":"Decent food, incredibly slow service. :(. Came for lunch. Only a few patrons. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and so does the rest of my family! It's a really great restaurant with authentic Mexican which is hard to find. Also, one server named Gilbert is AMAZING he has extremely fast service and is always a great server and is very fun and truly great. If you go to this great restaurant please recommend Gilbert."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were great.   Awesome happy hour prices.   We split the tacos  the shrimp and the fish tacos were the best.   Our waiter was great. He spent time talking to us while We were on the Patio  We will be back can't beat the tequila and tacos here"}
{"text":"Prices are great, customer service even better! Best tacos in town.  Came here for a girls night out and it looks like this will be our new spot."}
{"text":"The server was awesome! Margaritas(stingy with the alcohol) had 2 and felt nothing. Food was just ok. Happy Hr drinks were $2 off the regular price as well as the food we had that was just ok. Not worth the 50-plus dollar bill for two doing happy hour that included two margaritas a piece  and 2 appetizers."}
{"text":"Great tasting food!  Server Ron rocked!  Margarita was tasty.  I had the street taco experience...  tried one each of pork, chicken and the carne asada and was not disappointed!  The veggie side was very good!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  The wait staff is very friendly and the happy hour menu is delicious.  I recommend the grande totopos appetizer with pot roast meat!  Very cute decor too!!"}
{"text":"Place is always clean and staff is always nice. Great food and great staff. The manager always comes by to check on our service and food. Mild for Mexican but always cooked right! Never a single issue ever, Gilbert is awesome. Thanks!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots.  The mango tango margarita is the bomb!  I usually sit at the bar because Joe gives the best service.  The short rib taco is also amazing.  Definitely try this place."}
{"text":"The first time I went with my husband and we were ignored we had to ask for service it was totally the server he was LAZY.  BUT the food was great so I went back(that server wasnt there whew) I took my friend and her daughter the food again so good but the absolute is the salsa you can order three types of salsa, I got both the HOT ones and a mild one.  Holy cow the best salsa I have ever had super HOT I also got a salad with chicken very very good. and the service this time excellent.  This place is worth the time to check out.  I just hope you dont get that cruddy waiter.  Maybe by sitting closer to the bar?  who knows it is worth it."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and patio.  Good service. The food was just ok. We had the house salsa, pineapple salsa and the guacamole.  They were ok, but had too much lime and I love lime.  The appetizer chicken chimichanga was ok. The chicken mole taco tasted like chicken thighs, which I am not a fan of.  I was told it was chicken breast. My husband had the green chili chicken enchilada and it was good.  We were excited to try a New Mexican restaurant and were disappointed."}
{"text":"The service was efficient, the restaurant was well-designed and clean, and the food was fresh and tasty. The pollo asado burrito was very tasty, especially the melted crema and Oaxaca cheese!  The guac was decent, nothing special, but good. The salsa was fantastic, perfect blend of spices and not too chunky. I would come here again"}
{"text":"Everything on the happy hour menu was great, service is above average and the margaritas are a house specialty for a reason."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've visited this restaurant for lunch and this is the first time I've been disappointed. Your new menu is fine, but now you have to pay extra to experience the chips and salsa. The waitress will bring you a flavorless version salsa that resembles ketchup with spices, but it doesn't compare to the pineapple salsa, or verde salsa you now have to pay for. This is not good customer service. Having to pay extra for your good salsa seems cheap. Just take it off the menu if you're not going to allow people to try it.   As for the food: Burritos are tasty, Relleno is okay, the beef, shrimp and pork tacos are yummy. I tried the Baja taco today ... Icky! It resembled battered frozen fish from  a grocery store. It's far from Baja!   The service has been good and the beer is cold, chips are crunchy and hot, but again, don't get your hopes up on the salsa. If you want good, free salsa, go to Blue Adobe Grill on Frank Lloyd Wright. It's delicious and complimentary."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for the meal portions, slow service and average food quality. I paid over $80 just for lunch for four, the burritos were presented like appetizers served as wraps with no sides included, I even had to order a side of rice which came out plain white rice with corn bits rather than Spanish rice. We could have had full size meals at traditional Mexican restaurants rather than some trendy setting with loud annoying techno-disco music blaring. I'll take a traditional restaurant at a fair price over this place."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood cantina. I have been three times now and tried something new every time. I just had the green chili chicken enchiladas and they were truly amazing. The tacos are filled with flavor, and the chips and salsa are fresh and top notch which is my primary indicator for Mexican food. The only place that they fall slightly short is average margaritas. There is a great patio, comfortable dining area and a very inviting bar area. All in all, I recommend a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great tacos and queso fundido. Margaritas were awesome. Service is very good."}
{"text":"Service was really slow and the food was not even remotely appetizing or tasty.  I ate the protein out for energy and skipped the rest.  Margaritas only ok, and dessert the same.  I wouldn't recommend it, nor will I return."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised! We loved the house salsa and had a variety of tacos. All were excellent but barbacoa was the best! Service by Al was friendly and speedy. We can't wait to return. If the next experience is as good as the first, this will become our favorite go to for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Have to say that I've been coming here since this places opened. First time I have ever been ignored, meaning I was seated and no server came over to offer me a drink or take my order. I was going to change my review status to a lower grade, but a nice young lady (who is a manager) kindly came over to apologize and surprisingly offered to cover my tab for the evening. This place knows how to handle situations both good and bad. Thumbs up to the Salt & Lime management rocks! Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"I had a few different tacos and they were delicious (especially the pork belly taco), but what made this five stars was the service! Gilbert and Kaitlin were so friendly to us and patient with other patrons. Great Happy Hour deals!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of these trendy \"gastro-pub\" places. A little to \"hipster\" for my blood. Anyway....  We went in for a quick bite and that's pretty much what we got. We both ordered the \"street tacos\". I love that term. \"Street tacos\". Especially when served at a trendy gourmet type \"gastro pub\". It's the best oxymoron of modern cuisine.   We also ordered the small quac and chips with salsa. The garden salsa is really bland and the \"hot\" variation isn't much hotter. The salsa verde was the best. Especially on those gourmet street tacos. I had the carnita, beef, and chicken tacos. Of the three, the pork was the best. The beef a little bland, and the chicken dried out and stringy. The guacamole was the furthest thing from traditional guacamole I've ever had. Oranges slices?  Weird. Can't say I was a fan.   Anyway. Two appetizer orders of street tacos, chips and quac, an iced tea and a coke = $30 bucks and still hungry.   Not sure if I'll go back. I get the \"gastro pub\" business model. I just don't drink enough to appreciate it much anymore. If I did still drink like I used to, I would have found the food unquestionably delicious."}
{"text":"Great place! The deco was comfortable and fitting. I started with the homemade tortilla chips and the salsa sampler. All were very good and high quality. I had an el pastor taco, pork belly taco, and carnitas taco. They came out on a taco rack type of plate which was unique. I thought all three were great but the pork belly taco was awesome.  Our server Jade was very good and had nice suggestions since it was our first visit. Definitely a \"go to\" taco joint!!"}
{"text":"Woooo, horribly overpriced, and iffy service. Went out with friends for drinks and food. Had the  ahi tacos (horribly overcooked, lacking any flavoring) a patron on the rocks, split guac (that was delicious) with the table. Boyf had street tacos and a patron and our bill was $100. Our server was extremely hard to find and there were all of 5 tables in the restaurant. Not to mention, they closed at 11 and at 10 they started flipping chairs over onto tables and the busser came over and asked us for our salt and pepper, drink book etc. When we cracked a joke to him about it he proceeded to go inside, talk to the other wait staff about us and point at us. You're closing down the restaurant with tables still in it. The waitstaff were loudly discussing how they had never closed before (probably new) -- just awkward. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, same as other Yelp reviews. Waited a long time for service, nobody came. Asked hostess if someone could help us and she said someone would come. Waited a long time again and finally a waitress came. Waitress excuse 'we are busy'. I therefore asked for a manager. They just send another waiter to help us, no manager.  The last thing you want to do, especially in Scottsdale, is have customers wait, especially for food that also didn't get such high reviews.  A suggestion would be to get new manager, retrain staff, hire more help, and have the hostess manage expectations."}
{"text":"We liked our happy hour experience. I agree $5.50 for a happy hour margarita is high but I don't think it is extreme. The nachos at $8.25 seemed high, the tacos at $4.25 and $3.50 seemed fair. We liked it. Waitress was attentive. We will be back"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? Anything less than five stars is just your internal curmudgeon looking for attention. The food here rocks! Atmosphere is awesome. Seating outside was perfect. Not to loud. In from Chicago, grew up in Arizona and this food was phenomenal. We had a big group of ten, the food was fast and the staff was awesome! Margaritas the real thing. Try the barbacoa tacos and the pork belly tacos. The street tacos and corn on the cob... Killer!  My teenage kids stated the baked churros are the best they ever had. The lemon tequila butter sauce for these is to die for! If you want the best food at a good value come try the Salt and Lime!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while. What better day than Cinco de Mayo. We were not disappointed. Started off with the smoked chicken jalapeño poppers,umm can I say..ridiculously good. I had the Carnitas & hubby had Barbacoa short ribs. The best Carnitas EVER.  Perfectly cooked came with this lime sauce that was seriously unbelievable. The Barbacoa was also delicious. No skimping on portions at all!! The poppers were a meal in itself. We will definitely go back when we're back in the area."}
{"text":"Where to start.. Decided to check this place out during happy hour with 4 people. Food and service was great and loved the atmosphere. HOWEVER.. We decided to take our family of 10 there for a birthday dinner last night and it was the.worse.service.everrrrr!!!!!! Don't get me wrong the food was still very good but our waitress was rude,ignored us, was lazy and had a bad attitude. Never did she tell us that only the FIRST round of chips and salsa was free and they charge every time after, then she wouldn't even bother to come back to refill our chips, salsa or water. The bus man was the one taking care of us most the night. One of our guests came late and she was aware of that and left him hanging for 10 min without coming back to get his order. And lastly, she refused to split our checks. We all were in couples and wanted it to be split per couple. She just threw down our 1 check and said \"we'll get this figured out\" and again left our table! We asked for an order of churros for dessert but wanted prices on them first, she said she didn't know off the top of her head but \"they aren't that expensive\" turns out it was near $11 for one order!!! Never bothered to tell us that and we ended up ordering 3 of them.. We tried to talk to the \"manager\" about how poorly our service was and he failed to even comp the churros or my brothers birthday beer that was spilled since the tables were ALLL UNEVEN! Needless to say the food was good, but paying almost $70 for fajitas, 2 tacos and churros is just ridiculous to me! There's no excuse of why she couldn't split our checks and even comped at least 1 order of churros. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick lunch here last week. I had the chicken bowl, it was not good at all. The chicken resembled something that would be on a cheap teriyaki bowl at a fast food chain. The rice and beans were bland. The whole thing was nearly inedible if you wanted flavor.   On the positives, service was quick and friendly. The people I dined with enjoyed their selections. I would go back to give them another try but I would definitely order something completely different.   It's a super cute restaurant with a nice looking bar, maybe a good spot for a happy hour drink."}
{"text":"Good and quick service, Happy hour prices!   The grilled snapper taco was good.  I wasn't too hungry since we started off with chips and guacamole. It wasn't the best I have had, but it was moderately good."}
{"text":"This place started out gang-busters, but since opening the quality of the food has gone downhill and the drinks are weak enough to serve to a newborn. They have also started nickel and diming with a charge now for refills on chips and salsa. Too bad, we were going there on a weekly basis and now we will probably skip it."}
{"text":"This is a nice new watering hole for the area, which serves some Mexican inspired pub grub.   We came for Happy Hour around 5 on a Saturday afternoon. Granted, it was probably unfair of us to come here after last week's foodie extravagance at Gallo Bianco in Phoenix.  But we found the food good and the drinks cold, always a plus.   The atmosphere is a cross between a sports bar and a Mexican beach cantina. They have a large bar area which extends out onto the sidewalk. You can sit on bar stools outside, on a ceramic window area and still see the game on their two HDTVs inside.   Salt and Lime is a bar where Dos Equis Lager, Corona Light or Modelo Dark are on tap for $4.00 and come in a pint glass, while their small wine list was $7 a glass. Salt & Lime doesn't carry or serve Sangria. They also had several margaritas on the menu starting at $6 and going up from there.   The food was good and what you would expect. We started with Guacamole for $5.50 (photo) and shared an order of Nachos ($8.50).  The guacamole had some mango through it, which made it interesting; while the nachos were drizzled with several different types of cheeses. Not bad for bar food.   Since these appetizers were filling, we ordered some Empanadas ($5.25) and a couple of Tacos for $3.25 each. The empanadas came with shredded chicken(photo) but were overly doughy and had a flour after-taste. The Carne Asada tacos were good, but admittedly we were spoiled from last week's adventure at Gallo.   The bill came to $42.75 plus taxes and gratuities, so expect to pay $27 each unless you're very thirsty. LOL.   We found Salt & Lime Three Stars, A-Okay"}
{"text":"Street taco meat was over cooked and the black beans were completely under cooked. Server spilled our host's dish. Probably not going to come back here again."}
{"text":"All I gotta say is PORK BELLY TACOS . The bomb and one of the best tacos I've ever had. They are served in a bigger shell than most places so all you really need is 2 . Omg craving them now"}
{"text":"Worst dinning experience i have ever had in Scottsdale. The food was cold and we had to wait over 45 minutes for out entrées.   Poor service."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight. Ordered a margarita and they were out of limes. Inexcusable"}
{"text":"Been couple of times... Good service, nice staff... My mum likes their chicken tacos & I had the quinoa salad & added some shredded chicken which made it very tasty.  She also fell in LOVE with their churros for dessert, says best ever had in this country!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Everything that I have tried on the menu is fantastic. The happy hour prices are worth it. Excellent service for a large group of us on a Friday night. The ladies room even had a station of essentials for you if you needed (i.e. Bobby pins, hairspray) That itself was pretty amazing. Will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Once again we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Food is never disappointing and service has been always great. Being that it's a short drive from Fountain Hills, this makes the restaurant perfect for us."}
{"text":"Made an impromptu reservation for 10 of my colleagues - they accommodated without blinking an eye.  Everyone who was in attendance has raved about the food/service - as a newly transplanted person from WA state - glad I found a good \"go to\" for my leadership team.  We will be back!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I've dined in at this restaurant multiple times and the food is always been great. Tonight I called a head of time to confirm the  happy hour time frame. Then I subsequently ordered tacos thinking I would get the happy hour price. The individual on the phone made no mention that carry out would not be applicable for the happy hour prices. I did bring it to the attention to the individual bringing the food, however, they just said that's how it is. Can't help but to feel misled, would have been nice if it was corrected."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time the other night with friends.  My Ahi tuna taco was very dry and no flavor.  The appetizer which was the stuffed poblano peppers with chicken was ok.  Again, really no flavor that would make you say, \"wow, this is great\"!  Spicy though, which is good.  I've traveled around a lot and have eaten at a lot of restaurants over the years, so I am very fussy when it comes to my food.  I would just say, it was ok.  Busy atmosphere.  Very popular place.  Young people.  The service was good."}
{"text":"Have to say this last visit yesterday May 2nd. Nobody acted like they were ready for anything. The manager behind the bar advising new bartender how to make a margarita. The so called chili relanjano was plopped with a bunch of so called carnita on top of an under done pablano pepper and it was cold. Our waiter Ron was great but their idea of a celebration of an anniversary and fiesta left a lot to be desired. I have been here several times now. Very inconsistent and the employees are a revolving door. Not to mention the manager kept interviewing newbies while we were there. Not sure I'll ever be back. They're not cheap"}
{"text":"Nice place. Good margaritas. Go for the frozen ones. Service was good. No wait. They took good care of me at the bar."}
{"text":"Salt & Lime has fabulous tacos & guacamole! Their beef barbecoa taco comes with a choice of corn tortilla or flour. I recommend corn as I have tried it with both. It is chili braised short ribs that melt in your mouth topped with Oaxaca cheese and pico de gallo. This was a huge hit! Their chips and salsa that come to the table complimentary are also always warm, crispy and fresh. I have enjoyed myself the three times I have visited Salt & Lime and plan to come back this summer! I also enjoyed them sending out coupons to the nearby neighborhoods which allowed me to try them for the first time! Good thinking, S & L!  Update!! Your iced tea is VERY weak!"}
{"text":"A friend and I met here for lunch yesterday bc it was the half way point from both of our jobs. The chips and salsa was amazing. She ordered a vegetarian bowl and I ordered a chicken bowl. It looked yummy when it arrived bc it was covered in guacamole and pico. When I started mixing it around something didn't look right, sure enough I pulled RAW chicken out of it! I have a sensitive stomach as it is so thank God I stopped myself from eating it! I set the raw pieces on the side of my plate hoping our waiter would come by and see it. He never came back by to ask how we were doing so I finally handed it to the bus boy who took it away. Our waiter finally shower up with our check which showed he had removed my plate from the bill but didn't say a word! No thank you or I'm sorry! Very disappointed and will never be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous. Great service, wonderful food. So inexpensive I thought the quantities would be small. But they're huge. My husband took half his $10 burrito home. Tacos were $5 so I ordered 2, picturing small tacos but they were overflowing and tasty. I had fried avacado and huachinango (snapper). Best ever.  The place is small and noisy but good food is so rare I'd go back weekly if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos.  All of them I've tried are great.  They are large and def justify the price.   Great service as well.  One of our go-to spots."}
{"text":"If your a fan of weak overly sweet margaritas, American/Mexi food that's bland, made with mostly very dry meats, in a very LOUD rubbing elbows bar and circus like atmosphere this is for YOU!   We entered the small restaurant and were almost knocked out by the loud volume of 70s classics anthem songs. As we sat we were quickly served a basket of half crushed chips and a salsa that lacked typical salsa flavors. Since there was four of us we ordered a pitcher of margaritas. After one sip I found the margarita cloyingly sweet and almost liquor free. It was like sucking on hummingbird water. Someone was running around giving everyone tickets for a floatation giveaway in the bar. The number was called soon after and someone left with a nifty corona floatation raft.  A table gets sat next to us and one person from our table really didn't have any space between them and the person from the next table.  We all thought tacos would be a good appetizer since they were on special for happy hour. My husband's short rib taco was very dry and was bland. It lacked fresh herbs and chiles, it was very flat as well as the tacos the other people had at the table. I had the snapper taco. They did prepare the fish better than all the other meats but it also lacked flavors and the flavor it did have was mostly just strong vinegar from the pickled onions. It lacked fresh green onions, fresh cilantro and a pop of chiles would have been nice. It just tasted vinegary with really super sweet chunks of pineapple that seemed like sweetened canned pineapple.  Out of the three appetizers, the drinks, and four dinners only my dinner was actually very good. But I got the kale and mango salad. My salad was prepared nicely, it was tasty and what really surprised me was that the salmon was cooked very nicely. I do note that this might have been the most expensive item on the menu and was a WHOPPING $18.75 for a salad. I know it's Scottsdale but that is higher pricing than what a salad cost on the strip in Las Vegas. I also note the salad did come in small and large and when I asked about the difference my interpretation was that the small looked like a four inch side salad and the large looked like about a foot.   My husband had the carnitas that was very dry and undeveloped with flavor.  One person at the table had the carne asada fajitas. They were very dry and that person told the waitress and she offered to make a new dish  and latter took the fajitas off the bill.  I thought our server was friendly and efficient.  This is a mixed review but overall it averages to below average so that equals two stars to me."}
{"text":"Came for lunch today, great service and food was very good. Al pastor and Barbacoa tacos are excellent. Snapper taco is average. Guacamole is good but too sweet for my taste as the put mandarin oranges in it, not really to my palate. Margarita- just ok nothing special. Didn't taste like it was just fresh squeezed lime and a bit watered down. Overall a good experience and will be back."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour. Outside of that I'd say the entrees are a little overpriced for a mid level Mexican restaurant. The vibe in there is a cool and they have outdoor seating. I've never struggled to get a seat at the bar during happy hour which is nice. The service is good and they have a decent tequila selection. I definitely like it and come here occasionally as I live in the neighborhood. I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Can not express how great the service here is. Top of the line food, I have been here many times, and the aura in the entire place is remarkable. The manager there, Matt, is always walking around greeting tables and food and drinks are to die for. Would absolutely recommend this place to any person. 5* in my books. This is my favorite restaurant in the desert!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"1st time here and came for lunch!  Great looking decor, very comfortable. Terrific and attentive staff that really knows what their food tastes like so that they can answer questions. The chips were not greasy and salsa amazing (on the sweeter side which I like). I had the Chili Relleno filled with carnitas. The meat was spectacular as was the rest of it. Came with red and green sauce. Beautiful presentation. Can't wait to come back and have Carnitas for dinner. Also had the Chicken Tanga taco. The meat was tender and flavorful. Only had one and did not need more for a lunch (taco was totally filled)! We will definately be back! If we didn't have dinner plans, we would be here tonight!! GREAT to finally have wonderful Mexican fare in the area!"}
{"text":"Why is it only cows get two stomachs - what was god thinking?  I could have used another one last night after taking down those first two chicken tacos, but being the conservative diner I am, I stopped at five so my fellow diners wouldn't think I'm a hog. I'm glad I did too.  A fine selection of Mexican beer and a pretty waitress managed to do their handiwork after the dozen or so pints just sort of snuck-up on me. That's when I started ordering tacos like judgment day was fast approaching. It was about this time I started thinking how handy it'd be to have two stomachs; the first to process the beer and the other for tacos n' shit. Jesus, I would have cleaned 'm out of tacos last night.  The chicken is charred black and tastier than all hell. The corn tortillas were above average with a slight sweetness. The salsa was weird, but fuck it, the tacos were tasty enough on their own.  Anyhow, fuel eating doesn't play here. It's either sport or feelings, pick one. I did both but I'm paying for it today, farting all nine musical octives.  If my sphincter was a bit tighter, I could probably hit high C."}
{"text":"So glad we decided to check out this new restaurant! We went for lunch so it didn't end up being super crowded. The service was amazing- our drinks were constantly full.  The guacamole was fantastic and if you order one thing on the menu, seriously, make it the street corn. That stuff is unreal. The tacos we tried, Baja and Pollo en Mole, were good but nothing to write home about. Our only complaint was the music. We didn't think it was too loud like other yelpers suggest, but it they were playing sad, slow country ballads. Not exactly what I would think of for their atmosphere and definitely not my preferred genre."}
{"text":"- Loved the bartender! She was spunky and the drinks were strong.  When I recommended a tequila change she made it at no charge so she could try it! - Huge street tacos.  Option to use lettuce bibs Tasty - The nacho appetizer is huge.  wLots of toppings and lots of chicken - Liked the atmosphere  When I came here there's a ling & louie's next door and I accidentally went in there thinking it was the mexican restaurant (oops)"}
{"text":"We were actually heading next door for dinner, when I saw this restaurant.  It looked like a cute place (people sitting on the patio and flat screens all over), and I was craving some chips and salsa so we decided to check it out.  They brought us a basket of chips with a small bowl of their fresh salsa.  I ordered the triple salsa so I could try three more (pico, habanero, and tomatillo) for $5.  The pico was okay, tomatillo was a little sweet, but the habanero was AMAZING (super spicy with a great flavor!).  I had the skinny margarita (really good), ordered the nachos for dinner, and my boyfriend ordered quesadillas.  My nachos were amazing!  Although every chip was covered with toppings, they did not get soggy throughout dinner.  The chips served with the salsa were fresh and crispy, and I used them to eat some of the additional toppings that were falling off the nachos.  My boyfriend also ate the nachos with me (we didn't even finish them!) and only ate 1 piece of his quesadilla (there were 4).  He said the quesadilla was alright, but we both agreed the nachos were awesome!  The best thing about this restaurant was the service, though.  Our waiter was very friendly and ensured we always had what we needed.  Overall, this is a great spot and I'm glad we ended up stumbling into it on a Sunday night for dinner :)"}
{"text":"The most phenomenal queso chorizo dip in the universe! The muchca tacos were phenomenal as well. Unfortunately the margaritas on tap were quite literally the worst I have ever tasted. Perhaps if I had stuck to cervesa it would've been one of the finest Mexican meals of my life."}
{"text":"$7 chicken bowl, gauc with black beans. Chipotle is good and convenient, but this bowl was much tastier, and actually cheaper."}
{"text":"Great new find! Wonderful staff great atmosphere and the food was amazing! First street tacos I had had where you have the option to get them in a lettuce cup. Had the snapper and pork while my husband had the chicken, ahi, and snapper tacos. Great alternative for those that are a little more  health conscious! Would go back again."}
{"text":"We ordered the mini-chimichangas as an appetizer, the Mexican corn side, and an assortment of tacos for dinner. All our food was tasty, and the prices were reasonable. The clientele was a little older (at least on the weeknight we were out), which can probably be attributed to the North Scottsdale location. Cool place for Scottsdale, but there are plenty of authentic Mexican restaurants in Central Phoenix that I prefer."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for tacos, didn't realize it was Taco Tuesday the place was crazy jam-packed.  questioned should we stay or go.??  Scored 2 seats at the bar immediately bartender  greeted us cleared the area brought over water  Chips & salsa, as busy as it was,,, I have to say  Quinn our bartender was amazing..!!!  not only did she take care of us but all who sitting at the bar. GIRL you ROCK !! job well done.10 stars 2 U !! Margaritas were delicious  food as usual was fantastic..!!  can't wait to go back.."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been coming to Salt and Lime for years and tonight we had exceptional service from our waiter Ron. We made a few modifications on our order and everything came out perfect. The food and drinks were great as always!Thank you for the stellar service, Ron! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The whole experience was very good.  Service was great.  A little vacant on Monday lunch time.  First I received the complimentary Fresh Salsa and Stale Chips.  The chips are definitely stale, yucky.  The salsa was good, 4-stars.    The queso fundido dip was 4.25 and tasted stale as well, or just old queso, 2-stars.  I ordered the tamales lunch special with carne asada.  This was actually pretty good.  I would give it 4.5 stars though it is the first time I ate a tamale that looked like this.  Not a bad deal for $10."}
{"text":"Amazing modern mexican food full of flavor.   Having multiple salsa flavor options is fantastic.  The rellenos appetizer is incredible as is the pork dinner and pork street tacos.  Salads and soups are incredible!   Not the typical rice and beans of other mexican restaurants!  Very fresh ingredients ... absolutely amazing flavors!"}
{"text":"Food and service awesome. Plenty of vegetarian food choices and other Mexican food favorites available. Service fast and great environment. Meatless Monday a great day to try new things! #MBYorkbeautyammo"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food was delicious and the staff is friendly with not just the customers but each other. Joe, Heather, and Shannon were the best! Thanks guys---will definitely be back for more street tacos.     Just came in again, same awesome service! Always come here when I'm around."}
{"text":"The flavors are very good but too much fru-fru then it became a huge mess. No need to cover everything with a ton of lettuce then cheese then sauce.   Very good house red sangria. Great service from Alec."}
{"text":"Worst manager ever!  Sitting on patio with 7 people when she walks up out of nowhere and says you all need to leave, I have a party of 20 coming and I'm the manager so you have to get out of here. Rudest experience ever. When I asked our waitress for owners phone number or email she returns and says he will just refer you to me so say what you have to say and then get out.  After talking to a couple additional wait staff it was clear they all feared her. She has no business being in a management position with her clear lack of people management and customer management abilities. If you are the owner I suggest you find another manager that will treat your customers and staff with respect. Will never return to this establishment as a result."}
{"text":"Walked in waited 10 minutes and not one person came to the table or even acknowledged that my family was there. At least 2 servers walked by my table more than 5 times. My family and I just got up and left. WILL NEVER RETURN. .... EVER."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Fantastic service and delicious salsa! The Carne Asada burrito is phenomenal! They have incredible Guacamole and their Ahi Tacos are delicious  definitely try this place if your in the area"}
{"text":"I would have given this place 3 stars but they don't advertise on their website or menu that you only get one complimentary basket of chips and one small dish of salsa. If you want more that'll be $2.00 each time they bring you more. This was pretty much the theme of the night. I ordered the fajitas which didn't come with any cheese or lettuce, so I ordered some on the side at a cost of $1.00 each for these little cups of it. The fajita entree was $15.00 to begin with so I seriously think they could give you some cheese and lettuce to put on your tortilla. They brought me 4 tortillas with the entree and when I asked for more our waitress brought 2 for another $1.00. It might just be me but $1.00 for two corn tortillas is a bit steep. Besides for the prices this place was pretty good. It was a bit noisy but clean and the food was good just not for the price. For 3 people the bill ended up being $65.00 with one appetizer, three entrees and no drinks since we all drank water."}
{"text":"A mexican place with TWO vegetarian tacos?! I couldn't believe my good fortune! Was excited to finally give salt and lime a try. We loved the decor, it's smaller than I expected but the atmosphere is great! We started off with guacamole and I liked it, but felt Id was a tad too chunky. I had a little trouble deciding what to order, wasn't sure if I wanted fajitas, a veggie burrito, or tacos. It was happy hour and you get a dollar off tacos which is awesome so I went for the tacos!  I got one vegetable taco that had a bunch of different veggies on it, and another taco that was fried avocado with mango slaw on it. The veggie one was my favorite, the avocado one was only ok, I just thought the flavors didn't work together for me. Also I would've preferred the tortillas to be a tad crispy, but that's just my personal preference! I ordered black beans as a side as well and they were good! Put some on my veggie taco. I think next time I'll give the veggie burrito a try, but overall I was happy!"}
{"text":"Went in to check out Happy Hour as well as the new digs.  Small bar and restaurant.  Give it 2 because a happy hour margarita was $5.50.. I would think a batch margarita out of a coke keg would be less.  The margarita itself was terrible.  Tasted like the bottom of a sour mix, not refreshing at all. Bartender salted the rim like a Chicago driveway in a deep freeze, yuck.  The beer price for happy hour was $4 which is a much better option than the margarita.  Still for happy hour the prices were high.  Location is also a tough spot. The bartender was nice and social, doubt I'd give this place another shot."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here several times and each time we are so pleased. Their shrimp fajitas and guacamole are amazing!!!  I personally think everyone would     come back multiple times, just as we have because their food is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I got a coupon in my mail box so I tried out this place, they have amazing pork belly tacos and really good fajitas"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a bit underwhelming. We had great service here and the happy hour prices are great but the food is mediocre.  I had the kale salad w/ shrimp & mango and it was ok. I really liked the flavoring on the shrimp. The guacamole was good- basic but fine.  Where the food was super disappointing was the tacos. Both my mom and husband didn't like any of the tacos they ordered. The flavor and temperature of the tacos was off.    If you want a margarita and an appetizer this place would be fine but don't expect much more than that."}
{"text":"We just returned from a terrible experience here.  We have been many times as this is in our neighborhood. Always had an acceptable experience until tonight. Given - 20 min wait for 6 people at 530 on a Friday night . It's a small restaurant so we are use to this. After about 20 min we saw a table for 6 being cleared . It was then given away to a party that just walked in. After questioning multiple people, the manager admitted that the owner knew those people and gave the table away causing us to wait almost twice as long as promised. Then, my meal was completely forgotten and I was unable to eat most of my meal with my family. We will never return, and as a fellow business owner, I hope the owner learns to treat all their patrons with the same respect. In a town with a Mexican restaurant on every corner, I would urge you to pick another."}
{"text":"Delicious, yummy, and a good price! Me and my boyfriend went for lunch at 12:00pm on a Saturday and the place was pretty dead. Only feedback that I can give to the restaurant was that it was very quiet. Almost uncomfortable to where everyone could hear what you were saying. The place is pretty small, so that could have been why too. But some music/radio would have been nice! Other than that, the service was outstanding, food was very tasty (I had the taco sampler and my boyfriend had one of the burritos). They give you unlimited chips and salsa (the salsa is fresh and not too spicy which I loved). Great place to get lunch!:)"}
{"text":"We have come here on two separate occasions now, and have been nothing but satisfied. I'm not normally a go to taco lover, but these tacos are worth a try! They are large, and their flavors/selections are  great! I went for the shrimp taco, and hubby went for the barbacoa taco....twice. we were super delighted w our choices. The chili relleno appetizer was pretty good. Not a very big chili, but lots of tasty sauce, cheese and other ingredients. I like that they have different salsa choices....pineapple, habanero, and my hubby's fave the arbol(sp? The other hot option). The veggie burrito enchilada style was awesome! I love that each time I've dined here I've tried something new and really liked it! Wait staff was a tad slow, but we weren't in a hurry. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy eating at this Mexican restaurant. Salsa is pretty tasty and we always order the queso. My son likes the chicken quesadilla and my husband and I always get the tacos. Service is usually great too!! I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I have been driving by this restaurant for weeks wanting to try it and we finally did. Good thing we waited because it just opened this week! Very impressed. The food was delicious and the service was quick and attentive. The hot habanero salsa had a good kick to it and my friend even declared it inedible due to the spiciness so fortunately for me I got it all to myself. She also said the shrimp tacos were the best she's ever had. My boyfriend is a very plain eater and the restaurant was able to accommodate our request for a \"plain bean and cheese burrito\" with no hesitation. I will probably come back in the afternoon sometime for lunch when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa sub par.  Cheap tequila in the margarita.  Green chile enchiladas were saucy and too tangy, without any real definition between ingredients.  Atmosphere open in a bad way--one big room with a bunch of tables.  Overall, dive quality food at Scottsdale prices.  Will not return."}
{"text":"We were planning on sitting outside, but come to find out the patio didn't have any sun. Although, the inside had a nice atmosphere. I ordered 3 street tacos with an extra side of rice, because the street tacos were mini. They have a nice selection of kids options. You get 2 complimentary baskets of chips & salsa. Service was fast and kind.  The 3 desserts they had sounded delicious, but unfortunately all 3 were deep fried & that hurts my dads stomach so we popped over next Store to the ice cream shop."}
{"text":"We liked everything we had. Our server was awesome. Barbacoa and pork belly tacos, green chile chicken enchiladas. House margaritas."}
{"text":"Horrible. I was here with my kids a month and a half ago. Had extra baskets of chips, no charge. Meat was cooked to perfection when I ordered und fajitas. Kid's good was good. Tonight, not so much. Charged for everything extra without warning. Cheese, chips, salsa. Meat very over cooked. Hardly any meat whatsoever. So, meat should not be crunchy.   Staff should've explained that they charge for everything. I tried calling them for over an hour to get hours and it was a constant busy signal. I mentioned it to them and they acted like it was no big deal.   My wife wants to try it and I am going to tell her never again. She would not be impressed at all.   My recommendation is to go to another Mexican restaurant that has much better food. Taco Bell for instance. Jalapeno Inferno would be ten times better. Maybe even Blanco. If you want to try this place, wait till they close and something else opens in its place."}
{"text":"Margaritas are ok. Stay away from the food. It was pretty gross. Too bad, we were excited to give it a try."}
{"text":"Great tacos, great service, great atmosphere.  Probably my favorite tacos in the Scottsdale area.  I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The staff was cool the bar is cool the food is to be desired and for what you get pricey. I had more grease drip from two tacos than salsa in my salsa cup. I have never had such bad pastor tacos. Must have had a white guy cooking lol"}
{"text":"My family and I have had nothing but great food and great service here.  From the tacos to the margaritas.  Gilbert and Ron are 2 great servers.  We are patrons for life! The place is always clean and the staff always work as a team to get your food to you in a timely matter."}
{"text":"THE most amazing and authentic tacos in town!!! So sad about the less-than-stellar reviews from the people who want their asses kissed...takes away from the quality of this gem:/"}
{"text":"Salt & Lime is a cute place with surprisingly good food! I love that they give free chips and salsa and their salsa happens to be amazing. I had the regular margarita which was good though a bit too sweet for my taste. As an entree I had the chicken fajitas. These are super good and they provide free guacamole. The guacamole has mandarin oranges in it which is a little strange! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Food was good service was wonderful met the owner Jeff and his wife very nice gave us a free entree . Will go back again"}
{"text":"Cool vibe and nice seating options for indoor and out with heaters when needed.  Our server was the best ever giving us recommendations for everything and sporting a good sense of humor.  This could be a regular hang out for us!  We are not big eaters and ordered margaritas and an appetizer to share.  Whoa boy!  Good thing that's all we ordered for dinner because it was enough for 4 people!  We didn't even finish one app and it was really good.  It is their Totopos.  Never heard of it before, but he insisted we should try it over the traditional Nachos we were set to order.  Even suggested the Barbacoa as one of the choices for topping.  OMG!  Best Barbacoa I've ever had!  Melt in your mouth meat and super generous on the amount. Our other topping choice was the Chicken Tinga which might have been good but didn't stand a chance against the Barbacoa.  Sorry - I'm not a big meat eater these days, and this was really good!  Even though we could't finish even one appetizer, we went for dessert with an after dinner drink.  We had their Sopapilla's and they were very tasty."}
{"text":"I had the green chicken enchaladas.. my friend had the ahi tacos... I was very disappointed... Luke warm.. I think the tortillas weren't cooked.. green chili sauce tasted more like very green avocado dip... big price tag of $14 bucks... I should have sent it back...Ahi tacos were ok... but she didn't get any lime or sauce to go with them.. service ok... we wont be back"}
{"text":"I actually come here frequently. I love this place and the staff is excellent. You really get that authentic feel and would definitely recommend to anybody that wants to have a nice lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! First  Gilbert always goes out of his way to make sure your taken care of. Tonight while serving the owner he made sure to come say hi and take our drink order, then we had Rachel who  is equally as amazing!! The service keeps us coming back. Not to mention the amazing food and drinks!!"}
{"text":"I came in for happy hour to satisfy a margarita craving! I got the s&l margarita on the rocks, which their house margarita. It looked beautiful and was served in a nice glass, with a cool green salted rim. However, it tasted like it came from a premade mix and was too sweet. I would expect a fresh and balanced margarita for this type of restaurant (upscale Mexican) and price point. I then switched to the red sangria which was decent. For food, I order the mini chimis which were $2 off for happy hour. The chimis has an external texture more similar to an egg roll. The inside was overly moist and didn't have the typical chimichanga filling and taste. It was served on top of bed of lettuce, which had some pieces that looked not so fresh. It's rare for me to not leave a clean plate, but I could only eat about half of them before I gave up.   I ultimately gave this place 2 stars because the chips & salsa were great! The service was also good, but I would not come back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Came here on it's first day and, although it needs a few minor changes, it is my new favorite Mexican place! We are friends with the owners, and eat at their other restaurant, Stone and Vine, frequently. I recommend getting the huachinango taco, which was our favorite. DEFINITELY will return to enjoy the food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've always had a pleasant experience at Salt & Lime however after my experience last Friday I will not be returning. When I first arrived for happy hour at around 5:30 I was actually pretty impressed. My friend arrived around 6:00. Our waitress was attentive and the teamwork of the employees was impeccable. Our food was running behind however with how busy it was I completely understood and had no problem waiting. My friend and I received our food, Ate and ordered a few more drinks. All sounds great until around 7:30 when the MANAGER came and slid the table that was next to us into ours... she informed me she had a group of 6 people coming in and was just getting ready for the turn around. I still had half my drink left and let the manager know. She then exclaimed she \"wasn't trying to rush me out\" and then proceeded to say \"you paid right?\" And opened the check in front of me... (we had just paid maybe 5 min. Ago and as stated earlier I was finishing my drink. I understand if there was a big party that was waiting to be seated and had I just been asked, I would have happily moved to another table. However, our food was late and after a $75 bill i felt completely unvalued. I hope if you visit you are treated with more respect and value."}
{"text":"Our first time here. Shelly was an excellent server and the food was delicious! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very average food here, bland and just not overly tasty. I've had 3-4 of their different tacos, fajitas and my husband has had a burro (over 4 seperate visits because it's so close to our house) and we've felt all the dishes we have tried are just ok. My kids have never liked their meals there. The last time we ate there we all felt kind of sick when we got home. Bar drinks and margs are tasty and service has always been very nice and attentive but sadly the food is underwhelming. They would benefit from better recipes with a lot more flavor - even the salsa is just average. We actually much prefer Chipotle for better Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have been to Salt and Lime three times now and it's safe to say I will be back many more. Two of the times have been with my crazy toddler and everyone has been so great with her! They bring her drink and food quickly and help with anything she needs. The service has been excellent each time, everything comes out correctly and quickly. The food is awesome, and their happy hour specials are amazing! I have tried almost all their tacos and love the combinations! The braised short rib was my favorite, with The ahi tuna being a close second. I really enjoyed the pineapple salsa out of all of their salsa choices! So good, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about the food. Tamales are interesting as they are basically deep fried (almost cookie like) and served open face. Think unsweetened pie crust like taste.  Prob not the best idea. Tacos were avg at best and def overpriced for the portion. Chips and habanero salsa prob best bet"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Poor service.  As tourists, my wife and I visited Salt & Lime this past Sunday night. A string of happenstances seemed to be plaguing the staff and the kitchen, but the food we tried was terrific.   Unfortunately, I didn't get the impression that our server was all that on his game even on a good day. Word from surrounding tables (since our server never actually explained this) was that the kitchen got several large to-go orders, which was the reason our appetizers (yes, appetizers) took an hour to come out.   Not quite sure why our server disappeared and never returned until we were long finished with our first course. Never asked if we wanted to order anything else, brought refills, checked on us, etc. He was like a wisp of smoke.   When the food finally did arrive, it was fantastic. We tried the nachos and a chile relleno, and planned on ordering a few tacos. But the combination of the massive pile of food placed in front of us, and the long-wait time prevented us from continuing down the road to stuffed-pigsville.   In conclusion, I would definitely come back on another night, but hope beyond hope that we got a different server because all the others seemed to be handling the difficulties with much more ease...and much more presence than the dancing bearded hipsterry fellow who was assigned to take care of us...and didn't."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a delicious meal, great atmosphere, and excellent service this is the place!! My boyfriend and I came here for the first time and absolutely loved everything about our experience. We were immediately greeted by the friendly hostess and were seated in Candice's section. Candice was perfect!!! My boyfriend drinks water like a fish and she was able to keep up with him on the refills. She made great recommendations that we were not disappointed with. I totally recommend the shrimp tacos and steak fajitas. Then we topped off our meal with yummy sopapillas that you must try!! All around wonderful experience and  will definitely be coming back!  Thank you, Candice for your exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Food was horrible and enchilada cold ! Margarita was all Lime"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST salsa and chips. They come out fresh and you can almost eat two bowls before you get dinner because it's so good. My best friend and I ordered the Mexican salad with chicken. It was huge with small pieces of delicious avacodo on top. I highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Carry out order was literally tossed in the to go box, no sides as ordered with increased price for entree. Not happy and never going there again."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks. I recommend the quesadilla and the guacamole but I'm sure they have other great options that I have yet to try. Fun, friendly atmosphere and some unique tequila options."}
{"text":"This place is so chill. Love the patio, cute area of town.  The staff is hard working, polite and very attentive.  The food is so good. My favorite is the totoppos. The guacamole has lots of flavor, it's so good. Get a large because you will be scooping it and the small is never enough. The bartenders are seriously the best bartenders. They are fun sweet and make amazing drinks and my favorite the margarita with a red sangria float. I take everyone here from family to business and it becomes everyone's favorite place after the first time."}
{"text":"We visited on 1/29/15 for lunch. The location in a strip mall is never one of my favorites but I did like the cozy atmosphere of the restaurant. Smaller than I thought it would be  but glad it was.  I am in a wheelchair due to a hip surgery gone awry so the hostess (?) pulled the chair away so I could roll up to the table. Good service, friendly staff. We started with the Mini Enchiladas...tasty but a tad spicy for me. Hubby said the more he ate, the more he liked them. Chips and Salsa...salsa was really good...has a little heat and very flavorful. Had 3 Carne Asada street tacos w/Street Corn and Mango Jicama slaw. Carne Asada could have used a tad more seasoning...tasted kind of bland but I put some Pineapple Salsa on it...better. I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the Street Corn...perfect if you add a dash of salt. I could make a meal of that. Jicama Slaw was a nice, light touch...had Flan for dessert...fantastic! The caramel sauce was divine...nice and thick not watery like some flan. House Margarita was very good...light and refreshing! If you're looking for Tex-Mex food this is not for you..this is much fresher, tastier and more authentic than everything smothered in cheese...will definitely go back to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently vacationed in Scottsdale and ate at Salt + Lime 3 times in one week...that's how much we loved it!!! The food and atmosphere is awesome - the house margarita is amazing.  During our first visit we sat at the bar and asked Mike what he recommended - he said \"anything with the barbacoa.\" Kevin had a veggie burrito and added Baracoa. It was just as amazing as Mike promised. I had a chicken quesadilla which was also very good. We could tell right away that the food was scratch-made as it was fresh and \"clean\" tasting.  During our second visit, Kevin had the chicken tortilla soup and added Baracoa to it...yummy! I had a Baja (fish) taco. We also tried a variety of salsas - pico de gallo, pineapple and arbol. The pineapple one is unique and very flavorful! We finished dinner that evening with churros. OMG...definitely try these! You have a choice of 2 or 4 (2 was plenty for us) along with choices of dipping sauces; we had lime and chocolate.  We are so happy we tried Salt + Lime and look forward to our next visit. A BIG shout out to Sandra, Mike, Alec and Ron for providing us with great service!"}
{"text":"For a small taco joint, it doesn't get much better than Salt and Lime. Started off with some amazing, spicy chips/salsa, moved onto some guacamole, then ordered El Pastor, Carne Asada and Fish tacos...  Everything was amazing and the service was great.  A must!"}
{"text":"Found this place by chance and stopped in for lunch.  The chips and salsa were pretty good as were the lunch size crispy taquitos.  The service was decent and if I find myself in the area again I'd return."}
{"text":"Place is nice but the food is alright. Their Guacamole is the best. Didn't like my food I ordered the steak fajitas. Meat didn't taste good no seasoning has weird smell."}
{"text":"Every time I have been here service has been excellent...everyone is friendly and fast. I will continue to come back and bring friends....they have a variety of salsas and drinks to satisfy all pallets"}
{"text":"I have dined at Salt and Lime before, and I was very happy with the food, however it took a very long time despite the fact that it was not crowded at all. I went to get lunch with a friend who had not been there before, I recommended it. I got there at 2:45, but my friend got a little lost and took until 3 to get there. I when I went into the restaurant I noticed we had no lunch menus, and asked for them. My waiter told me they stopped serving lunch at 3. I told him at 3:05 that I wanted the \"Pollo Bowl,\" which is not much more than grilled chicken, beans and mild salsa. I came specifically for this dish that is not available on the dinner menu. My waiter told me he did not have any way to enter the order into his computer system. I understood this was something he couldn't do anything about and asked to speak to his manager. A blond haired woman came over and said that lunch is not available after 3 because the kitchen is not prepared to make lunch items anymore. I could understand that there could be a computer issue if lunch specials could not be entered after 3. This is something that a manager should be able to deal with.  The food in the kitchen does not dissipate between the time of 3 and 3:05 and there is no reason for the manager, who was a little bit rude, to tell me I cannot order something because I am 5 minutes past decided end time for lunch. I left and went to La Fonda Del Sol mexican food (less than 5 minutes down the street) where I ordered a lunch special, which was amazing and had phenomenal service."}
{"text":"The barbacoamobile basically has 2 gears - OK, and OMFG. The barbacoa here falls into the former category. Decent, but nothing in particular to set it apart. The pork belly taco was similarly flat, although the ingredients were clearly fresh. Nothing in terms of quantity or quality to justify the $5 per taco. I've had way better tacos for half the price, way better burritos for a dollar more.  Salsas get higher marks, if somewhat hit or miss. Tomatillo is a personal favorite of mine, and this place nails it. Perfect consistency, only slightly sweet. Salsa fresca is great as well. Big miss on the chile de arbol, their hottest. Decently hot, not particularly flavorful, the consistency of steak sauce.    Friendly service at the bar."}
{"text":"Loved the food, ambience, drinks and service. The staff was extremely friendly, the food was delicious and the prices are reasonable. I'll definitely be back! Great experience!"}
{"text":"If I could give it 5.5 stars out of 5, I would.   Okay, confession time. I work in the area and happened upon this gem completely by accident. Frantically driving through parking lots looking for something -- anything -- that wasn't fast food I figured Mexican would be great. It's hard to find a good Mexican place that has vegetarian food, so it's always a gamble for me.  But this one paid off and big. The food is delicious, the staff couldn't be friendlier, the prices are reasonable and if you can get there before noon the place can be all yours with no noisy neighbors sitting next to you.  I go here so often now that they don't even bring me a menu anymore; they know what I'm going to have. It's that good."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant. My husband and I have been here several times for happy hour and even brought family a few times to share the experience. The first time we went for happy hour, our waitress was extremely happy and helpful. When we asked about the drinks, she offered her favorites and discussed the different liquor \"floats\" we could add. I opted for the shop special which is the house margarita on the rocks. My husband went with the casarita which is the house margarita but frozen. We both tried blackberry as a float but my favorite is the prickly pear. Since then, these have pretty much our go to drinks.   As for appetizers, we have tried the guacamole, the chili relleno with shrimp, the nachos, and the quesadilla. The chili relleno is definitely our favorite as we've ordered it several times.  For entrees, I love the tacos. They have a wide variety and two are plenty (especially after some appetizers). My favorite tacos are the pork belly and the barbacoa. My husband has tried their green chili chicken enchiladas and their carne asada burrito. The burrito was delicious and he's ordered it a few times. But really, the tacos are the main attraction for us. For dessert, we've tried their churros once and my husband liked them, but I wasn't that keen on them.   Every time we've been the service has been quick and friendly. This is our go-to Mexican restaurant and I'd highly recommend stopping by and checking them out!"}
{"text":"I'm involved in an ALS clinical trial at The Mayo Clinic and this has become my favorite spot for a meal afterwards.  My family and I have been here at least 6 times. Good margaritas, great food, friendly and timely service and reasonable prices.  I highly recommend the Green Chili Chicken Enchiladas.  My favorite.  Oh ya, all of the tacos are yummy too."}
{"text":"Bland food, zero seasoning... Wait staff average to poor, won't be going back in a hurry, plus side nice location and generally nice restaurant."}
{"text":"We've become regulars and really enjoy the food and cocktails.  Chips and pineapple salsa? Delish.  Ditto for the kale salad and anything with pulled pork.  That margarita with the jalapeno?  I dream of it.  Gets pretty crowded (and loud) on the weekends.  If you can, I recommend going after a lunch rush, especially if it's your first time.    Service has been excellent every time we've dined here."}
{"text":"Omg what happened! This use to be my fave happy hour spot. Ugh. Who changed the margarita recipe! I came on a Friday it was crickets when usually they are packed. A waitress had their kid at the workplace yelling Mom, mom, mom, mom every 5 seconds. Buzz kill oh wait I didn't have a buzz because the margaritas were overly sweet syrupy diasters."}
{"text":"Great food. Super clean restaurant. Smiling helpful staff. Best guacamole ever. Great place to go."}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be great, but it was just OK. We were seated at a table without napkins and utensils. Why?? sit us at an empty table especially when the server took five minutes to recognize us as customers. When we asked for silverware and napkins, she said 'Wait a SEC!!\" Hey, we've been here five minutes before she came over.  My wife ordered the Carne Asada and I had the Carnitas Burrito. The server asked if we wanted the Slaw; hey wait a minute, it comes with the entree; we also chose the RED SAUCE; BIG mistake. The sauce was poured over and was BITTER. I had to scrap all the red sauce to the side of my plate. My wife also agreed that it wasn't good. Looking at the menu now, I don't remember if my burrito had the guacamole and pico de gallo in it. The carnitas, itself, was moist and  cooked just right. The Jicama Mango Slaw was very refreshing while eating the burrito.  The next time we try this restaurant I'm going to try their tacos and margarita. It looks like the name of the restaurant lives up to its billing, I just wish the burritos would have  been mucho better."}
{"text":"In the words of someone at my table...\"This is how a perfectly nice place goes out of business.\"  We popped in for a quick lunch and were greeted by the waitress who casually told us to sit anywhere. She was the only waitress working and apparently she was not interested in working.  After sitting there for about 20 minutes the bartender finally came over and took our order and dropped chips (no water, no drinks). We finally got water after another 15 minutes but our orange juices took even longer. We were literally there 45 minutes before our OJ hit the table. We were contemplating leaving just seconds before.  Bartender was a friendly gentleman but he was overwhelmed or not very organized... Or a little of both.  When the food came it was ok. Not memorable, just ok and not bad. We had the breakfast burrito which someone at our table said it tasted like Taco Bell but with more potatoes. Another guest said his tortilla egg thing was soggy like it was under heat lamps for a bit. In short, it was a train wreck. I even had to waive down someone to pay the bill.  I will not return and don't recommend anything about the place. Staff never smiled, ignored our table and wasn't doing a very good job with the other tables either. Especially considering the place only had like 5 tables (less than 1/4 full).  No heart, No passion."}
{"text":"This place used to be so good. They discontinued their hot salsa. They discontinued their great recipes. The waitress told us that it is because they are trying to accommodate all allergies and all sensitivities of people. Give me a break, you go out to eat to eat good food. My son has every allergy known to man and we figure out things that work on menus. We do not expect menus to accommodate everyone. It should be about good food and then everyone will come."}
{"text":"Arrived around 7:40pm. My friend had a table and was waiting for myself and another to arrive. She said no one came to her table for 10 minutes upon being seated. When I came I ordered a margarita and she ordered a beer. It took a little while for them to come. Our next friend showed up and the waiter never came by I had to flag him down. She ordered wine, and we ordered our food. This is about 8pm. The wine took 15 minutes to come. And at 8:35pm our food finally showed up. I was not impressed with the service here at all. Our server had come to check on us once in between us waiting for our food, because we had looks on our face like, what is taking so long? Although the food is good. The service was the worst. And I will not dine here again, and don't suggest anyone else do."}
{"text":"This situation really makes me mad!  I loved the food at Salt and Lime.  The carne asada fajitas were fantastic, so was my sangria.  All of our food was well worth the trip.  The problem was the service, it was ridiculously bad.  We waited 10 minutes to be greeted another 10 to get our drinks and a full 40 minutes from our drinks arriving until we received our food.  We had to ask our server where it was and he said it was on hold in the kitchen for some reason and that the manager would be over to talk with us.  He then returned 15 minutes later to tell us his manager didn't want to talk to us.  Sandra apparently didn't feel like we rated her time.  Whoever owns this place should fire any manager who refuses to speak to a customer for any reason.  We walked in the door at 5:04 and didn't get out until 6:40 and we didn't linger, that is simply how long it took.  We were never graced with Sandra's presence, instead the bar tender came over in her place and said this happens all the time.    To the owner, if you value your business hire a GM who cares about your customers.  We loved your food, but the service was terrible.  This is an easy fix if your management cared enough to try.    In the end, the bar tender bought us our second round of drinks per my suggestion.  I wanted to pay for the food since when it finally came it was great!  I actually had to explain how they should handle customer service.  Good luck if you keep Sandra, management trickles down."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch today, I get my nails done next door and decided to try this place out. There was no hostess at the door when we walked in so we waited a little only to sit ourselves and have menus given to us later. The waitress never mentioned when happy hour was and almost the whole menu is priced for happy hour. I asked for coffee and when the waitress brought it she spilled it all over my shoes and shirt!!! She never apologized so I thought it was rude. Other than that the food was ok. I had a chicken quesadilla."}
{"text":"6/4/15  Cute bar (with lime lighting on the underside of the counter).  Appreciated the purse hooks on the counter wall underneath, as well.  Nice patio seating and bar placement.  It's rare that I feel out of place dining at a restaurant; Although the clientele that day was a multi-generational mix, I felt that the restaurant is leaning towards a younger crowd with their young bartenders, servers, and manager-on-duty.    I ordered a Skinny B margarita (made with house tequila- Sauza Reposada?- fresh lime juice, and agave syrup) and the chicken enchiladas, subbing flour tortillas for the corn tacos, for happy hour ($2 off specific cocktails, beer, and wine specials, as well as appetizer and taco specials).  Complimentary chips and salsa fresca-- I was the first guest to ask for flour tortilla chips and try them here!  The chips and salsa were good, and so was the margarita.  I DID NOT care for the enchiladas at all; the green sauce (was that were all the spinach went?} was almost unpalatable.  Don't know why I ate as much as I did- around half of the two rolls.  Did not bother taking the rest home.  I also tried the bread pudding, which came with strawberries and a sweetened tequila sauce.  It wasn't anything special, but it was very warm and the sauce creamy, which is something I look for in a bread pudding. The dessert rang under $7 and was the largest serving I ordered at S&L.  I ate about 1/6 of the serving and took the rest home.  It's still sitting in the fridge, untouched.  Probably should just toss it away, as it's been four days...  Didn't feel well by the time I arrived home, and I went straight home and did not pass go.  It's not the first time I had half of a cocktail/glass of wine after getting a massage, but I'm sure it had to do with the combo of tequila and everything I ate; Possibly the green enchiladas and/or the tequila components of both the margarita and bread pudding, who knows?  Maybe I'll give Salt & Lime another go, but it won't be anytime soon."}
{"text":"First visit. Went with a girlfriend.  Everything looked great on the menu. Nothing looked boring and \"plain old mexican\" at all.  Their house salsa is SUPER yummo. Definitely homemade. Lots of fresh ingredients.  Serving sizes were too big, especially for lunch. It looks like they have the same menu for lunch and dinner (although I didn't ask). 3 enchiladas are too many at lunch time, because those chips are filling! So we split an order of the green chili enchiladas and (she had 2) I got a carne asada taco.  It was all delicious. Everything was fresh and yummy.  The food split was perfect, although I still ate too many chips. But that salsa was verry good!   Great attentive staff. Good food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service. They were very busy and poorly staffed. They don't seem efficient enough to handle a crowd. I have been there for lunch before and the service was better. Don't ever sit at the bar that requires a server. You won't get served. We literally watched 5 people sit and leave because they were neglected. Like I said the food is great. They just need to figure out how to run a restaurant efficiently."}
{"text":"This is my go to place in Scottsdale for a good Mexican food lunch.   The al la carte taco lunch is great."}
{"text":"Open faced tamales my dog didn't eat.  OMG.   Dry beyond belief and smelled odd.  Chips beans, and salsa good.  Food did not meet any of my expectations.  Eat at your own risk"}
{"text":"Everyone raves about salt and lime. I'm not everyone. I would say mediocre food, mediocre service and mediocre margaritas. The tacos are quite large though. I expected them to be Street taco sized and they weren't. Will I be back? Meh, I won't be suggesting the place so if my friends or family want to go and are set on it then I will go."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, average drinks and expensive.  They obviously pay for good reviews.   A group of loud, drunk, and obnoxious bikers were there, simply classless.  This is not a family establishment.  The good reviews are far from the reality, not to mention I saw employees handling the food without gloves, seems unclean.  This place is a complete disappointment."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Amazing tacos, margaritas, and happy hour. Great atmosphere - very chill, a bit local, and a fun spot. The patio is also very nice when it's cool enough.   Come for happy hour or for dinner. Definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night, were seated immediately.  It was pretty busy, there were never more than 2-3 tables empty.  The atmosphere:  Modern, industrial weathered decor, but the right touch of rustic.   Definitely going against the traditional mexi-rest decor.  Think of a mexican restaurant you might stumble upon in Fallout: New Vegas or Mad Max.  The pinatas and sombreros have been stripped away, all that's left is weathered metal, dark wood, and muted colors, modest lighting (which is the perfect accompaniment) and great food.  The restaurant does face west and they have an ample patio to enjoy views of the mountains and sunsets.  The service:  Attentive, friendly, not too talkative and prompt.  Michelle was our server near the bar and she efficiently took our orders, answered everything we asked.  When the food came out I was impressed that it was brought by 3 different people to make sure we were served efficiently.  Nice touch.  The menu:  Very creative.  Not over the top, plenty of standards but you can tell the kitchen took the time to consider and put their personal touch on each and every dish.  Since it was happy hour, we stuck mainly to the appetizers menu, but that was not a compromise.  More on food below.  The humble chicken quesadilla came with a delicious spicy avocado crema.    The drinks:  My only suggestions lie with the cocktails and the wines.  If they hired a mixology consultant or bartender as good as the chef, that would do it.  (I am available with a little notice.)  The drinks menu was adequate, but 4 reds and 4 whites (who's ordering all this red in a mexican restaurant?) and about 8 beers and 7-8 cocktails (4 of which sounded identical) was stingy at best.  Then there were like 30 tequilas.  OK, a little help here?  That said, my date's casa-rita was excellent and one was enough for her.  The wine pours were generous, at least 8-10 oz, which is good for the $6-10 glass prices.  The food:  The food was excellent.  Definitely the best for at least 15 miles, from the chips and salsa to the ceviche, to the jalapeños rellenos which i loved.  Probably the only place I've had better neo-Mex was in New York city.  The presentation was  creative, colorful, well garnished and arranged.  Everything came out sizzling and the server was very attentive, visiting us at twice during our appetizer course.  Clearing was efficient as well, and I really like the team approach of this wait staff vs. having to scan for your one server all evening.  I will definitely be back to try the crispy fried carnitas and the full relleno.  I loved that the jalapeños rellenos were not fried, just stuffed and broiled.  Frying is great, but it's nice to have an un-fried option once in a while.  The prices:  The prices were excellent for what you get, notably the specials.  Portions were very generous, so if something looked expensive, it is probably enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"Since a change of chefs here this place has really tasty food now.  My gosh, been multiple times lately and every time consistently exceptional tacos. Now our favorite."}
{"text":"Great location to go catch a quick game. They have great screens. Seating area is small.  They have a small patio. It can be a bit chili to seat outside right now. Sometimes the bar area is completely full. Parking can be a bit of an issue at this location. Arrive early or park in the back or to the side. I like the grilled chicken and carne asada tacos. They have the right combination of ingredients and taste. They have quite a variety of tacos. They do have a happy hour menu with the tacos. I like to order the regular size tacos as the HH ones tend to be small. Great chips and salsa. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I am giving Salt & Lime 3 stars because of the service.  It was great.  Our server was incredibly attentive and offered some great suggestions for our meals.  That being said, the remainder of our dining experience was significantly less impressive.  We received no free chips and salsa - not a huge deal but I thought it worth mentioning.  The food both looks and sounds impressive but it was incredibly bland.  I got the tamales and honestly, I have purchased more flavorful tamales from a gentleman selling them in the parking lot at Fry's.  Salt & Lime's tamales were also not very filling - I was hungry about an hour later.  My boyfriend got the crispy pork which was not crispy or seasoned in any way prior to cooking.  The street corn, however, was excellent and by far the best side dish that they had.  All in all, at $15-$17 a plate, it was not worth it if you are looking for flavorful Mexican food.  We more than likely will not be back, particularly with so many other, better options in the area."}
{"text":"My roommate and I went here for our monthly roomie dinner, because I drive past it everyday for work.    This is probably our favorite place we have gone to thus far, this year!  The food was fantastic! Our server was PHENOMENAL! I do not even like tequila, and he recommended something to try and I  even liked it!   Being able to order tacos a la carte is such a great way to try all the different ones! Pork belly is my favorite!   The atmosphere is really cool vibe as well!  Get a bunch of friends together and check it out!"}
{"text":"I am still a firm believer in service and the customer is always right if you want them to come back.  This was our first time trying this place.  My co-workers and I ordered lunch for take out today at 10:45 am.  15 min. Before they opened.  We place 4 orders.  All of which were lunch specials.  For some reason they charged one of us the entree price $14 vs. $9 for the lunch special also never asked if it was a lunch or entree order.   When we tried to explain how it was obviously for lunch the hostess (very nice and polite) took our issue to the manager who REFUSED to give is the lunch rate since the extra tamale had already been boxed up.  Completely illogical and unnecessary response.  We work for CVS and this is the closest take out to our Az head quarters.    Three of us really enjoyed our lunches (chicken mole bowls and the green chili enchiladas...the charro beans are ok). Our poor friend who paid $14 for a take out lunch was unimpressed as well she should be w/ $14 dry tamales with beans on top.  We will not be going back and will be sure to spread the word through CVS of this experience.  Take Away: you never know who you are serving, customer service is still important. It may impact your business 10 fold.  Disappointed and Irritated!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this restaurant for years as it could be relied upon for great service, cleanliness, and good food. Today, however, was a different story. We were seated at a table that was dirty/sticky. There were no place settings nor were any ever brought over. I finally had to get up and get them myself. The floors were filthy. While waiting for our order to be taken, I actually observed a server wiping all the leftover food at another table onto the floor. Speaking of waiting for our order, we waited about 30 min for our drink order to be delivered. We waited another 15 for our main meal to arrive. The salads were good -thus the two stars-but the service and cleanliness deserve a zero. It may be time to find a new Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, and good margaritas.  outdoor seating is available.  Must give this place a try."}
{"text":"Not the best, but definitely not the worst. For starters, anytime the word \"Modern\" is included title, it means, \"overpriced.\" The chips & salsa were ok. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd rate their salsa at a 6. Ordered 2 tacos for lunch; the Baja and the Pollo+Mole. The Baja lacked a lot of flavor, while the Pollo was, meh. I ended up asking for additional avocado crema for the Baja and it came well after the food had already gone cold.   Never been a fan of the À la carte taco menu (regardless of restaurant) and definitely less of a fan when they're flavorless and overpriced. Sure, the environment was cool; think low-key. Several patrons eating alone alongside several large groups. I visited over the lunch hour. A return seems likely since my co-workers love it. Maybe my experience next time will be different?"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and nice.  The place is incredibly loud. They have the music set where you are almost screaming to talk to people at your table.  The food falls way short in terms of flavor.  Everything needs some seasoning and the salsas they offer are less than satisfying.  The ceviche tastes similar to a watered down Bloody Mary with seafood in it.  They need to start over on the sauce on the chicken enchilada.  We took one bite and that was the end of that!  I know they are new, so hopefully it will get better.  It just seems like they have a long way to go.  I won't be returning for sometime, if ever."}
{"text":"Was so excited to visit this location as my mother in law and father in law wanted to introduce us to the restaurant but unfortunately, I was disappointed on my visit."}
{"text":"Love Salt and Lime. Food is amazing, atmosphere is fun, music is upbeat, great happy hour, and most of all service is fantastic.  Bartenders Chrissy and jake are fabulous. Chrissy made us the best margaritas and provided us great food recs.  Hands down best service in Scottsdale. Thank you guys always for delivering us such a good time."}
{"text":"Very very unfriendly bartenders!!! Ours was female, brunette, no name tag. Food is good but why the attitude??????"}
{"text":"While the restaurant was hopping and the drinks were good. I had a hard time getting behind their takes on traditional Mexican dishes. Perhaps its the difference in Arizona and Northern California preparations, but across the board they were not my style. I will say the portions were ample as we had take home quantities. My other issue was the noise level. Off the charts!"}
{"text":"Was extremely disappointed.   Came here after event with a group of 4 others.  Started with chips and salsa to share between 5 people.  They then told us that they would not refill our chips and salsa....and that they would need to charge us.    Next, we all ordered the combination fajitas per the waiter's recommendation, and were shocked at how little we had of any meat and of that, how overcooked and salty everything was.    We're all very disappointed in the quality of food we had for the money we spent, along with why Salt and Lime skimps on chips and salsa, especially in large groups.    I do not recommend that anyone return."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite Mexican food restaurant to date, I have had steak tacos black beans and rice 3 times now, best I've ever had other than in Saltio Mexico(50-100 miles south west of Mexico city) so good in fact that I haven't tried anything else...but my friend and oldest daughter have had the chicken tacos and pork tacos and said they were 100% top notch!! Employee's were all very polite, professional and clean. Restutaunt was clean as well, and the after food mints! Omg!! Must have!! A must eat at place if anywhere in a 20 mile radius."}
{"text":"Visited during that shoulder time of the day between lunch and happy hour.  Seated outside on a wonderful sunny day. Immediately given chips and salsa. Nice thick, rich salsa and not pico  de gallo like some restaurants serve. Ordered a carne asada burrito enchilada style.  Very tasty and huge. Great layering of flavors. Black beans were just how I would make them, so it's a winner too. So why only four stars? The food could have been warmer when served. I'd come back"}
{"text":"Have visited a couple of times and the food has really improved.  On our latest visit we had the Pollo en Mole taco and it was simply amazing, the Barbacoa taco was fantastic.  My husband had the Asada taco and said it would be one he would order again.  We had the habanero salsa, it was very good had lots of kick just the way we like it.  Salt and Lime will be a definite repeat."}
{"text":"The food and service are great and the churros keep us coming back for more!!! I really like this place a lot. Everyone is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Second time here and was a little disappointed.  My daughters carne asada burrito was delicious, and my wife's fajitas were good (they didn't mention there was an up charge for a combo of meats) but my other daughter and I had street tacos and they were not hot nor were the sides.  We would have sent them back, but our server never came back to check on us or our drinks.  Tried to flag down another, but they ignored us.  Won't return, too many other options in the area for Mexican."}
{"text":"I now can no longer eat guacamole without orange slices mixed in it!  Oh wait no.... that's not true but that is how Salt and Lime serves it. The queso fundido was a complete disaster. It came out bright yellow and looked and tasted like nacho cheese from a gas station.  If anything it was a fondue not a fundido.   The service was the best part of the meal. Everyone was very friendly and we got fast service. I felt like we were well attended for.   The burrito I didn't care for but my 8 year old liked it. The shrimp and carne asada fajitas saved the meal. They were very good. The vegetables tasted very fresh and the flour tortillas were excellent. The street corn side was also tasty.  All in all I wanted to give this place 2.5 stars but it wouldn't let me. It probably deserved 2 given the price but I couldn't bring myself to do i it."}
{"text":"Wow, sooo disappointed! Our first time here and the brunette waitress at the bar had no personality and was very unfriendly, obviously hasn't smiled in a very long time. Pretty sure it's the same one in the other reviews. We waited 45 minutes before anyone came back to see if we needed anything. Would of been great to have a couple more drinks and another appetizer but apparently we had our invisible attire on. We like to find places for work events etc...but will never come back again. Too bad, the atmosphere was great but the service is terrible and so is the bartenders attitude. Tried to contact the manager Sandra, had to leave a voicemail."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Solid nachos with lots of tasty ingredients and enough for 2 to share as a meal. But, why stop there?! The stuffed peppers were tasty and although I wanted to try more on the menu, we were too full to further partake."}
{"text":"I hate to do this!  I've had nice times here and the staff has been courteous and friendly.  But 3 times in a row now I've swung by for dinner over a half hour before their posted closing time and been greeted by a shrug and a \"sorry\".  Yep.  3 Times in a row they have determined that they are slower (on a weekend night) than the thought they'd be and are sweeping the floors.  Done.  \"Kitchen's closed.\"  I don't care if a place has 8pm as their closing time.  I will respect that and not go out of my way to drive there in order to arrive at 8:01.  That's fine.  You can be closed at any time that you want.  It's your business.  But when you are negligent and post a closing time with no intention on honoring it, shame on you.  The owners may not recognize that their staff is deciding to do this.  If so, now you know.  Closing time isn't an optional thing.  Yes, there have been 4am bars in small towns that will shut down at 2am if nobody is there.  But a restaurant that posts a reasonable closing time in Scottsdale and chooses to not honor it time after time after time, has no place in my rotation.  Thats no bueno.    Adios Salt and Lime."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for the first time.  We had a coupon for $5 off for spending $20 or more.  We both like Mexican food so we decided to give it a try.  I ordered the carnitas.  It was a bunch of pulled beef on a bed of green chili salsa with red onions on top.  It was overly salty to the extent that I couldn't eat it.  It was like eating beef where the only spice is salt.  My wife tried it and agreed.  Perhaps it's supposed to be very salty because the place is called \"Salt & Lime.\"  Anyway, I told the waiter and he said he'd tell the cook.  No offer to get me something else or anything.  When the meal was over, the waiter asked how it was and I said I can't eat it because it's overly salty.  At that point he said he'd take it off our bill and asked me if I wanted anything else to eat.  By that time I'd already filled up on the flour tortillas and chips.  So I declined.  Anyway, my wife had already finished eating at this point and it's not practical to wait for another meal when we're basically done.  She should have offered at the start of the meal.  The funny thing is that when we finished eating, my wife said her burrito (had shrimp in it) was also very salty.  Salt seems to be their seasoning of choice.  I would have rated the restaurant 1 star, but since they didn't make me pay for a lightly eaten salty carnitas, I've bumped it up to 2 stars.  There's no chance we'll ever come back here to eat again."}
{"text":"Had a great time tonight at Salt & Lime. Food was so good and the service was amazing. Joe was our server and was such a sweetheart! We brought our two little girls in with us. Our 1.5 year old wanted her own margarita, so Joe surprised her with a margarita glass full of lemonade. Love when people make your kids feel welcome too! We had guacamole, queso, salmon con tamale, carne asada fajitas and the kids chicken quesadilla. Everything was awesome. Definitely our New Mexican spot!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Been to this hot spot many times in which it is always packed! The crispy fish tacos are amazing especially with the corn! Stop in here for happy hour and enjoy a margarita!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. Service was absolutely terrible. It took almost 15 minutes to get a drink. Chips and salsa weren't offered until we were almost through our meal. Cross this one off the list."}
{"text":"First time here and as soon as we sat down I thought, I'm going to really like this place. Atmosphere was great and the menu had a bunch of choices. We came just for a quick trip for some drinks and an appetizer before we had to be somewhere. Got there at 4:40 and didn't leave till 5:30. This was not because we were having drinks on drinks, this was cause the service was very, very poor. We each only had two drinks and our appetizer was probably out 5 minutes after we ordered, but our server Ron was not good. I ordered my second drink ( which I had to ask the guy that brings the chips, to get) and watched  Ron go hangout behind the bar with the bartender for about 5 min. Finally another waitress brought my drink. It was the wrong drink. I had a few sips and kept telling my boyfriend that this is definitely not the one I ordered. The waitress was polite and came back a few minutes later and apologized that it was the wrong drink. So she took it and I thought I would be getting the correct one. Finally Ron comes over a minute later and says that the waitress should've just left the drink for me and he would've taken it off my bill, and that they do not have the stuff to make the drink I ordered off there menu. So I ordered a different one and then 3 minutes later we received it. Oh and during all this I asked for the bill when we ordered our second round, cause we were in a hurry and I basically had to wave it in his face in order for him to come pick it up. Would've figured after the 10 minutes waiting for another drink and them messing up, that they would've at least taken that off my bill, and they didn't of course. Needless to say, I liked this place from the start and could've seen it as a new hAngout, but probably never going back. Only gave it two stars cause I did like the appetizer and first drink I ordered."}
{"text":"Good spot with quality food and service. We are glad to have a solid Option like this one for quality Mexican food."}
{"text":"Salt & Lime has a modern decor with indoor and outdoor seating. The warm, thin tortilla chips (and salsa) taste fantastic with their ice cold margaritas, which are spot on!  I've been there several times, and the wait staff is always super friendly. The fajitas are wonderful, especially if you have a huge appetite.  They're also a fun entree to share, and they have ample amounts of toppings on the side. For a smaller appetite, the tacos can be ordered individually, and they are fresh, authentic, and fabulous!  I had the carne asada taco (pictured here), and the strips of steak were so tender and flavorful. To make it more of a meal, the waitress suggested a side of beans, and she was right; they were perfect together. Even though I was completely full, I still could've eaten another one of those tacos; they were THAT good.  I will definitely remember that the next time."}
{"text":"Excellent food and good service.  I've tried almost half the menu now and have not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Good happy hour. Our server was awesome. The salsa was tasty and so was the ceviche. I like thinner chips though. Maybe cuz I'm old and my teeth are sensitive :). But the chips were hard on my teeth lol. Oh, they have this tequila aged in whiskey barrel. Ask for it. Yum. Come early to get patio seating."}
{"text":"Great happy hour along with potent cocktails make Salt + Lime a go to destination. The food and drink menus are solid. The service is very attentive and courteous. The various tacos are to die for and are generously portioned."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars. The margaritas with a pomegranate floater was so delicious that I had to have another. I had the Mole tacos that are one of the best things I have ever tasted. The waitress was super helpful and friendly. I will be back for more. This place is tasty with a sexy ambiance.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Great experience!  Was greeted at the entrance by friendly staff and the women that took care of us was wonderful.  She made good recommendations and was always quick to take care of us.  We had the basic house margaritas ( Shop Special) and they were some of the best I have had in a long time.  My wife had the ahi taco and another type of fish and the were fantastic.  I had the Green Chili chicken enchiladas and it was very good.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"What a great fresh mex restaurant. This weekend they are having happy hour drinks and food all weekend long. I can't complain, food is not bland and not to spicy but just right, actually awesome and  the service was outstanding. Our server Kristy, was prompt. I never had to think twice about when my next cocktail was arriving. She was courteous and kind, as well as asking me what i needed before I could tell her. The entire staff, from hostess at the front door to the bussers were awesome as well as the service and attention we had from the owner. The ambience is an upscale casual vibe with 5 flat screen Tv's showing any sport of your choice. They have a variety of drinks to choose from, including margaritta drinks from frozen to iced. Great family place, date nite, to social gatherings. I can't wait to go back. Price is very fair and well worth it.   Davena"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Thoroughly enjoyed the totopos and salsa. The experience was disappointing due to waitress that was not attentive. She never turned on heat lamp after being asked and did not offer any refills."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional & very efficient. My 6 year old was served quickly and the guacamole was very good, and burritos were great as well. I'd recommend splitting the burritos though, because the portions are quite large."}
{"text":"We had an wonderful dinner here! Lettuce wrapped tacos were delicious and so nice that they have that available! The pork carnitas are fantastic! What really stood above it all was the margaritas! The absolute best margaritas I have ever had!! I guess they make them in a Bellini machine so they're super smooth and yummy! Cannot wait to go back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here at this establishment, it was very clean and organized the food came out in a timely manner, there was an issue with the meal they did not add carne asada as I asked, to my brunch special. We had arrived just after they opened on a sunday there was no rush or reason I think the waitress clearly forgot to add the steak to the meal when putting in the order. Overall the food was delicious I would definitely recommend salt and lime to all my friends."}
{"text":"Run away. Over priced and extremely mediocre food. I don't normally go to the trouble of leaving a review, but today's lunch experience was beyond awful.  - Service was extremely slow. - Orders were mixed up wrong. - Food was mediocre, specifically the Street Corn and Tacos.  The Street Corn should be renamed to Fecal Corn."}
{"text":"Went to this fab and fun place tonight. Ashley was our server and she was fantastic. We had margueritas, wine and Sangria with delicious chips and salsa. The entries were served hot and the servers hovered around to make sure everything was all right. We had enchiladas, fajitas with chicken and steak. I had a salad. The portion sizes are very generous. If Ashley could take care of us I would be there every night . My husbands favorite place to have an enchilada and marguerita."}
{"text":"Why so stingy with the chips and salsa?  If you don't ask for chips and salsa, they don't offer them  Weird.  Also, to the waitress who picked up my wine glass before I finished my wine...your tip was reduced.  A good server will know not to do that.  Also, the music is way too loud for a small restaurant."}
{"text":"Cool little Mexican spot right in a center with other nice bars and restaurants. Nice and cozy good drink specials and food and they have happy hour throughout the week."}
{"text":"The food was really good, especially there habanero salsa! The service was more than great! Everyone was friendly, smiling, and very attentive. The drinks were good, a little over priced but the atmosphere, the service, and flavorful Mexican food made it worth it. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere. Staff seems friendly; our waiter was attentive and warm. The guacamole appetizer was very flavorful and the orange added a nice and unique twist. The meat on the street tacos were dry but the specialty tacos were great. We had the shrimp taco and the braised beef taco. Both were amazing. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Not terrible Mexican food, but not terribly good either. I was excited to try their Mexican street corn (a favorite of mine!) but it tasted like it was microwaved, not grilled. The corn's cheese & spread were tasty, though. Street tacos were dry and lacking in flavor. Friendly service. If there weren't so many other delicious, more affordable Mexican restaurants in town, I'd say give 'em a go. But there are, so don't."}
{"text":"Excellent habanero salsa.  I've only experienced S&L for bar food and drinks.  Service was very polite.  Nice clean place."}
{"text":"Good solid Mexican food, at a decent price.  As the name implies, it may not be traditional but they put a nice modern twist on some classics.  The pork belly taco is very good, although I wish the meat was cut thicker.  Chicken mole taco, one of the best I've had...ended up ordering another one. Now the Taco al pastor...stay away! Much too sweet.  The tacos are not your typical street tacos, they are much larger.  The chips were fresh, and above average. I enjoyed the house salsa but if you want to add some kick get the habanero salsa.  House margaritas weren't overly sweet, and the servers were attentive.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Everything was really delicious, we order fajita tacos, mini chimichangas, the steak, and the enchiladas that my kids loved it! Nice environment."}
{"text":"When I saw the photos onine and the same price structure as Blanco, I was really hoping that I'd found another top-notch Mexican place in North Scottsdale.  Sadly, I was wrong.  The tacos were small and had little flavor.  The nachos had a cheez-whiz taste to them.  It seemed like they were using quality meat, but had no idea how to make it into a gourmet meal.  Basically, it's Garcia's with a better atmosphere.  Too bad it's not priced that way - I would have given it three stars."}
{"text":"Tried this place shortly after it opened. It's in a fun location and atmosphere. We had a great server and the food really was quite good. Serving tacos on the little holders is a great idea, keeps the mess down.  Nothing exactly bad to say, just a bit steep on the pricing for what you get. It's a good place to check out, but nothing really 'popped' for me--the \"modern Mexican cantina' theme is nice, but not fresh."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Service was very slow. To be fair there was a large group seated that seemed to affect things. But not my problem. Also, burritos were not great. Missing the guacamole and limited chicken. Would not go back again."}
{"text":"I have never had a less than great experience here and the food is very good. The fish, poultry, and beef and pork carnitas are unsurpassed.   This is a low-key destination where people come alone or meet friends for cocktails and appetizers or meals for conversation and fun.    I am not a pork lover (I don't get what anybody sees in a porkchop, for example) but their pork carnitas are the best anywhere. Right up there is the carne asada. Wood grilled, charcoal grilled maybe? I don't know but incredibly flavorful. Unlimited salsa and chips, great daily (weekend too) happy hour prices. I would feel comfortable coming here alone or with others. I see people who look comfortable doing either.  Chill place to go on a weekend late morning or afternoon, after work, too."}
