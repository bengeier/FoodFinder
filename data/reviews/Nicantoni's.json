{"text":"Woah! I was blown away on Saturday when I tried this stip mall pizza store, I loved the New York decorations, hard to find originality that they had, but look less at the store, bite into the pizza and you're buds will be forever changed, I'm not sure I could ever go into a Pizza Hut again, the quality was amazing! We had a large \"white\" pizza, which I normally hate, and a traditional pepperoni, wow was I surprised when I took that first bite into the white slice!  Amazing! Superb quality!  But they're homemade sauce was even better!  One of the best, if not, the best, pizzas I've eaten in my life.  The staff was friendly and were on top of their work! Thank you Tim and Anne for showing us this rare find!"}
{"text":"Great food and staff. Our group had mushroom and garlic knots for appetizers and Ravioli, Penne, and Calzones for entrees all of them were delicious."}
{"text":"We were just married and had Nicantoni's for our food choice. There isn't enough positive I can say! Vic was absolutely wonderful through the whole process. He was super honest and helpful when it came to our order. We had 100 guest at our wedding and I was ordering double the amount of food, instead of letting me order an excess he helped with pairing down the order. The food was astounding! All of our guests gobbled up the lasagna and sausage with peppers. I have never tasted better lasagna and my mouth is still watering when I talk about the sausage with peppers. I highly encourage anyone who needs to cater to call Vic and his crew!"}
{"text":"The first time I ate at Nicantoni's, I had the calzone, which was only so-so.  SInce this is our neighborhood pizza place, thought I'd give them a second chance.   Ordered the bruchezza pizza to go.  What a mistake!  It turned out to be a dry pizza crust, topped with ONLY peppers and about a half-ounce of unmelted mozzarella cheese---absolutely NOTHING else.  No sauce, no seasonings, nothing.  If i'd been eating on-site, I would have sent it back.  What a total waste of $15."}
{"text":"I have yet to try this place, the menu looks great! After reading the menu I had to laugh at all of the typos on the menu! Jalepeno, tomatoe, etc.
Hilarious!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ by a NYC mile! 

Love the pizza at ths place so much I even had my birthday party there. Simply outstanding.

Never had anything other than the pizza and a sausage sub here, also wings. I'd say the sandwiches are about average and the wings are really hit or miss.

Go here for the plain cheese
Pizza!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to try their food this weekend, and it was great. They had a young staff that seemed eager to serve us were very friendly. We had a salad pizza beer and ohh yes a canolli! The pizza was good did not care for the sausage Kinda bland. Everything else was above par! My husband liked the different draft beers that they had so we both went home happy. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"This is some good pizza.  We found this place by accident (i.e., searching the phone book because we didn't want to order from the Big 3 chains) a few years ago, and we've been fans ever since.  The sauce and crust are very good, as is the sausage, and the owners and staff are friendly.  They will do strange orders like 3/4 of a pie with one set of toppings and 1/4 of a pie with others - which is a plus given that there are very different sets of topping preferences in this house.

They have a deal where you get a token for every pizza, and if you collect 10, you get a free one.  We have gotten quite a few free pies.

Don't ever tell them that you put their leftover pizza in the microwave to heat it up.  They consider that sacrilege, and the owner went so far as to put a \"no microwaves\" drawing on one of our takeout boxes.  =)

The one criticism I have is that sometimes there's some inconsistency in how done the pizza is.  I don't think we've ever had one that wasn't cooked all the way, but every once in awhile we get one that's a little too crispy.  This is a minor gripe, though, and should not stop anyone from hitting this place up for some tasty pizza goodness."}
{"text":"Delicious Calzone, hot, great crust and creamy ricotta and delicious fresh sauce. Loved it, Loved the atmosphere and service was fantastic. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Food was just Ok.  Had a Groupon and was excited to try it based on the reviews here.  Nothing was bad, just not anything that great that would make me want to go back over many other pizza places in the area."}
{"text":"I was looking for a local favorite here in Gilbert and came upon Nicantoni's, from reading previous reviews I decided to try it tonight. We ordered a Sicilian pizza and it was very very delicious, however the service was absolutely horrible. Our waitress (thin, dark long hair) messed up on our order which we waited 25mins for and had to wait an additional 25mins to get it fixed. We did not receive a single apology for the mess up at all. So all in all the pizza was great but next time we will definitely do a pickup instead of a dine in."}
{"text":"What? No reviews yet? Can't believe it. Great pizza. Very cool staff (hot too). The owner always present, making sure the customers are happy. Love the tap beer choices. Good music - got turned on to old Fleetwood Mac blues - pre Buckingham-Nicks. Pure gold. No delivery but it's a really cool place to hang out in."}
{"text":"Best NY style pizze ever. The specials are great, we had the potato wrap shrimp skewers, awesome! If you love pizza you gotta go see Vic!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on July 8.  The place is located in a strip mall that has seen much better days.  The strip mall is fairly empty except for goodwill and a sushi place.  This place has been here for a very long time and I wish them continue success.  The food is good and is one of the few places that serves manhattan clam chowder which is the tomato base version of the boston clam chowder.  My soup was rather cold but I still enjoyed the flavor.  I ordered the 1/2 sub and soup special.  I ordered the Italian sub and was not disappointed.  The server was less then spectacular.  The lunch specials come with a drink  but I had to bring it to the server's attention to get mine.  We will be back and the food is pretty good.  Just wish the service would be better."}
{"text":"We travel to Arizona 2-3 times a year. We always go to Nicantoni's. They have terrific 
New York style pizza. Most everything on the menu is good but come for the pizza.
The staff & service is great and the prices are very reasonable.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service, casual cool atmosphere and great food! 

I came with a party of 7 including kids and we felt very comfortable and welcome, from the get go the waitress was super sweet and funny, she gave us suggestions on the menu and a little background about the place which made us feel like we were part of the family, it was nice, she did that with everybody.  Loved all the decor, by coincidence we went on 9/11 and sat at the 9/11 memorial table. They let their customers leave a mark on their walls, who couldn't love a place that lets you write on the walls? The owner was actually in the kitchen cooking and gave us a friendly wave when we left.  

Now about the food, we started with one of their huge Greek Salads which was really good, good portions of feta, olives and peppers. For dinner I couldn't decide between one of their dinners or pizza so I got both, don't judge me  =P  You can order a slice for just $2.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs which was good, not the best I've ever had but good, the portions were huge and it came with a good size side of garlic bread. I had a slice of their white pizza which I actually loved, they have awesome pizza that definitely compares to what I've had in New York. I tasted their eggplant parm and chicken parm off my family's plates and they were actually really really good, especially for the price and came with huge sides of spaghetti. I had a drink called a Nice based on our waitresses recommendation, it's an Italian Ice drink with vodka, creme and a flavored syrup, I picked orange. It was good, really strong, they didn't scrimp on the alcohol, I should add a fifth star for that alone =) They also serve wine and beer.

I can't decide which I love more,  the ambience, the waitress or the pizza... either way I will definitely be back for all =)"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a good pizza,  always called few minutes before go pick up my pizzas and they are always still super hot arrived at home ! I tried many different one and my favorite is the \" white pizza \" . The employees and the owner are really nice and frendly !"}
{"text":"I think we ordered the wrong food items. Meat and cheese board was on special and we soon learned why... meat going bad and cheese getting moldy. Pizza was OK but tastes like gas due to the type of grill they must be using. Not very appetizing. I like red sauce and the pizza I ordered was supposed to have red sauce per the server but it didn't. Again, dissapointed."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would.  I brought a pizza home and even my kids, who were hungry, didn't like it.  The grease was so thick on top of the pizza, the sauce was tasteless.  My neighbor stopped by and I offered him a slice. After he saw the name, he declined.  I''ve tried many AZ pizzas but this was the worst.  See my review for Salernos of Berwyn or Spinatos (worth the drive to Tempe)."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I'd like to give it 3.5 stars, but I'll round up.

We visited with a friend and his young daughter.  The little one ordered a salad (kids these days!  I didn't touch green leafy stuff till my 20s) and it looked so good that my hubs and I ordered one as well.  

We ordered cheese and pepperoni pizzas, and they were also good--not knock-your-socks-off spectacular, but decent in an innocuous, unremarkable kind of way.  Then again, that might've been due to the bland toppings we ordered.  It would've been fun to try something a little more creative; there were some truly inventive pizza combinations listed on the menu.  Some of them sounded so bizarre (sauerkraut on a pizza?!) that they must be really good...right?"}
{"text":"Just went for the first time. The apps and pizza are \"fantastic\"! Love the inside. Reminds me of a place back north, really nice and clean inside. This is a must try if you love . The owner...a super nice guy too. Looking forward to another visit...Soon!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!! My family and I eat there once a week. We love the cheese pizza with large Greek salad.  Staff is always so nice and kind and will go out of there way to make your pizza delicious. Thank you took a long time to find great pizza hear in valley, your a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I love the New York style pizza!  My fav is sausage, mushroom and onion and it's done perfectly!  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Much more than pizza and oh so good.  Large menu with big portions and great service!  You had a small calzone that was huge and very reasonably priced.  Will be back to check out the patio.  Saturday is being your puppy day and other days have other themes.  Have been back numerous times.  Great food and service.  Desserts are wonderful too!  Regular offerings plus a special tray of treats.  Just wonderful!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal tonight and our server Melissa did an incredible job for us. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My dad ordered the small calzone, but ended up with the large.  The large calzone is impressive.  My dad ate that thing without any help.  I am a little disappointed that he didn't receive a hat and a t-shirt for finishing it off.  I mean there's a ton of cheese in that thing....."}
{"text":"This is New York style pizza! The large pizza sure is large. Service was great and we can't wait to eat there again! Definitely a great value!"}
{"text":"What a find!  Been searching for a great east coast-style pizza since moving to the east valley in 2011 and we've found it in Nicantoni's.  Been past the place a thousand times but because the center is so dilapidated we've never felt compelled to go in.  Our BAD...this little pizzeria is truly authentic and amazing!  We loved the pizza and loved the sausage rolls,  Don't let the dreary exterior of the center fool you...this place is for real."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here! Great crispy crust and tons of cheese.  The garlic bread app is tasty and only $5.

Gotta get the canolis before they sell out, very authentic and they are my wife's favorite"}
{"text":"Simply outstanding. Great and quiet patio, great service. Best Bloody Mary  I have ever had. Food is fresh, tasty - can't fault it. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"One Nibble, everyone knows the laws, we try them all until we've had them all! I tried a large New York Style Cheese, A Sicilian Cheese, and the honey hot wings. All of them were good, I probably wouldn't order the Sicilian again (2.9), N.Y. Style Cheese which is the the staple for grading a New York style pizza (6.1). Again, everything was good but when you're judging pizza you have to be tough. 

Good food, would go back again."}
{"text":"We need to come here more often. I say that each time I go but somehow end up at Gilbert Pizza when the mood strikes. The thing that sets Nincantonis's apart is the fabulous super thin but crispy crust. A pizza is only as good as the gravy (sauce) and that too excels. I appreciate the sausage is the real deal and not frozen bullets like some pizza joints.

Yeah, we need to come here more often."}
{"text":"It figures it would take me 7 yrs before I go to the empty strip mall down the steet, right before I move out of the neighborhood to try this place.  

IT'S GOOD.  Got a red pizza with sausage with a great fennel taste and mushrooms.  The crust... geez, it's good.  Definitely better than Rosati's and a few others in the area..."}
{"text":"My family went to this place for my birthday dinner. The server was less than thrilled that we wanted to sit outside as she was the only person working, but she warmed up fast and we had a great experience. The food is absolutely delicious. I'm from NY and it had a great pizza place feel to it.  Just what I was hoping for. The place is really cute and has a great outdoor patio. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"4.5 stars, if that were an option...

Owner and staff are friendly, food is delicious, and portions are huge! 

Bonus: prices are cheap too. 

We'll for sure be going back!"}
{"text":"Started with garlic knots and portabella...so yummy!! Had the special beef stroganoff that was the best I have ever had!! You could really taate the Fresh pasta!! Finished with the lava cake...left soooOoo full but soooOo happy!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a long time! Crust was crispy and light! Tasty sauce, yummy pepperoni, and the perfect amount of cheese! Also tried the Gluten Free Pizza; so fricking good! I would have never known it was Gluten Free! Melissa was an awesome server! She was attentive and super funny! My kinda gal! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Arizona!!!! We love this place ever since a friend recommended it to us. Also they have great service!"}
{"text":"So, this time I understand the hype... 
I ordered the Tree Cheese pizza to go and called in early and they had it pipping hot at our arranged pick up time. 
The flavor of this pizza is outstanding. I think the best pizza here is just cheese and no other toppings. 
Get it!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza. Anytime we have friends over we either go to eat there or pick up from there. Try his subs as well as the pizza. All around great place for a casual night out. Keep up the genuine personality Victor."}
{"text":"Nicandtoni's is A-Ok in my book! You can actually get a slice of pizza all day long!!! The place is small and the closest I have seen to a regular pizza place, no flare, but good food and most of all, good pizza!!!! 

I give this place an A, the only reason I did not give it 5 starts is because I am from NJ and live in NYC for 4 years and to be honest, as good as it is, I still LOVE my east coast pizza! 

Good find, good price and most of all its a pizza joint where you can actually get SLICES that aren't $3.50 a piece!!!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place last week and I've been in three times so far.  Having just arrived from NYC, I was looking for decent slice and was sorely disappointed at other places with \"NY\" in the name.  The slices here are the closest to home that I've found.  I order them well-done so the crust is extra crispy.  On top of the great food and service, the happy hour features $ 2.00 Bud light so for $10.00 you get full and happy.  Try it."}
{"text":"This place was so great!! We had a table reserved and had a wonderful time. The pizza we ordered was amazing!! the waitresses were so sweet and the band was incredible! So talented!! MY NEW FAVORITE PLACE"}
{"text":"Tree Cheese Clam Sauce Pizza.

Haven't tried one of those yet?  Make today that day.

The pizza here is top notch.  I've tried about half the menu and I haven't yet encountered an item I didn't like.  They have real deal pizza.. they make it the way pizza is supposed to be made.  They have a proven method, which is evident by the consistency of the quality of their food.

I've gone to more expensive, fancier pizza places, and have discovered that a couple of those places here are \"hit or miss\".  At Nicantoni's, you  don't have to worry about that.  They hit the bullseye every time.

I recommend the Antipasto Salad.

They have these \"wings\" that are made of pork.  it's not on the online menu yet, but believe me, when the first person at our table took a bite of it, it damn near caused a feeding frenzy.  It's so tasty and tender.

The service is awesome.  The wait staff takes care of their business.

There's a vibrant and cool atmosphere at Nicantoni's.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Italian sub I've ever had. Hands down. Tip -- ask them to warm it up. 

My fiancé got pizza and also loved it. Their sausage was top-tier. 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this pizza! We always get the white pizza. My kids live this pizza & eating here. They have all written their name on the wall which us really cool. They will give you a marker so you can write whatever you want on the walls here. Usually It's your name & the sharpie is always a different color. If you haven't tried this place make it your next stop for lunch or dinner... you won't be dissapponted!"}
{"text":"The wife and I are big fans of the white pizza here. Quite simply the best around. You can't go wrong with the garlic knots, either. The service is always great, and the atmosphere/vibe are perfectly casual. Sometimes when they have live music inside it can be a little loud, but other than that, I think this spot is perfect."}
{"text":"I've had a few slices of Nicantoni's over the years and really liked it. However, this week was the first time I've ever eaten inside the restaurant.

I liked the neighborhood bar atmosphere. My husband was impressed with their liquor selection at the bar, and he enojyed a couple Peronis on draft.

The service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. We ordered a small pepperoni and a specialty pizza called a bruschezza which was described as a pizza with a bruschetta twist.

The pepperoni was very good per my meat-eating husband. Good crust, tasty sauce, similiar to my impression in the past.

The brushezza, however, completely missed the mark. It was executed very poorly. What I imagined the bruschezza to be is a regular cheese pizza topped with marinated tomatoes, oil, possibly balsamic, and basil after it was taken out of the oven. What we got was a crust that was blind-baked with bits of garlic. Then it was removed from the oven and topped with cold tomatoes seasoned with salt and pepper. That's it! My stomach sank when I saw the pizza. A side of marinara saved the pizza from being a total disaster.

We won't be coming back. I can make a better pizza at home."}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ. 
Great sauce and the crust was amazing.
Josh and Vic are very friendly and service was very good 

They have an amazing patio

They made my own creation the OMG pizza its onions mushrooms and fresh garlic. It was very good"}
{"text":"You want good pizza...go here.  It is the best.  Everything that I have ever eaten there is good.  The owner is a nice guy tool"}
{"text":"I had the chicken lettuce wrap and he had the meatball sub, both were awesome! 
Service was great!
The desert was to die for!!!"}
{"text":"All the way around a great place. The graffiti walls are super cool and so is the staff. Hands down the best New York slice around. The white pizza is perfection and so is the basic cheese. They offer a full bar and eat in or take out.

The owner is a super cool guy. I will most definitely be going back and trying the calzone next time."}
{"text":"This is the best and only place I get pizza! I brought my parents in while they were visiting from NJ and they were very impressed..said it tasted like back home. This is why I come here..and they are consistent. Fabulous pizza and many rave about the sausage rolls. Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food my only complaint will be the booths are very small.  If you have a medium sized belly it will be resting on the table."}
{"text":"I literally had Vic cater my wedding. He and his wife personally delivered. Pizza only. Everyone was stoked. Not one slice was left. 
He worries if he doesn't see our usual order on Friday and asks how I am if I order something different lol"}
{"text":"Well wife has the day off so me her and daughter just have to stop in for some awesome pizza"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Vic B for many many years. I love that are are gluten free options for pizza, etc.   This establishment is very relaxed and comfortable. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in the east valley! The patio is so cute and perfect for large parties! Super friendly wait staff! Great choice of desserts, the cannoli is to die for! The new location is in such a great area, in an adorable little plaza!"}
{"text":"Ask for the roast beef frizzle, it's absolutely delicious! Fresh made delicately fried onion rings. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Love the Stuffed Portabella Mushroom and Antipasto salad. Wish they had tiramisu though!
Our server Nicole was awesome and we enjoyed live music by SmootMahooty!  Hopefully they will be back sometime soon!
We will be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"Just moved to Gilbert and was looking for a great pizza place( non commercialized) and definitely found it.Great pizza , we picked up and can't wait to go and dine in as a family soon. Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"I'm from jersey and been out here for the last 10 years. The one thing I struggle with is finding good authentic food rather than chain restaurants. I have been on a journey to find great pizza and bagels that remind me of back home. Venezia's used to be my go to as it was the closest I could find to ny style. But then we tried Nicantoni's and haven't been back to Venezia's since. Nicantoni's reminds me of the family owned pizza joint in my hometown which I claim to have the best pizza. Now if I could only find a bagel joint that does the same I would be in heaven. My only suggestion for Nicantoni's would be to add a small 10 in gluten free pizza to their menu. My son is gluten sensitive and we have to buy frozen specialty pizzas from the store so he is not left out of our pizza Friday. Most pizza places (and restaurants in general) are staring to cater to gluten sensitivity.  I'm sure there are many more customers that would love to see a gluten free pie. Great job Nicantoni's!  You have restored my faith that it is possible to find good food from back east in AZ!!!"}
{"text":"Not a fan! 
I've ate here before but don't remember it being to bad so my boyfriend and I decided to try it again. But I was not pleased. We waited over 20 mins for our food. Which wasn't the best. I had the calzone and it was so hard and over cooked that I couldn't even finish it all. So I tried the pizza my boyfriend ordered and I've had better. The server was nice and checked on us often. Just wasn't happy with the food."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went there on Saturday for a late afternoon/early evening dinner.    The place is absolutely adorable, the servers were friendly, accomodating and very helpful.  Man, I thought what a great little place, so glad I bought this groupon!  Wasn't really in the mood for pizza, so I got a calzone with Ham, cheese, onions and tomatoes.  Megan got a meatball sub.  We both got salads that came with bread.  Salads were great, and we were off to a great start.  Then we received our food.  

Megan's sub was ok, but my calzone was just flat out nasty.  The crust was about an 1/8 of an inch thick and like overdone pie crust, hard and dark brown.  When I got it, while the waitress was standing there, I actually knocked on it and you could hear the knock and the crust didn't give at all, it was that overdone.  So I think to myself, I can't eat that sh__, I'll just eat the filling.  I don't know what kind of cheese was in there, but it was nasty too, way too many olives and onions and hardly any ham.  I kept trying to dig out something good, but there wasn't much in there.   So we paid, I took it home, ended up throwing it in the dumpster.  So off we went to the grocery store for a major grocery shopping trip.  I was using coupons, as I am attempting to save money like those extreme couponers,  and I'm not very good at it, so we were there for a while.  And what do you know, I start getting upset to my stomach and Megan is actually breaking out into a cold sweat and has to sit down halfway into our shop.   

The only reason I am giving this two stars is the service was so good.   Otherwise it would get one.  I would give the food a minus 3 if I could, it was that nasty.   Glad the pizza is good, according to the other reviews, but I won't be back.  Gross."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for some local neighborhood pizza. Score! Wings are baked not fried. Best wings in phoenix hands down! The flavor was phenomenal! We had the white pizza with olives and pepperoni, couldn't have made it better. It was delicious! You want amazing new york style cheesecake, this is the place! All around this food is blissful and affordable!"}
{"text":"Great place! A little cozy tucked away spot that may be hard to find, but well worth it.  Have been here twice this week because we want to taste everything! Eggplant Parmesan, chicken parmesan, American salad, capresse salad, cheesecake, canollis, and crumb cake all great!!!  Pizza is really good too! Just a suggestion..order extra cheese on Sicilian..perfect crust..HUGE pizza! Will be back. The service is perfect..best in the East Valley IMO."}
{"text":"Great, authentic NY style pizza joint tucked off the beaten path with a lovely outdoor patio that featured live music on a Friday evening at 6pm. My litmus test for authentic NY style pizza is simply one slice of cheese. I decided to venture off slightly from my norm and add some sliced jalepeno's to my slice and it was perfect! We also got the wings and they were average but still decent. I'm very particular about my wings and will request them extra done, light on the sauce with extra veggies next time. Overall a very pleasant experience with great food! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We dined on the patio (by choice. ) it was nice outside and what a Wonderful delightful night. Great pizza, and wonderful staff. We had an incredible server. (AJ) We were too full
For desert...And the deserts looked amazing!!!!! They have an awesome reward program.  The food came out quickly."}
{"text":"I love this pizza! Cool environment! Great location! I've been here a handful of times and have loved everything on the menu! Authentic grub!!!"}
{"text":"I loved this little pizza joint. The place is cozy (translation small) so you'll want to get there early enough to get a table. The service was beyond friendly - you can tell the server really loved the food there. When asked for recommendations she gushed over her personal favs. Someone came by and checked on us after we received our food a few times and all around it was a friendly atmosphere.

Now for the pizza - fabulous! The crust was thin (which we like) with a 
yeasty taste I love. It was the first time I ever ate the end pieces. My husband got a little marinara sauce for dipping his crust and enjoyed the flavor.
It's difficult to find a good pizza where they capture the right flavors for the sauce, the crust and the ingredients but Nicantoni's does this admirably. The sauce had a bit of tang in it so it didn't taste like an afterthought. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I got the traditional peperoni because the first time out I like to see if the joint gets the basics right before exploring the fancy stuff. However my husband being the more adventurous type got the white pizza. It's not a red sauce - more of a garlic butter base and my husband raved about it. He also got their fresh Italian sausage which was a delightful flavor that wasn't stringy or tough like some sausages can be. He also ordered a few other ingredients that were equally tasty. They use real mozzarella and all fresh ingredients.

I'm looking forward to going back and trying their pastas too. Lastly I was blown away by their prices. We occasionally visit another small non-chain restaurant in the area but the prices are so outrageous. But at Nicantoni's their prices were very reasonable. We have been looking for a quaint family-owned place for pizza and now we've found it!"}
{"text":"Great people great good, awesome family environment:)  I would definitely recommend. I am from new York and can say this is truly new York pizza."}
{"text":"This is the BEST pizza ever!!  I love coming here.  Everyone is so friendly and the service is so good!!  After having pizza here I never get pizza  anywhere else.  Id wait till I could have this yummy pizza!!"}
{"text":"BEST local beer taps in Chandler/Gilbert HANDS DOWN!!  Of course, awesome pizza and service.  A must try for any beer/pizza connoisseur."}
{"text":"Ambiance awesome.

Service good until it was time for the bill.  Bill came incorrect multiple times.  Had to leave before it got fixed.

Daughter did not like the manicotti at all.  Was handmade pasta and was a strange texture of light in middle and very dark and crispy on the edges.  The meatball was good.

Another person at our table had slices of pizza and that looked good.  The sausage looked good.

Great price on a bottle of beer for happy hour."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try Nicantoni's for awhile. We're glad we did :) the waitress was very kind and attentive and the owner was really cool. The wings weren't very hot (spice), but were delicious all the same. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"NY Style Pizza. Crust was really good... soft, chewy and crispy. Cheese had a good flavor and wasn't to greasy. The toppings of sausage, onion and peppers where plentiful. Almost too many onions but the flavor of the onions made it ok. The peppers were good (mixture of green and red) and the sausage was ok. It was very mild and missing the spicyness you normally get from a great pizza. Overall I like the pizza and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"If you are from New York and you want 1st class pizza and amazing service look no further than Nicantoni's pizza. I've be coming here for 25 years. The pizzas are 5 stars all the way. Desserts are amazing as well. The environment is very friendly and they make you feel like your at home in mamas kitchen. Beautiful patio area to enjoy some drinks and have some snacks. Victor the owner is a car and motorcycle nut so stop by for a slice and drink. You will not be disappointed and you will be hooked on it. As the sign says you don't like our pizza you can sleep with the fishes."}
{"text":"Great food, pizza is a must! Friendly service, nice environment with great outdoor patio. And a friendly and caring owner."}
{"text":"Great new location and the live music is such a bonus.
White pizza is a 10!!!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place a few months ago and we've been loving it! We're from NY and total pizza snobs so we're super picky about where we get our slabs. The dough and flavor is almost spot on to what we're used to. The sausage stuffed mushrooms are also pretty insane. Everything we've had there has been awesome and prices and service are great."}
{"text":"Great new location ... still the best NY style pizza in the East Valley.

Unfortunately my original review still stands ...  stay away from those chicken wings!"}
{"text":"I went to Nicantoni's because I wanted to try some local flavor... we did a *ahem* Citysearch for pizza and came across Nicantoni's.  Let me tell you... from first bite... I realized what a real pizza is supposed to be!  I have not gone back to the Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa Johns way of life.

Not sure if it's changed, but the one drawback was being closed on Sunday.  Yeah, I realize all those workers need a day off... but man, there are some Sundays I sit at home and WISH I had a Nic pizza.

Our order is always a large pepperoni, small cheese, and two cannoli.

Excellent service, super friendly, HIGHLY recommended!!"}
{"text":"Finally!  Great, foldable Jersey-style pizza in downtown Gillbert.  We had a beautiful garlicious white pizza, nice wine, zeppoles, and coffee for a very reasonable price.  Nice atmosphere and friendly service.  Vic Buono's pizza was a Godsend to this homesick Jersey boy 25 years ago, and that tradition continues at Nicantoni's.  Take it out if you must, but eat in to enjoy a relaxed slice of back east."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but I'll be damned if it isn't some of the best pizza in gilbert! Would have 5 stars if a two topping pizza was a little cheaper!"}
{"text":"Hello and thanks for taking the time to read. I know everyone has their own opinion regarding pizza, NY style or Chicago, but im not from either place so pizza in Arizona is all I know. (dont hate me) So I give this 3 out of 5 stars. The service was decent and place looked like an average pizza spot that serves beer but I thought for the money I paid for the pies was a tiny bit pricey. The pizza was good but once again for the money I paid, forgetaboutit! Would I come back, maybe?? The place has been around for quite some time which says something about it and thats definitely a good thing: ) 
Give it a try and you can form your own opinion. As for me, the search continues because I love pizza and can eat it everyday!: ) 
Bon Apetit"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm from NY which is the home of THE best pizza on the planet and I have to say I LOVE Nicantoni's pizza!! This is the closest to NY pizza I've come to in 10 years living  in AZ - my fave is the regular cheese pizza and also the cheese calzone is just heavenly !! The prices are great and even though the atmosphere reminds me of an old NYC night club that needs updating, I enjoy going there or taking it home - you gotta love it .......................'fuggetaboutit!"}
{"text":"As a former New Yorker, one of the things that I've missed the most is really good pizza. I found it here! I'll travel from anywhere in the greater Phoenix area for this special treat. The people are wonderful and friendly, the service is great and the food is outstanding. I highly recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"Server recommended the red clam pizza sauce for our pepperoni pizza. Surprisingly delicious; distinct without being overpowering. If I had only ordered the pizza, I would have gave 5 stars. Changed to 4 stars only because the antipasti ingredients did not feel very authentic or traditional. More of an Olive Garden Italian salad (or what I imagine Olive Garden sells as an Italian salad).

On every 4th Friday, they host a classic car meetup with the help of Cutthroat Customs. Get there earlier, though, most of the cars seemed to be cleared out by 8:30 PM.

Happy hour is from 2 to 6."}
{"text":"It's the best white pizza. Anywhere. My son claims the sub's are the best anywhere. The regular pizzas are great, but I stick with the white pizza with onions. The beer selection is solid."}
{"text":"Alright, let me begin this review by saying I really liked this restaurant. The people, the atmosphere, and of course the food were just fantastic. For the money I spent and the time I invested the experience was well worth it. If you are attempting to briefly decide whether or not to go to this establishment I suggest you give it a try. With that said let me go into some minor storytelling esque detail by explaining the circumstances of my visit. 

Me and my very close friend have been going to lunch on a regular basis to explore the various foods in the Gilbert Area. Less than a month ago the two of us visited the Liberty Market, a restaurant known for having good pizza. I ordered a White pizza at that location and thoroughly enjoyed it, however it took upwards of a half hour to receive it. At Nicantoni's Pizza Me and my friend both ordered the same pizza: a white pizza. The pizza was fantastic and it didn't take nearly as long to receive the order. The description on the menu for the White pizza stated that \"once you go white, you never go back\". Yes this made me and my pal laugh, but it also seemed strangely accurate. Eating other pizza doesn't feel as satisfying after eating such a fine example of the food. I really do need to re-visit this restaurant when I get the opportunity, I fear that my cravings will never subside if I don't. (perhaps this is the first step to a pizza addiction?) 

Yes I am exaggerating, but the experience I had at the restaurant was very satisfying. The only thing that I can think of that stuck out as unsatisfactory was the Chocolate Mousse I ate, but that was only because it wasn't very chilled, and thus a tad warm and strangely textured. It tasted delicious and the manner in which the server displayed the dessert was very appealing. A man with a large tray of chronic flavor-gasm inducing options did just what I like restaurants to do with their dessert items: He let the desserts speak for themselves. 

I will repeat what I stated at the start, I really liked this restaurant. The only reason I didn't give it a 5* rating is I don't believe maximum approval is possible in most circumstances. The restaurant would literally have to cater to me and my interests personally to receive a 5* rating. I don't expect that of any business."}
{"text":"Hidden gem, thank you everyone to show me this place. Julie our waitress was awesome, food was amazing, definitely coming back. Happy Hour is better than most places, keeping this place to myself"}
{"text":"Visited Nicantoni's for a Jeep meetup and we were greeted and seated a few minutes later. My boyfriend and I split the cheese and pepperoni pizza and our other friends had the lasagna and salads. We were given some bread and oil and vinegar to munch on while we waited for you food. The bread was so good. Soft on the inside and a nice crust on the outside. Very good! Our food came out about 10 minutes later and our pizza was sooooo good! The crust was perfect, the cheese was perfect, the pepperoni was perfect and so was the sauce....can you tell I enjoyed this pizza! Not too thick and not to thin and cooked perfectly!!!! I was one happy girl. Our friends really enjoyed the lasagna and salads and said they would certainly come back. 

Service was great and food was too. I will certainly be back for some pizza."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! Great food! Great service!! Possibly the best Bloody Mary I have ever had! It's a hidden gem with an awesome patio - just perfect for the lovely weather in AZ right now!"}
{"text":"I tried this place based on the reviews I read and I really liked it. Its was kinda busy but we were taken care of pretty quickly. We got the cheese sticks as an appetizer and they were the best that I have had. We ordered the Sicilian pizza not knowing that it was the size of a refridgerator. We could only eat like a pieces and a half each and we were full and had leftovers for 2 days and it was only like $14. This place is a deal and it is great pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tree Cheese pizza half with pepperoni /half sausage came out pipping hot to our table. The service very attentive and helpful.

So far I think it the best NY style pizza in AZ so far that I had. I least in the outlining areas. I have not been downtown yet."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic it's unfortunate the service was horrible. Afterwaiter finally made his way over. We asked about happy hour. His response you are not going to have time it ends in 10 minutes. We ordered a couple of beers, garlic knots and stuffed portobello mushrooms.  The knots were great, the stuffed portobello was amazing however it was not even 1/2 of an actual mushroom.  We ordered a pizza as well. The waiter disappeare and never came back. Our pizza was ready and had been sitting out 8-10 min before he brought it to us. We had to have them reheat the pizza as it was very cold. We heard the cooks yell at the waiter telling him if you would have picked up when it was ready.. He dropped off the hot pizza and before we could order another beer or water he left. The pizza was so fantastic. It's unfortunate that the service is horrible. A family sitting next to us waited at the table 10 min after being seated before they were helped, given water etc. we finished the 2 slices of pizza and still no waiter. We were thirsty but did not want to take the chance to order water as it would probably take another 30min. I had to stand up and ask the lady by the pizza oven putting the orders and pizza out if she could find our waiter or just bring us the check. I would recommend ordering the pizza for pick up and not eating at the restraunt.  The pizza and the food are fantastic worth ordering for pick up but not worth eating at the restraunt."}
{"text":"Nicantoni's wasn't bad.  But I wasn't blown away like most of the other reviewers.  I pass this place everyday on the way to pick up my son from La Petite Academy.  The wife and I decided to stop in here last Friday for a quick dinner.

The staff is really friendly.  Our waitress was an older lady, REALLY talkative and just like a gradma should be, talking about her grandbabies...  She was just sweet and very nice to my son... that's refreshing!  4 stars for service!

The Food:  We ordered Dom the spaghetti, Morgan had a slice of pizza and a greek salad.  I had the Ceasar salad.

The salads were good, tasty, nothing spectacular, but satisfying.  The spaghetti wasn't bad.. I'm really picky when it comes to spaghetti and this was pretty good.  

The pizza, was just eh... kinda greasy not a whole lot of flavor... but at the same time it wasnt horrible... and I have to say, by the time I tasted it it was cold, so to be fair I would have to go again and order it for myself... nice and hot to get the full effect.

Over-all not a bad place at all.  I wil have to go back for the great service and I'd like to try some more of the pasta dishes or the eggplant parm.

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went here to the new location on Gilbert road to try out the pizza. Excellent! Great service, great pizza and loved the atmosphere. Will be back! Next time will try a pasta dish"}
{"text":"We love Nicantoni's. The service is always great, the food is AMAZING and the owner is very nice..........we come all of the time!"}
{"text":"We ate here one afternoon for lunch with 3 hungry little kids with us. The service was efficient yet friendly. They helped keep the little ones from pouting with how the service was. And the food didn't take long to come and was very tasty ! I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great pizza and good service!  The \"Tre Cheese\" is great and has not changed since we started going here 8 years ago.  Highly recommend swinging by!"}
{"text":"Going back for the Italian desserts platter, good food service , drinks, bread served with dinner"}
{"text":"This place is always full and it's easy to see why: First, there is the atmosphere. Cozy, casual setting in The Islands, geared towards families and a younger crowd. Second, there is the service. Owner Vic Buono is well known among regulars, and he does his best to personally greet as many diners as possible. 

Oh, and then there is the food. The calzones are to die for, crispy on the outside, and full of oozing cheeses. The eggplant parmesean is also recommended, with tender frided eggplant in a rich homemade marinara sauce. Finish your meal off right with authentic Italian ice. Yum!"}
{"text":"Unique decor-reminds me of my fav place in FL, great customer service, loyal patronage, the kids can color all over the walls, nice draft and prices, great priced specials. Tonight we had the large cheese and small salad for $15. Token system for a free pizza. Buy 10, get one free. Loved everything except the ranch. I messaged the business to make a house ranch. If you're a ranch person, like myself, then you know how it can throw the pizza and salad off. My family considers this their new \"local pizza spot\"; I'll call ahead about that ranch, though."}
{"text":"Best pie in Gilbert period ! Vic is great, the place is awesome. Give it a try you will like it."}
{"text":"Always a solid choice for me when it comes to choosing a local pizza joint. I've been going here since I was in high school. I moved out of the area and stopped going, but then I had the opportunity to move right next to it! So when I'm in the mood, I'll walk over for a slice of pizza and a cold beer or 5. 

They have reasonable prices and the staff is always friendly. I would recommend giving the place a try!"}
{"text":"We got an order to go and the Pizza was amazing!!!!The Greek Salad had the best dressing I have ever had. It was smothered in fresh Feta cheese!!!! We got Cannoli's and they were so delicious too!!! When we walked in to pick up our order the place was decorated so quaint. We will definitely dine in next time!!! We can hardly wait to go back to the area just to eat there!!!"}
{"text":"OK, friends and neighbors! We have an Instant Karma Star Rating Upgrade for Nicantoni's. {please see Vic's comments below} Anytime an establishment reaches out with a plan to work with you... well it's just the Hallmark of stratospheric customer service. Big Thanks to Vic. His solution: Tell us you want the Roni's cut up and distributed on the Pizza. Brilliant!

Orig Review...

Got Door Dash delivery. Nicantoni's gets an extra star for outstanding achievements in:
--Sauce tastiness and consistency
--Cheese ratio and delectable gooeyness
--Dough texture and scrumptiocity (yup, had to create a whole new word to cover my sentiments there) 
--Being the best NY pizza alternative since Prima closed (RIP {tear falls}).

Very sadly though, Nicantoni's strays from perfection with the size of their pepperoni. These monsters are approx 2.5\" in diameter. I think we ALL know that pepperoni, like nipples, have an ideal max size. Lost your 5th star here guys. The sparse application of pepperoni further aggravates the situation. C'mon... there's stylistic difference that's good and sets you apart from... and above, the rest. And then there's stylistic difference that makes your clientele tilt their heads like the RCA dog and say: \"wow that pizza would have been better had they not done that.\" We're talkin' pizza here guys not Picasso. A couple eyes or noses placed asymmetrically on the side of a face might be interesting to look at. But applied to pizza? Such misguided artistry is a poor approach to pizza ingredient/cheese balance and homogeneity.

Lemme break it down in a less crassly-humorous and less pedantic fashion. The situation is this: when a person orders a pepperoni pizza, they expect a certain cheese to pepperoni ratio. There is an expectation that pepperoni will visit their taste buds about every other bite or so. A Nicantoni's pepperoni pizza can, and likely will, feature a single, lone third-of-a-piece of Roni off to the edge of a slice. So, the customer gnaws through 80-90% of that slice before EVER tasting pepperoni. Yeah, so thinking it through... your 4th star, the extra one, is in jeopardy. 

Was the pizza tasty? Oh yeah. Better than any other NY-Style around? Roger that. But the Pep thing is weird and not what I expect or enjoy in my pizza. Honesty, I would be tempted to order a plain cheese, take it home and add my own pepperoni. But then, I'm working too hard. Sigh.

Another southward contributor to the star rating is the subpar Wing game. 'Twas bad in both sauce and texture. A true low note in an otherwise splendid delivery experience. I acknowledge that delivery is not an optimal or fair wing evaluation method. Delivered wings tend to arrive less crispy for certain. However, sauce taste is unaffected by delivery... and it is this criterion I found unacceptably off-putting. Nicantoni's, please up your wing sauce game. Damn. Down to 3 Stars. Sorry guys. But it's all so recoverable. 

I'll give you guys another whirl in a month or two. 

Friends and neighbors, apologies for the anatomical reference above.  It's just too fitting to remove. And if we all loosen up just a bit, we can ALL certainly agree that nipple rule applies far more stringently to males. OK, perhaps that was too far. What can I say? I'm weak."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this awesome little pizza place when the wine bar next door wasn't open. It has a funky east coast vibe and it is a small place with some booths and a bar. Our server was very genuine and friendly. Started with some garlic bread and had a 14\" pizza with sausage and olives. It was more than enough for 2 people and everything tasted great. Can't wait to go back and try the clam pizza the server recommended."}
{"text":"As a New Jersey native, I can say that this has been the best pizza thus far that I have found in Arizona. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Visited tonight after catching the sandwich board on Gilbert Rd.  Good vibe when we walked in despite not being busy.  Caprese chicken sandwich was a bit bland and dry.  Hubs had the Italian combo and loved it.  Waitress was nice but busy with guests on the patio so we didn't see her much.  Daily specials sounded good, lobster Mac n cheese and something else, but we stuck with the menu.  Overall very good.  Well b back."}
{"text":"My husband and I get pizza from Nic's once a week. It is the kind of pizza that has a thinnish crust, you can properly hold, folded in one hand (NY style).  My husband thinks the wings are the best (i'm vegetarian so I cannot confirm nor deny, but they sure look good!).  The lady who owns/ runs it with her son are both so nice and seem like great people.  They are always very friendly and nice to us.  I recommend giving them a go!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza slices to go because we wanted something quick. We ordered 4 pizza slices, jalapeño poppers, a Greek salad and a mini cannoli plate. The pizza crust was hard and it was bland. The Greek salad was good, my husband thought the poppers were ok and the cannoli was just ok. If we went there again we would probably not order take out."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a pizza delivered a few days ago.  Worst pizza ever!  The meats were burnt and the peppers were raw.  We each choked down one piece because we were hungry, and then threw the rest in the garbage.  We might as well have just thrown our $40 in the trash and saved our taste buds from misery."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Gilbert need to visit great service all there food is great me to try pepperoni sausage mushrooms pizza"}
{"text":"Pizza is ok and the service is good, but the pizza price is deceiving, you order a pizza and the price is cheese only! The catch is!!!! When you order ingredients on the pizza, you add 12-14 bucks more to the price! Walked out of that place for a small pizza that was over 25 bucks!! Felt raped!!!"}
{"text":"Made our first visit over to their new location On 1 /7/17. We have eaten at the  previous 2 restaurants that were there so we are familiar with the spot. A perfect place for a little italian joint. It seems to be left as is with a few decorative items added to the wall.
A very friendly, inviting atmosphere to say the least. I ordered a slice of regular and a slice of sicilian pizza, garlic knots and my wife had the lasagne.
RC cola......old school !!

The garlic knots were very good  4.95 (8)

My wifes mafias kiss (amarreto sour) drink was good as well. 6.50

The lasagne was a standard tasting dish with no sides. 13.95

Unfortunately, the regular pizza slice was uninspiring....and gone in 3 bites. Very small old school slices. The sicilian square slice was more on point but just ok.

For desert, we had the spumoni waffle sandwich which was very good and enough to share. Recommended.

COREY was a very good server and definitley helped bring out the old school flavor of nickantonis. If you're from NY, NJ, chicago or boston....you'll feel it.

I'll have to find my sweetspot there because you can drop a 50 spot without blinking and we have found great, giant old school slices in Gilbert already at another place.
We will be back to nickantonis. A cool neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"I met some neighbors here for the first time. The pizza was so good. The crust was delicious. My first slice was plain white sauce pizza with no other toppings -- it was so good I ordered another to take home. My 2nd slice was red sauce with ham, pineapple, extra cheese and sliced tomatoes. I ended up taking that home too because they brought chicken wings out for happy hour and they were so good that I ended up eating 6 of them and couldn't finish my pizza. So both slices made for a great lunch the next day. The interior is funky but fun and the staff are very friendly. If you're in the area give it a try. I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"Best cannoli you will find anywhere!  Only thing is, when I ordered a slice, the toppings were just thrown on top VS. baked into the pizza which wasn't as appetizing as I had hoped for but, all in all good food, good atmosphere and good service!"}
{"text":"First timer...had Devin as our waitress....she was great.  great beer selection. Meal started with a great half loaf of fresh bread.  I had combo pizza, my girl had a eggplant parmesan sub, and our girl had Penne with red sauce.  The pizza was really good but the sub and Penne were just 3 star good.   the cannoli was 5 star - as good as you can get back in the old country (Newark). Had a great meal and recommend nicantonis to anyone wanting a good meal."}
{"text":"First time visit last Friday.  Had a groupon so thought we would give it a try.  Was pleasantly surprised!  Great food and service.  Had pizza, garlic knots, fried rice balls (not sure what they are actually called) and pizza with my family. Everything was amazing.  Definitely will go back, even without a groupon."}
{"text":"This place has great food! The pizza is awesome and lasagna is the best I have had. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Place was great! Food was served hot and fresh. Had a white pizza and it was soo good. Staff was awesome! You can even sign your name on the wall. I will be back.  Don't forget to order an Italian soda."}
{"text":"Won't be back. I enjoyed the first time, thought the place was different and cool. Our waitress we had the first two times was pretty cool and the food was good but after that the service and food just got worse. I gave it 4 tries because I like to support small businesses but sorry!!  My kids were with me every time and feel the same way. We aren't picky. The manager or owner doesn't like you to send food back. He seems very defensive. To me thats not good customer service."}
{"text":"Super slow night. Just got a pizza and wings. Pizza crust was a little burnt all across the bottom especially toward the middle.  Super crisp just needed to get it out of there a few minutes earlier. Wings were average with honey hot sauce that tasted bottled. Nice people."}
{"text":"Love love love the new location ! It's really nice . Patio area and indoor eating it's a step in the right direction ! If you haven't checked it out yet you have too !"}
{"text":"New location. Family  owned. Appealing warm family environment for dining inside as well as outside patio area.  Bar area nice for meeting up with friends for drinks and appetizers. Started with a local Arizonal beer brewed by San Tan brewery, called Devils' Brew and fried calamari.  For the main course I had the veal parmigiana with spaghetti with marinara sauce which was done nicely and very tasty. Also had pizza with sausage and bell peppers.  Live music on the patio every Thursday evening.  Food is New York Southern Italian style. Overall very good service and food was great."}
{"text":"We got a margherita pizza here and it was good.  I would definitely come back and try other options."}
{"text":"I just ordered a cheese pizza to go one Friday night. Absolutely delicious pizza! The crust is chewy and flavorful and the sauce was perfection. The place is really cool inside as well, I can't wait to get a group together to go over. I am such a pizza junkie so it's tough to please me but this place is top notch!"}
{"text":"Came here once in 2004.  I'd give it 5 stars based on the calzone alone!  It was my first time trying one of these, and Nicantoni's spinach calzone is still the best I've had (and I've tried quite a few.  If \"calzone\" is on a venue's menu, I usually order it just so that I can compare it to Nic's).  

The calzone measured roughly 8\"x5\"x5.\"  Yep, that's 5 inches flush on the table below your nose!  This baby was HUGE!  I like my calzones super-crusty on the outside and not too doughy on the inside.  Nope, it wasn't doughy at all.  For reference, Chandler's NYPD's calzone is my second favorite, but it doesn't even come close to the greatness of NIcantoni's calzone.  

I had to dock a star bec. I found a 2\"x2\" corner of a cardboard container- most likely that of a frozen spinach box.  Manager was kind enough to let me enjoy my original order and comp me a second one to take home.  Hey, it was cooked in a REALLY HOT oven, so germs on the cardboard were HARMLESS.  If the oven's temperature didn't cook them, the hydrochloric acid in my stomach would, eventually.

I have to go back and get my calzone fix.  Very soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Real NY Italian cuisine. I had the antipasto and eggplant.  Plenty to share.  Very friendly atmosphere. We celebrated my son's birthday there tonight. The cannoli is fabulous.  We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Nice little place with great service. Pizza was good. Will go down the menu and give it a go."}
{"text":"This review is one from my husband. He went the other night for a beer. Said he walked in and there were only a couple people in there, so we decided to sit at the bar. He ordered his drink and began chatting with the bartender. Before he knew it he was having a discussion with the owner. He was impressed with how nice all the employees were and that they do happy hour all day. We're having a date night next week with our other family friends and this is where well be going! So excited to be so close to such a great place. Good job with the basics guys. Some places forget about the customer seevice!"}
{"text":"Sorry, not a fan. 

The staff was inattentive and the food was just okay. We had the honey hot wings and small cheese pizza. It was good, but not great. 

No one greeted us when we arrived, so we stood around aimlessly until we decided to seat ourselves. My husband had to get up and ask for menus. The food took a little longer than I would have liked, and no one checked on us once we started eating. The check came at the end, but my husband had to walk up to the counter to pay."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. We ordered meatball sandwich, penne and a couple of desserts via #grubhub for pickup. We got there to pick it up & they claimed not to have received the order. We repeated the order in person and waited while they prepped it. We paid cash for the food at checkout. 
The food was so-so. Both of us got diarrhea right after eating and found out that even though they claim the #grubhub order hadn't been received the charge had been put through on the credit card. Had to call to have them refund the credit card, which they said they would. 
Finally, when I tried to phone them after their 11:00am open-time there was no answer."}
{"text":"Pizza was good just wish there crust was a little thinner and crisper would have been much better"}
{"text":"Ive been going here abour 10 years, returned tonight after too much time away. The service was great .... Friendly, casual, efficient. Bread with oil & vinegar was amazing. The greek salad was OK, not quite as good as I remember. But the white pizza made up for it. It is to die for, always has been. The other pizzas are great too ... Greasy, yes, and very flavorful. But the white pizza is sublime; crisp crust, melted cheese, a little oil, just an amazing pie.  Gotta get back here more often!"}
{"text":"First time at the new place. It was comfortable & the outside patio was awesome! The pizza was as fabulous as ever - but after seeing other people's orders - I'm going back & soon! Maybe on Friday for the fish Fry..."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Nicantoni's for awhile now and since they moved across the street from us it was the perfect time to check them out.  Only wish we had done it sooner!  We got pizza (me cheese and my husband gluten free pepperoni). My husband said the gluten free crust was nice and crispy.  The sauce was delicious and there was plenty of it.  Can't wait to go back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"Super impressed !!! We drove around last night trying to figure out where to eat and then remembered that Nicantonis had moved  up the road.  It was 9:15 when we arrived and were greeted  promptly and sat by our very friendly server  ( he told us his name , but I forgot it). We decided to have all appetizers.  Bacon wrapped jalapeño, calamari, prochuito wrapped asparagus, buffalo wings and stuffed mushrooms. We were impressed by all! Especially the bacon wrapped jalapeños ! They were baked , not fried.  Delicious food, warm welcoming atmosphere.  We will definitely be back !!"}
{"text":"This place is a GEM ! Never even heard of this place until a friend checked in here! We went in for lunch and they had some awesome specials! We were the only table in the place but they have a live bands certain nights of the week and it had some pretty cool decor ! I will be back with my family sooner rather than later! If you in downtown Gilbert this place is worth a try for sure !"}
{"text":"After 14 years we went for the first time Saturday for lunch  and to quickly sum it up we had no idea what we had been missing! 
We started with prosciutto wrapped asparagus with balsamic reduction(wow) then had a very good antipasto salad followed by the pizza.  The pizza had a perfect amount of toppings and cheese but the real star (for me) was the excellent sauce.  We finished with a piece  of pyramid cake (again wow!).
The service was perfect,  our waitress  (Julie)  sorry if I  got that wrong.  Anyway she was fantastic, very attentive without being bothersome she was also very knowledgeable about the menu and specials.
 It was so good we almost went back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Nicantoni's Pizza is amazing!  I am a huge fan of this place. I wish the owner had a son so I could marry him. 

They serve the best calzones ever and the pizza is great too.  If you go during lunch, they always have great specials going on and the service is fast...good for when you're on your lunch hour. 

It's also a good place to bring the kids.  The atmosphere is very casual and the noise level isn't kept to a minimum.  So your kids can be pretty loud and not get any of those 'looks' from other diners."}
{"text":"1/2 & 1/2 does not equal 2 at Nicantoni's Pizza.

We were looking for a local pizza place that had a larger menu with such things as Chicken Parm.  I went on Yelp and found Nicantoni's reasonably close.  

I saw that Aileen had reviewed it favorably so that carried some credibility.

We went and ate at the restaurant.  They have a funky atmosphere and friendly staff.  Working so far.

We shared a pie and my wife ordered the chicken parm.  It looked good and came with a nice side of spaghetti.  The pizza was tasty with a nice thin crust.  It was slightly soggy in the middle but in fairness we had lots of toppings.  

I appreciate that they charge appropriately for toppings.  So if you order 1/2 onion and the other 1/2 mushroom it counts as 1 topping not 2 as many pizza places charge.

They also carry limited beer and wine which is another plus."}
{"text":"First time here with some friends and we will be back. The chefs calamari dish is one of the best I have had, amazing! Pizza was great, fresh toppings and crisp crust! The patio is out back and is nice and quiet."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was welcoming and clean. We were greeted in s very friendly manner. We ordered to go the cheese ravioli, garlic knots and a large pizza. It was delicious. The crust was amazing!"}
{"text":"Hello again Az foodies.....

I hope you are enjoying this beautiful Arizona weather :)

In my quest to find good pizza in my area I decided that I will have to go beyond the places that deliver....which are few pickins....and go to an actual pizza place.

Nicantoni's is pretty close, so we stopped by and found the place to be small yet very cute.  

The girl who took our order was super friendly and the smells reminded me of those little N.Y pizza joynts.

I ordered a small (6 nice size slices) and made it a point to ask for \"EASY SAUCE\" and I also requested that they put the cheese all the way to the crust, so  we can enjoy the cheese  all the way down to the crust.

15 minutes later we picked up our pipping hot pizza and couldnt wait to experience what we hope would be a good pizza......

We opened the box and alas..... the cheese covered about 3/4 of the slices and the sauce was ample....now if you recall, I asked for EASY SAUCE.

Now, we enjoy a little grease on our pizza but when you pick up a slice and fold it over and the grease saturates an entire napkin(the thicker napkins, not the little one ply),,, I would have to say ..... thats just a wee bit too much grease!

The first 3 bites had nice flavor, then came that 4th bite and along with the bite what was left of the cheese.

That left a 1/4 of the slice, sitting there with all that sauce and  crust and NO toppings.

So, I tossed that and on to another slice....same thing, a few bites and thats it for the toppings.

Although I am from Chicago and enjoy pan pizza and the Chicago squares...I also visited N.Y often enough that I love their pizza as well.

Would I go back?  Probably not, but if I did I will make sure I tell them AGAIN exactly what I want and take my chances.

They do give you a token with each pizza and after 10 of them you get a free pizza, which is a nice gimick.....btw..... anyone out there want my token?  

I dont think we will be there enough to ever get our freebie.

So as I always say...well usually always....go...try...see what you think.

And until you do....

Bon Appetite'"}
{"text":"Second and last time. Got the same waitress. Don't know if it's her fault or the cooks fault but our pizza was screwed up.  The owner doesn't seem to care. We vacillated between Sal's Gilbert Pizza and Nicandtoni's and went here because of the full-service bar. We are so disappointed, we will not be back. We live in the neighborhood and have  hoped for years to find a place we could help out a local owner. We frequent some restaurants in downtown Gilbert and the service is outstanding. It's our thoughts that they realize they have a lot of competition and they have to go above and beyond.  And they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Great pizza, creative environment. Good  service overall. Truly massive portions. Would come in again!"}
{"text":"Always good pizza, fresh and crispy, quality cheese. Great east coast pizza that's hard to find in AZ.  Downfall, wish they made bigger pies!!!"}
{"text":"Yummmmyyy! The pizza is really really good. The crust is cooked perfectly and the sauce is really delicious and toppings were good. Finally I found a good pizza joint in east valley. I tried Oregano's pizza, Boston's, and others and none compare to this place. We also got the fried zucchini, which was not good and won't get it again. The breading was all soggy and mushy. We also got the caesar salad, which had the perfect dressing! The prices were so reasonable too....their small pizza is only $9 and it's the size of a large pizza from Papa John's. We left with 2 huge slices to take home. They also serve classic Italian pasta dishes like Chicken parmesan for $8 or spagetti and meatballs for $6!  We will definitely return to this pizza joint again and again."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch recently and it was pretty good. We were the only ones dining in so it was easy for our waitress to be attentive to us. She was very friendly. Service was good. Food came out timely. 
We started with ten chicken wings. 5 garlic parm and 5 honey hot. They were on the smaller side but packed a lot of flavor. Then we each got slices of pizza. One slice of NY style and husband for one NY and one Sicilian slice. The Sicilian was actually a thick crust deep dish pizza and I want to get that next time. Even the NY style was crunchy on the bottom. I like a good toasty pizza. Oh and I tried canollis, I know I spelled it wrong, for the first time and enjoyed them. Overall good food. Friendly service."}
{"text":"The food here is great. 

The staff is very friendly. We had a nice conversation with the owner and was happy to support this local business. 

We had the pizza and burger. Great choices!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to AZ 3years ago, I too did a frantic search for real pizza.  It took about 4 different pizza joints until I found Nicantoni's and I have never eaten anything since.  Honestly, eating pizza anywhere else is a complete waste of time..... this pizza is absolutely the best, hands down.

Ok, so it taste's great... how about everything else?  Well, it's prefect.  Great decor, friendly staff, and rock bottom prices.  My girl and I would get a large pepperoni pizza, side salad for 2, two drinks and walk out for under $25 with tip and have pizza leftover for 2 days.

The first time I was there the owner came over and chatted it up with us, asking how we found the place, where we were from, etc... very nice guy and made us feel very welcome.

Also, every 10th pizza is free!  They give you these poker chips for every pizza you buy, bring in 10 chips and get a free pizza.  Needless to say whenever friends were in town we'd go there and rack up the pizza chips.  :)

You MUST get a pepperoni pizza and an Italian soda.  I'm really not sure how their pepperoni tastes so good, but it's the best I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today with my supervisor and it was alright. The restaurant is decorated in an interesting way, with almost graffiti on the walls....it's pretty neat looking. They have good lunch specials, I had soup and a slice of pizza for 6.50. The minestrone soup was good, it had a lot of vegetables and was a good portion size. The pizza, in my opinion, was somewhat bland. I would come back here to get a lunch special again for convenience and price, but I wouldn't drive all the way out there on a special trip just to get their food."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza from here a couple months ago,  probably one of the best pizzas we've ever had.  (The best by far was on Bora Bora,  Tahiti, if you can believe it). Seriously,  my new favorite pizza. We went tonight for dinner,  because I wanted some good pasta, and we figured if the pizza was that good,  maybe the pasta was. WE WEREN'T LET DOWN! I had chicken parm,  my hubby had a calzone  (that was bigger than his head). So much food!  We both came home with enough for lunch tomorrow. Our server had only been on the job for 4 days,  and apologized, a lot, but there was no reason to. He did a great job. 
Our one regret,  not knowing it was bike night.....we could've ridden the bike to dinner. Other than that.....a great evening out for sure! 
Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Beautiful location with a romantic patio. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Service was ok. Owner did not seem to care we were unhappy with the screw up in the pizza order. The waitress was nice and attentive but she didn't make the mistake. Second time we gave them another try, but FAIL! My suggestion is you bend over backwards for your customers. We are the backbone of your business. We chose you tonight over Sal's since you had a full service bar! Not next time."}
{"text":"Meh, i like to give 4 stars to really good places and 5 stars for places that knock my socks off. I can't say either one here. If i were in my 20's again and unmarried and this place were a girl i met at a club i wouldn't kick it out of bed but for me this is nothing more than a one night stand. If you're like me and you're in an area you are unfamiliar with and you go on yelp to find a place to knock your socks off this is not the place. Try something else and hopefully you get lucky. If you're in a rush and just looking for something decent then this place will do. I will say i like the decor. It kind of looks like a tatoo shop. Oh, i had meatball sub and greek salad, meh."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I'm so excited to say this! BEST SICILIAN PIZZA I EVER TASTED!   This little Gilbert AZ. pizza place gets it righht evey time.  I did peperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms & onions.  You just have to try this place & this pizza.  YAY!!!!"}
{"text":"Such a good spot! Pizza is so flavorful and fresh. Service is friendly. Highly recommend over most pizza places in the area."}
{"text":"Nicatoni's is a phenomenal pizza joint that has the closest tasting pizza to the East Coast. The owner is always around and is one of the most friendly business owners I've ever met. My husband and I had pizza at our wedding and Nicatonis was so accommodating to our needs during the catering process. We got so many wonderful compliments about the food at our wedding. Not only do they excel at catering events, but they also make sure your ordinary dinner experience is the best it can be. They have a beautiful location right outside of downtown gilbert with a beautiful patio. This place is so amazing and the service is always incredible. We always recommend this place to anyone who is looking for some authentic and delicious Italian food."}
{"text":"I've eaten here dozens of times, the pizza is sooooooo good!! Definitely the best I've had in the E. Valley. It's really cheap too, and every time you buy a pizza they give you a Las Vegas style chip. After your 10th chip, you get a free pizza. WooHoo!!

The owner is always working. He's very nice and always busting ass in the open-air kitchen putting pizzas in. The servers are all very, very friendly & make you feel at home. They expanded the restaurant and started serving beer about a year and a half ago, so there's more than the 6 or so tables they used to have. 

The decor is funky and painted all sorts of crazy colors. One booth has a bunch of CD's under the glass. It's all very unique and funky. I just love it, am tickled by it, and take everyone I know here."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Great food and great service.  Highly recommend.   Great atmosphere .  Will recommend to friends for sure.  Great patio area."}
{"text":"Our new favorite pizza place! Pizza was crispy on bottom just the way I like it! Garlic knots were delicious & half of the cost goes toward breast cancer awareness! Service was exceptional! Cant wait for it to cool off to sit out on the patio. Definitely will be back to try other delicious dishes!"}
{"text":"I just returned from having dinner here and I would have to say, it was wonderful.  The service was great, the food was better than I imagined.  :)  We had pepperoni pizza, the large flavorful pepperonis and that soft hand tossed crust was truly amazing.  We also had lasagna and I am not a fan of all that ricotta cheese that some places over fill the lasagna with.....Nicatoni's was the best I have had so far, it wasn't loaded with the ricotta cheese.  The dessert tray looked amazing but I was way too full to even consider dessert."}
{"text":"First... the service here is great!  Hometown NY atmosphere, friendly staff.
But the food... just OK.  Our salads were.. just ok. We ordered two heros.  The chicken parm had generous portions, but the bread was old, kind of chewy like they microwaved it.
The eggplant parm was mushy and was on the same hero but this one was very hard and dry.  I actually pulled the eggplant out, tried to scoop out some soft bread inside and left the rest of the roll.  The pointed ends of my hero were so hard that I had trouble breaking them off."}
{"text":"Nice little pizza joint. Good pizza but only so so wine. Full bar so beer and mixed drinks available.  Don't go in with high expectations but enjoy the pizza and your company."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Went on a recommendation from a friend.  The decor is hip and funky if you're into that.  The food was great. Pizza reminded me of a good New York/New Jersey pizza.  The mac and cheese bites were awesome.  I had the stromboli.  This was an actual stomboli...there are some places out there that call a calzone a stromboli but this was legit.  Tasted great....Definitely will be back"}
