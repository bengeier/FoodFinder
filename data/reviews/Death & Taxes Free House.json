{"text":"We were here on a rainy Monday, killing a day in Toronto while waiting for a flight.  D&T is a joy -- a great pub with an early '70s vibe, great selection of craft beer, excellent food (chicken sandwich and mozzarella pizza) and superior service from a friendly waitress who was glad to recommend favorite foods and drink.  If we lived in he neighborhood, we would be regulars."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The vibe is good. The food is excellent, the cocktails are excellent and the beer choice is excellent. The three things that could improve are:  1. the music is way too loud!! Having to yell to talk to your friends in a bar/restaurant is very frustrating especially on a Sunday night... save it for Fridays and Saturdays if you must but the volume of the music doesn't make me want to stay and order more. The choice of music was great though!  2. The service was also a bit slow but it was Sunday after all.   3. I found the prices a bit steep on the food and drink menus."}
{"text":"This was my second visit. The first was the day after opening. No draft taps and limited food items but still great service and great food. Yesterday we tried the brunch menu. All three of us had different items. All three were amazing. Perfect size portions and again great service. Quickly becoming a regular go-to. Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Highlight: The beer selection has a decent variety of craft beer options including a few rotating taps and even some casks.   Lowlight: Food comes out as its ready. This means if you're eating as a group, you will not receive your food at the same time. You will probably not receive your appetizer dishes before your mains. You will just receive random food items ordered whenever they can bring it to you. While this part of the experience was a little annoying for those of us hungrily staring at other peoples plates of food, the food was fair for it's associated price.  Worth Mentioning: the serving staff are all super nice."}
{"text":"Had dinner and a few drinks here on a Saturday when everywhere was full. The food was surprisingly tasty but portions are too small and selection very limited. I sat on the patio which was cute. The service was OK. I'd give it higher ratings for more selection and bigger portions."}
{"text":"Death is definitely how I feel after I have to pay taxes to the IRS, so it was fitting to pay homage to this annual experience. I had a few drinks on a Tuesday evening and it was a great way to start my visit to Toronto (as I'm staying at The Drake Hotel).  The ambiance is definitely their strength as it's very welcoming and the decor is well executed. As many bars in the city, their bathrooms are downstairs but beware it is a tad chilly in the loo.  The two drinks I had were the Sazerac (one of the best I've had in a while) and a tequila based drink that I really enjoyed. It's a bummer I can't recall the exact name but it's a signature drink!  D&T features an outdoor patio and a full food menu.  Staff was very attentive and they had table service so we didn't have to continuously go up to the bar. Recommend this bar to anyone who is within the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Good little pub on Queen West. It's chill, got a nice vibe, good beer selection, and delicious food.  I had their special that day, which was a steak and stout soup. It was perfect for a cold, winter night. They did not skimp on the ingredients. It was hearty and full of flavour. The crostini served with the soup was also nicely toasted and buttered, a perfect complement to the soup. Would definitely come back again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I had dinner Thursday night at Death and Taxes during TIFF.   The patio was full, so we ate inside. We would've preferred the patio.   I love that they have Guinness on tap.  The Fried Chicken Bits were great! Although fried, they weren't greasy. They're a bit spicy - garnished with sautéed onions, red peppers and jalapeño.  The D & T Burger was good; we added a side of fries when we realized the burger didn't include a side. We ordered the Ham & Pineapple pizza. My friend liked it. Personally, I found the crust too thick and there were far too little toppings.   The DJ who was spinning on Thursday night was great!   We definitely liked the vibe and thought the food was reasonably priced given the ingredients and portions.  However, we were surprised by how slow the service was. The restaurant was overstaffed and with the exception of the full patio and a few people sitting at the bar, we were the only table inside. Staff were constantly walking by or hanging out talking by the bar and DJ stand or taking photos, but our table was pretty much ignored. We had to get the attention of staff every time we wanted to order a drink or food. My friend actually wanted more food, but given how long we had waited for service and that our friends were waiting for us at Barchef, he opted to just ask for the bill instead of ordering another pizza.   The brunch menu sounds great, so I'll return on a weekend for brunch...when I have lots of time!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here on a Saturday. Very quirky and art chic. Few vegetarian options for brunch eg. Avocado toast or eggs benedict with avacado."}
{"text":"So far I've only had drinks here but I've heard the menu is even better than Belfast Love Pub (I went there with a group of ppl and everyone was pleasantly surprised) Cool vibe, Queen West. The Staff is hilarious here!"}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance. I adore the charming little details and aesthetic of this place. The decor is gorgeous, mid century with modern accents. My server was very personable and friendly. She even offered a few personal recommendations from the menu. I had the avocado toast and a death in the afternoon cocktail. Both were done beautifully. I will definitely be back! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I had supper tonight at Death and Taxes ... it opened just two weeks ago.  I ordered a Crispy Chicken Sandwich (minus lettuce) and fries.  It was a good sandwich.  The chicken was tasty and the bun was warm and soft.  The fries were good too.  Ellis was my server and she took good care of me"}
{"text":"Love going here for brunch! I Forget my servers name but she was working on Saturday morning. I have had her twice and she is very nice and welcoming like all the staff. The menu is very reasonably priced compared to the Drake next door. the D&T Burger is definitely my favourite the bun is super soft and make sure you add a patty.  Starting to to make this place a weekly go to"}
{"text":"Came here for a few drinks over the weekend with some friends. The ambience of the place is cute and cozy with a ton of mid century details and decor. It is decorated in such a way that you wouldn't think that this bar is actually a chain. It has a . I sat out on the patio, which was also really nice.   My server was really personable and friendly. She gave me some recommendations for drinks as well as food on the menu. I had the cauliflower wings, which were super tasty I wish there had been more of them!   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Two things are certain, death and taxes.  Actually, three things are certain. Death, taxes and a morning headache following a night out on West Queen West with someone in their 20s. A (slightly more) youthful friend was visiting and we hit up a bunch of delicious bars.  This was my first time at D&T and I had a few gin cocktails and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Cute, dark French vibe, the food menu looks good and I will be back for brunch soon."}
