{"text":"This review will be updated as my concerns were addressed by the owner - - Only reason I came here was for the terrace and sunshine, hoping to enjoy a bite at the same time. Like many comments here (that I wish I had read before) it takes forever to get your food (around 1h for eggs Benedict's?!) the place wasn't even packed. The service?! Horrible. Noone will adress you unless you speak to them. Tables don't get cleared/cleaned unless you beg like 3 times. It's the first time in years I leave before getting my food. If you're hungry and on Crescent, go anywhere else but there."}
{"text":"Sitting outside on the balcony for brunch was fantastic. I had the smoked eggs Benedict with smoked salmon, hash brown, and fresh fruit and it was delicious. Visiting Montreal with a couple of my friends, we were all pretty hungry. The brunch special came with orange juice or mimosa, plus coffee or tea, and even more fresh fruit on the side. We were supposed to get this almond crepe as well, but I think our (super nice) waitress forgot them. However, we still left very happy and satisfied. Overall, I enjoyed the food, as well as environment, and wouldn't mind stopping by again next time I'm on Rue Crescent."}
{"text":"This place caught our eye because of the patios on the first and second floor that surround it. The food was amazing- we tried the gnocchi and it was melt in your mouth absolutely delicious and the lobster ravioli- also very good. Our server was okay- I think he was the manager.. Not overly friendly but alright. I give this place 4 stars because the sangria was pretty bad.. Did not taste like sangria at all (more like a Shirley Temple) and a glass of Pepsi (with no refills) was $5!!"}
{"text":"!!!! $7 for a tiny cappuccino!!!!!

AVOID THIS JOINT!!!!!

TOTAL ROBBERY!!!!!

I came early for the Rodin exhibition at the art gallery and no cafe opens before 10 am. I expected I might pay a little more than usual for. Cappuccino especially as this was small and Poe foam but $7 is more than double the normal price and I sat only 8 minutes 

They're taking advantage of clueless tourists and should be AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS."}
{"text":"Had drinks on the balcony during the afternoon. If you go here only order beer. Had two cocktails that I doubt had any booze in them."}
{"text":"The owner contacted me within 12 hours after our meal to apologize and I will be reevaluating this business soon. 
----
Epic fail. I don't know where to start on how terrible our experience was. We got there and when asking to be sat at the terrace, the waiter basically handed us our menus and asked us to go upstairs by ourselves. We sat down and another waiter came to take our brunch orders but didn't pick up the glasses and utensiles from the previous customers.

The table d'hote included fresh orange juice and coffee. The orange juice was probably dole, the coffee came after 30 minutes sitting and one reminder to the waiter and it was served with a tablespoon, the milk and sugar dropped on the table. After 45 minutes of waiting, no food had showed up and we started noticing other patrons were also struggling for service. We asked the waiter what was taking so long and he said he was sorry but they were very busy in the kitchen and it would be another 5 minutes. After 10 more minutes, i called the manager who listened, went in and then avoided my table. When our waiter returned empty handed, i told him we wanted to cancel our orders since it was an hour waiting and he just let us leave with an distraught look. 

Very bad experience."}
{"text":"Corso has replaced Pino and gone through renovations. I like the new look since it's more modern with a nice open space once you walk up the stairs. This is an Italian restaurant. I got a good spot on the terasse with friends, we enjoyed a nice view for people watching. The terasse was always full of customers but the inside was not. Not impressed with the service we received since our waiter never brought bread while we waited or refilled waters without us asking. My glass was dirty on the inside with traces of food. The calimari appetizer was a good sized portion shared by 3 people. It came with marinara and aoli dipping sauce. My salmon tartar was presented nicely, although lacked some flavor. The quail eggs were a nice touch which made it unique. I would give this place another try and order the pizza or pasta next time."}
{"text":"I ate here on a visit to Montreal. It was in a Tuesday night and they had specials on wines and pasta. It was delicious and a good value. The restaurant turns into a club after hours."}
{"text":"Walked back and forth on the strip, not sure where we should go for food and drinks after a long road trip.
Then we found this place which has a nice outdoor seating and perfect for people watching. 
Service was amazing and their pre-set dinner menu is well worth the money."}
{"text":"Wow, where do I begin. Service was terrible, took us forever to get our food, to ask for our check, and to pay our bill. Other tables walked out because 20 minutes went by and they still didn't have water. Another table walked out without paying their bill (according to our waiter) because no one was coming to their table. Our waiter told us they were very busy, but the place was not that busy at all. There were a good number of empty tables. 

Our server also seemed to be paying a lot of attention to the other side of the restaurant, and completely neglecting the section we were in. When we left, there were 2 tables next to us that we're growing angry because they weren't seen by anybody yet and didn't even have any water. 

Now on to the food - when my food finally arrived, it was lukewarm. I got pasta with shrimp, tomatoes and avocado - the avocado was BROWN and the shrimp was way over cooked. I literally had to use a knife to cut through the shrimp. I didn't bother to touch the avocado. Portions were also very small for the price - we ate our food in less than 10 minutes but somehow were there for an hour and a half because of the horrible service! Our waiter kept disappearing to the other side of the restaurant so we couldn't even flag him down.

While we were eating, someone came and cleaned the table next to us - and carelessly sprayed cleaning solution in the direction of our table. The tables were very close together so that could've easily gotten on my food. I then had a strong smell of cleaning solution as I was trying to eat my pasta. There could've been a better way to manage this - he could've turned away from us and sprayed it on his rag and then cleaned the table, minimizing the disturbance to us.

When we were finally able to ask for the check, we had our card out and ready but our waiter didn't even look at us, just handed us the bill and disappeared again. We tried to pay our bill at the bar and the bartender said no. At this point, I didn't blame the other table for walking out.

I would never come back here - way overpriced, bad food, and even worse service."}
{"text":"We went here on Museum day.   After walking for hours we were starving.  We stumbled on Corso.  The place looks nice but the food is sub par.  I ordered a chicken pesto pizza. There was hardly any pesto on the pizza and the chicken had a burnt grill taste.   Very disappointing.   My husband ordered lobster ravioli.  It tasted like cannes or frozen ravioli.  Again disappointing.  The only thing I enjoyed was the calamari and water."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 0 stars. Worst service I've ever experienced, actually all of the other tables complained as well. There were about 5 people working there and none of them were really doing anything.  I ordered the brunch and never received the crepe I was supposed to get.  We never got our water refilled.  We finally got our check about 30 minutes after we asked for it.  Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Worst service and food.
We stumbled upon this place which looked adorable.  Unfortunately that's the only good thing I could say about it.  It took 15 minutes to get menus, 30 minutes to get water.  Our order was wrong and there was a dead bug on our food which the manager claimed must have just flew on it.

We actually got up and left.

Stay away.  Total tourist trap."}
{"text":"The service was good but the appetizer they brought out which was the octopus was very rubbery. I have never tasted an octopus so rubbery in my life. Actually yes I have back in 2008 at Plum cafe in NYC which is now closed. The main course was delicious which was the chicken but it was drenched in mustard sauce which took away from the chicken itself but still good nonetheless. The vibe is very good as it feels like you are in a lounge and restaurant and club at the same time with very good music. The view is very nice since it's right on rue crescent."}
{"text":"The food was great however the waitress insisted we leave a 15% tip and we thought we ordered the $21 bottle of wine and when we got the bill it was almost a $60 bottle! Yikes!!! Such a large difference from red to white. (Hence the hesitance on leaving a 15% tip)"}
{"text":"Really quite bad on service. Salad had rotten lettuce all over and some mold. No water offered until asked when it's 85 out. 5 people working with 8 tables yet It took more than 15 min to order. The server didn't even take away salad plates before bringing entree. 

The entrees, fisherman's stew and pizza with clams were pretty good  but the mussels were cooked to dried and shrunken. However the broth was great. 

Over all, it was a very disappointing lunch and one of the worst service in Montreal."}
{"text":"The only thing paralleled to the amazing view on the top level patio is the food. We ordered the calamari which was perfectly crispy and not at all chewy and rubbery. Next we had the avenue crescent pizza and it was UNREAL! The ingredients were so fresh and it was perfectly cheesy and flavourful but the furthest thing from greasy. Would go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Corso 1471 was pretty good. My husband and I had the chance to try them 2 months ago while visiting Montreal for my birthday. We happened to just be walking around and came upon it and decided to try it. The staff greeted us and sat us at our table. The waiter was tentative and nice. 

Our waiter brought out bread and an Olive Oil & Balsamic Vinegar mix. The bread was good and I love the Olive Oil & Vinegar mix. We were first introduced to it in Italy when we went for our honeymoon. After the bread was brought out we ordered appetizers. We split a Caesar salad and ordered Fried Calamari. The Calamari was served with a Marinara sauce and an Aioli. The Fried Calamari and the bread were very good. After our appetizers and bread, we ordered our meals. I ordered the Roasted Salmon and my husband ordered a Pizza. The Roasted Salmon was soooo good. It was nice and tender and flavorful. I ordered mine to be cooked all the way through. I don't like the texture of the fleshy pinkness in the middle when it's only cooked med-rare. It was served with Lime and Mascarpone Risotto, Grilled Asparagus, & Reggiano Emulsion. The risotto and the veggies were also very good! The veggies were cooked perfect, not to crunchy but the perfect tenderness. The emulsion was the perfect sauce. It also had a few carrots in it. Everything in this dish just went together soooo well to create the perfect dish. Very good! My husband ordered a pizza with onions, peppers and sausage on it. It was also very good. He liked it and had no complaints. I also tried it and thought the same. 

Overall, my husband and I enjoyed our experience at Corso 1471. I enjoyed it so much that one night we didn't feel like going out so I ordered it to our hotel. They definitely have good food, and I would recommend them to others."}
{"text":"We Love the terrace a lot especially when you just finish your day and you feel like to have a drink. Good service And they have a good wine list"}
{"text":"In true tourist fashion, my friend and I set out late morning on a Sunday in search of food and quickly found Corso 1471. We were immediately sold by the brunch option: mimosa or juice, fruit salad or something else (we both got the fruit salad), a breakfast-style entree, a honey & something crepe, and coffee or tea (turned out to be bottomless!).

All in all, we weren't disappointed. My savory crepe with asparagus, ham and cheese was straightforward but definitely saved by the flavorful cheese. The fruit salad came with a yummy vanilla creme that was to die for and the coffee being bottomless was a major plus. Side note: as a heavy cream aficionado, I was so happy that restaurants in Montreal provided cream options vs. solely half & half at the table! 

Since the food was good but not great, the service was friendly, we were sat quickly and the decor was nice, I would have been content to give 4 stars; however, our sweet crepe never came. And never came. And never came. So after a couple updates from our waitress, we agreed that we didn't want to wait any longer than the 30 minutes we already had for a crepe neither of us was hungry for. The waitress was apologetic, and while the price was still decent for what we got, it was disappointing to pay full price for a meal we only got parts of."}
{"text":"Mauvais   service      car  le  serveur  était  visiblement   endormi.  on lui  demande  notre  commande  il prend  son  temps  . quand  la  reçoit  enfin   c'est  petit  et  le temps  délais  ne  valais pas  la peine  . C'était  froid en  plus    . Quand je  lui  demande  la  facture  il  s'arrange pour  essayer  d'avoir  plus  que  le pouboire .   Quant  à  l'alcool   pas   assez  alcoolisé.   Des   fois  la    nourriture   peut   être  mauvaise  mais  l'alcool mieux  J'ai  demandé   que  ce  soit  rectifié .  Imbuvable  !!!!  Trop   cher  pour     ce que  j'avais  pris  .  C'est  ma  dernière  fois  dans  cet  endroit !!!!! X("}
{"text":"My first night in Montreal and this is exactly what I was hoping for! The perfect mix of historic architecture blended with contemporary design. We sat on the second floor balcony, lined with fresh flowers on the railings, and a nice street view. All the servers were friendly attractive women. Impressive wine list. I had a nice glass of Sangiovese and we split a pizza that was fantastic- I would definitely recommend it - 
BIANCA, ROSSA E VERDE

FRESH GARLIC, MOZZARELLA, SPINACH, ROASTED TOMATOES, RICOTTA, EVOO

We finished with the crème brûlée. Also a good choice."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to go to Corso for dinner after work on Tuesday. As I waited to be greeted by the hostess, 2 groups who came in after me were being greeted and seated. After a good 2 minutes of being ignored, I politely tell her that I have been waiting to be seated. She didn't apologize. She gave extra menus to her colleague, who was already seating a group upstairs on the terrace, and told me to follow. I followed the hostess and waited awkwardly around the group who was being seated. She looked at me confused and I said I wanted a table for two. She just walked off and I followed her once again. As I walked behind her, I noticed that she kept pulling down her extremely short dress and kept wobbling in her 5 inch stilettos. It was not a cute look and it was at that very moment that I knew my terrible experience at Corso was just beginning.

The waiter brought us water after several minutes. I asked him for lemon and a straw. He seemed confused. I repeated myself again in both English and French. When he finally came back, he didn't bother to explain the dinner specials or ask if we had any questions regarding the menu. We inquired about the size of the sangria pitcher and instead of answering he said to look over a few tables down. We told him we couldn't see from where we were sitting. He said 'If you get up, you can see it.' We simply went ahead and ordered the sangria, the cheese pizza, the ravioli stuffed with burrata cheese and the linguini with shrimp. I requested to omit the 'chiles' from the linguini dish. Once again, he seemed confused. I tried to explain to him that it was a spicy ingredient and I cannot eat spicy food. He arrived with the pizza and handed it to my friend to place it down. We were not given any plates. I asked another waiter for plates. He also seemed confused and walked off. We enjoyed the pizza. When the pasta dishes arrived, he did not clear the table. He held the pasta dishes until we moved our own plates. My friend enjoyed his ravioli. However, you can count the raviolis on the plate, there were only 8. As for my dish, I was expecting decent size shrimp but instead I received tasteless overcooked imitation shrimp. On top of it all, the pasta was extremely spicy. After 25 min, the waiter comes to our table and asks if the food is okay. I tell him that the pasta is extremely spicy. He says 'Well, I wrote it down. Twice. It's not my fault the chef did it spicy.'

After our meal, he gathered the plates and disappeared. We waited 30 min and no one came to offer us coffee, dessert or better yet the bill. Since our waiter was MIA, we decided to call the restaurant and have someone bring our bill. A new hostess appeared with an even shorter dress than the last one. She asked us who our waiter was. We said we didn't know his name, as he failed to mention it at the beginning of the night. An older man showed up and the hostess was explaining the situation to him. I'm assuming that he is the owner/manager. He just starred at us from afar and walked away. When our waiter showed up, he seemed surprised that we were unhappy. He argued that the 'spicyness' wasn't his fault. He proceeds to tell us that it's for us to tell him if we want anything else. My jaw dropped. I don't hail a cab let alone hail down my waiter for a coffee or bill. He was lazy and rude. In result to his behaviour, he received a big fat $0 tip.

We were not compensated after this disastrous evening. The manager didn't bother showing his face to apologize. After eating the linguini dish I got extremely sick. I believe it was due to the fake 'shrimp'. Avoid Corso like the plague!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch to grab some pizza. It was the really not fresh. Poor quality and execution. You would think otherwise considering the price you are paying. I would of been more satisfied with a mom and pop cheap pizza than what I got."}
{"text":"A great brunch location! Our food was so delicious and there was tons of it! Everything tasted fresh and there were so many different flavor a on the plate. As with all of the waiters we met during our stay in Montreal, our waiter here was friendly and very welcoming. They had a great brunch deal that we didn't end up getting but it would be something to go back for."}
{"text":"I had dinner in corso 1471 that was my first time there I really like it specially the bartender Julie was amazing she gave us a lot of information about Montreal that was great experience in Montreal..."}
{"text":"Made a reservation earlier in the afternoon, for 7:15 we wanted to sit on the second floor patio. There was no problem once we arrived we didn't have to wait it wasn't too busy yet. Our waitress was very attentive she took our drink and food orders right away, we were shocked how quickly the food came out. My friend had the ravioli with a tomato eggplant sauce sprinkled with truffle oil. I had the penne with ground pork in a cream sauce with wilted broccolini. Both meals were very good the portion was quiet large for pasta. 

For dessert we both decided to have the creme brûlée and it too was very good, creme brûlée is a real favourite of mine. 

The second floor patio was a great experience you could see and people watch from above and below. 

My only bit of complaint was the martini I order was not what the description made it out to be, the \"sweet\" martini was in fact a very bitter martini, not a fan. 

But over all a very enjoyable meal for sure."}
{"text":"Ambiance is amazing. Its the largest and most entertaining terrace on Crescent. There's 2 floors and 2 separate bars. Its massive! Food is excellent and fairly priced. Pizza is excellent, staff is friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for a late dinner. I really like the balcony around the restaurant and decided to give it a shot. 

The ambiance and service were great, however I can't say so much for food. I ordered the Gnocchi and my friend ordered the Veal. My gnocchi was large and the filling was very bland. The sauce was also very bland. With gnocchi, the sauce is what makes the dish - this dish was fail. My friends Veal looked nice and juicy. Really cant  have an opinion for something i didn't try. 

I have some of the best Italian in Toronto, and this wasn't even close to it. The menu might need a complete make over."}
{"text":"We've spent a week in Montreal; most of the nights consisted of spending our time at a single bar, taking drinks down. But tonight, our last night, we took crescent street from the top down and bar hopped. Game 7 of the western conference finals (Anaheim and Chicago (go Chicago!)) was playing on a huge projector screen that we could easily see from the street. Several other TVS on the inside played the game as well. 

From the minute we walked in-we were satisfied. No other bars on that street seemed to compare to the kind of atmosphere, breezy, open concept type of space that Restaurant Corso provided. everything in there is fresh from the furniture to the food, to the people, staff, and overall style. The place was semi packed with customers ranging from 23-50 (at least). Anyone seems to be welcomed here, and it's a very chill, friendly environment. 


We were informed by the bartender that they had just opened about two weeks ago and that they didn't have a margarita/mixed drink menu just yet-but we weren't disappointed. There was a large selection of vodkas, whiskeys, rums, wines, bottled and draft beers to choose from. as for the food menu, everything was fresh and plentiful as well. We love Montreal pizza (odd for people who practically live in NYC) so we ordered & split a personal pie that was topped with sliced meatball, caramelized onions, fresh mozzarella cheese, and delicious tomato sauce. My boyfriend and I aren't the biggest fans of crust, but we devoured the entire thing. 

Overall, for a bar/restaurant that has just opened on such a buzzing block, we were more than satisfied with our service and experience. Blackhawks also won :)"}
{"text":"Très belle terrasse. Serveur très aimable. Plats assez simples."}
{"text":"Decent place. Nice view over the crescent street, modernly decorated.  Good servers and food."}
