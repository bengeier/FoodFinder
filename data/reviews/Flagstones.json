{"text":"This is a very good hotel bar. Nothing to complain about at all. I had the fried oysters and chopped salad both of which were delicious. I also had a delicious glass of red wine at a reasonable price or a hotel. I only ate here after resisting the temptation to eat bojangles but would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"This is the hotel restaurant inside the Renaissance South Park.  All I can say is WOW!  The service at the desk and at the bar is bar none!  I checked in today on Black Friday.   My experience was the absolute best.  I am a loyal Hilton member, however after my experience at the renaissance, I want to ONLY stay at Renaissance.  I sat at the bar with such friendly, accommodating waiters, bartenders and staff.  I watched the team give a glass of wine to the patron at the bar, as it was poured and not taken.  The bar manager notices that another patron is drinking the same wine and she generously gives her the glass!!!  WOW!    The service here is top notch!  I couldn't have asked for a better experience!  THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"I've stayed at the Renaissance South Park many times over the last four years when I was in the area for business. Flagstones, as others have pointed out, is the hotel bar/restaurant. The food is surprisingly good here. I've mostly had the appetizers like wings or barbecue flatbread-style pizza, but they are all nicely done. A particular standout is the kobe burger- it's expensive at $18 but the taste comes close to justifying the money you lay out for it. The fries that come with it are decent, but if you like burgers this is one you need to try.  The service is hit or miss. I understand that hotel bars can be insanely busy at times, but our server literally disappeared before giving us our check on a visit earlier this week. We had to get the bartender to cash our group out, but she was very apologetic and handled it all with class. The food was worth the hassle, and if you're staying at the hotel you should try it out."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Renaissance while visiting Charlotte and we stopped down at Flagstones bar located inside the hotel. Kat, our bartender was great. She made the experience one to remember. She was very customer service oriented without being annoying or overbearing and gave us lots of tips on places to visit during our stay. Kat told us that she's worked for Marriott for 10 years and we can see why. She is a Star associate and we are glad she served us.   As for the food...I got the turkey Reuben and my husband got the  habanero beef bbq sandwich. My turkey Reuben was great, but the bbq stole the show right along with Kat. It came with caramelized onions on it. Even if you don't like onions, try them on this sandwich. They make the sandwich sweet and savory all at the same time.   I'm a big fan of this food and even more of a fan of the service. Great job!!"}
{"text":"I like the view. You have a water fountain, bar, and just a really classy clean look all around.   First floor of the hotel. Very friendly waiters!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes is the fried green tomato sandwich good! Seriously, such a treat. The fry was perfect, the pimento cheese fueled my soul, and the goat cheese/bacon just topped it all off. The staff is also totally lovely. Three cheers for Morgan and Kyle, the dynamic duo! I frequent a lot of hotels, and would come back to the Renaissance just for the bar (though it's wonderful in its own right)."}
{"text":"You will see other reviews for flagstones under Renaissance Charlotte SouthPark Hotel but felt it deserved its own review as this is one of the rare hotel bars that stands on its own.   For one the bartender is one of the best I have seen as he is friendly, made good drinks and provided great service.  They have a full bar and a number of beers on tap and a good selection of wines including three different chardonnays ranging from naked to full on oaky. Like most hotel bars there is no real separation between it and the lobby but bar area is off to the side so almost like an alcove studio so feel separate as long as you do not turn around and see the windows of the rooms facing the open atrium.  Food was standard but good which is only reason might have given this place four stars.  With the large courtyard and friendly bartender and numerous tvs this place could satisfy most peoples needs even if not staying at the hotel."}
{"text":"Morgan W provided excellent service with a blend of charm and Southern hospitality that was awesome. The food was very good and ambience was surprisingly good as well. Did not feel like a a hotel bar/restaurant at all. Five stars all around!"}
