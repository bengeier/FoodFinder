{"text":"The Mizoriz bowl was very bland- lettuce was dirty and tasted stale, avocado was too ripe. Food definitely looks better than it tastes and portions are quite small.   Service was good and quick."}
{"text":"J'habite à côté et j'ai eu l'occasion de tester plusieurs produits et jamais de déception jusqu'à ce jour.  Les smoothies, acaï bowl et les jus sont bons et généreux (pas encore tout goûté mais le matcha peachu est top, le framboise chia également).  Gros coup de cur aussi pour leur bols et burritos (préférence pour les bols car on voit et on apprécie le goût de chacun des ingrédients, la compote de courge musquée humm..), j'aime tellement le los Pavos que je n'ai pas encore eu l'occasion de goûter leurs salades mais je pense que je finirai par me laisser tentée!   Pour finir le lieu est agréable, le personnel aussi donc je recommande sans hésiter."}
{"text":"Although I'm just visiting and only spent a few hours in Mile End, you can tell this spot is the new kid on the block, but I love that the location and interiors make such a statement. With sliding floor to ceiling windows, the shop can be fully opened for a breezy shop, which is awesome.   Upon entrance, the shop is bright, green and fresh. Fresh herbs and small potted plants are the centerpieces for the tables, but it's not your usual setup. It's like a small ecosystem at the center of the shop with artificial and natural lights to activate photosynthesis. Pretty cool concept in my opinion.  The workers are friendly and greet you promptly. Menus are in French, but the workers are helpful so ask questions if you need. Since it was all new to me, I decided to go with Noix-Vocado since it sounded like it would be tasty. I enjoy avocado smoothies, so why not take a chance?  Noix-Vocado: avocats, noisettes, sirop d'erable, chocolat noir, beurre d'arachides, amandes torrefiees, lait d'amandes, bananes tranchees, mueslix, and pêches. It tasted like a date shake. Super creamy and smooth, you could definitely take this on the go for a liquid breakfast. Pricing is fair for what you get too and it kept me pretty full for awhile!  My friend got the Matcha Peachu with mangues, ananas, bananes, peches, lait d'amanes, matcha and sirop d'erable. Personally, I would find myself coming through if I lived nearby, but I was glad to come across it and try it."}
{"text":"I've been twice now, and had the Burrito Bol and the burrito itself both times.   The weird thing about the food is that it looks good but is actually very very average. Tasty is not a word I would use to describe it. I do not recall any sense of pleasurable sensation while eating it, or afterwards. In short: It's BLAND.  It's also overpriced for what it is, and the portions are small.   On the other hand, smart shoppers know that if you cross the street and go one block west, you can get some veggie food that will knock your socks off, in a memorable way."}
{"text":"The most delicious smoothie I've had in a long time. Will definitely be coming back. They use vitamixers and can make smoothies with Kale blended right in and you don't need a separate juicer they're so good.  I recommend the Kale, banana, pineapple, avocado, fruit juice and ice mix.  I think it's called Le Chou Chou."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this place  Everybody who knows me, knows I'm a meat-eater to the core but I love healthy food to balance everything out.  We had the red and yellow fresh juice: absolutely lovely!  My favorite was the red which was a mix of beets , green apple, ginger and lemon.  I do not have a sweet tooth and I rarely drink juice so this juice was the perfect mix of flavor: a tad sweet and acidic.  We had a burrito which had brown rice and tuna.  The star of the show for me was the tuna tataki salad and that Sriracha Lime Hoisin dressing! Wow!"}
{"text":"Steve just opened his doors to bringing a bit of the healthy green Westcoast vibe to Mile End. Vancouver and BC inspired, Vertu serves up fresh pressed juice, smoothies, custom salads and burritos/wraps.   Theyre still putting art on the walls, and yet to pull the backing paper off the window decals of this bright St Viateur @ Waverly corner space. Always love seeing what new biz pops up in the hood and this one is a welcomed addition to my Mile End routine.   Love the ambiance. 'Fresh' is the word du jour here. The two hydroponic columns of grow lights, watering tubes and potted herbs with figure eight bar and stools wrapped around them is brilliant.    Fresh pressed health: to infinity and beyond!!  The juice was fabulous.  Check it! Wifi Credit and debit accepted."}
{"text":"I went for a salad but decided to make my own. At 75 cents a topping it added up quick and my salad was 17$... I didn't think I was putting that much. The salad itself was quite small as well not a big enough portion.  The dressing selection was lacking as well, nothing interesting. And no bacon topping ??!!! Overall very overpriced, very bland, nothing special at all."}
{"text":"Nouveau commerce du Mile-End, Verte offre des smoothies et bols qui sont frais et bons. On y trouve une belle sélection de breuvages en bouteilles également. Le décor est frais et agréable et par temps ensoleillé on peut également profiter des 4 tables à pique-nique extérieures. Mon smoothies était délicieux et le prix raisonnable."}
{"text":"I used to love this place! The Noix-vocado and the Matcha-Peachu smoothies used to be amazing. Lately I find the mute not on point anymore. The salads are good but the dressings are okay....this place has tons of potential but they need to step up their game!"}
{"text":"Bon mais terriblement cher pour ce que c'est. Service moyennement sympathique et lent."}
{"text":"J'avais envie d'essayer ce nouveau bar à jus dans le Mile-End, j'ai pas été déçu ! Je voulais un smoothie en cette journée de canicule montréalaise, ils ont 5 sortes de smoothies, j'ai pris le ''noix-vocado'' (avocats / noisettes / sirop d'érable/ chocolat noir / beurre d'arachides / pêches / lait d'amandes / mueslix / amandes torréfiées / bananes tranchées) format normal 16 oz / 8,95$ taxe incluse, super bon et à mon avis, meilleur que les autres bars à jus que j'ai goûté auparavant sur le Plateau, en terme de qualité. Ils ont bien entendu sur leur menu des jus frais / eaux infusées / salades / burritos / tartares végétariens / coupe de fruits frais / coupe de légumes frais / ... Déjà populaire, y'avait un line-up. Beaucoup de personnel derrière le comptoir et en cuisine. Prix normal quoi que. Belle déco colorée + super les 2 colonnes hydroponiques verticales. C'est neuf, c'est propre, c'est frais. Je reviendrais sûrement me reprendre un autre smoothie. Terrasse extérieure. Wifi gratuit.  5/5 visité en juillet 2016"}
{"text":"I like the idea of this place, but I think it needs a lot of work. The place is pretty and clean and somewhat modern looking, but it's overpriced for what you get. For a place that sells you on the idea of nature, freshness, and healthy, it is strange that nearly everything is sold in plastic. I paid$15 for a tuna salad that came in a plastic container. At least I got a real fork to use. The salad was decent if a little overdressed. The raw Ramen added a nice crunch to the salad and reminded me of my childhood when we used to eat this terribly processed snack as a treat. Again, seems a little bit out of place in a restaurant that is selling us on the idea of fresh and healthy. This place has a lot of potential but I think there needs to be a lot more thought put into how the food is presented to customers, more attention to the recipes, and more thinking of how the parts fit in with the whole concept. There are no other restaurants in this area that focus on salads and freshness. So potentially this restaurant can do very well. But it's not a very welcoming place in the way that it is set up and looks like it's focused on takeout. There are many lovely little grocery stores in the area, and in that way this restaurant is not offering something really different and competitive. And because they are on the pricier side for what is being offered, I don't see them lasting in the fickleness of the food business."}
