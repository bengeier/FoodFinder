{"text":"Pros: I'll have to get back to you when I think of one.

Cons: 
-Only 4 items on the menu. Chicken sandwich, chicken sandwich, chicken tenders and a turkey sandwich. 
-Only 2 side items on the menu. incredibly salty french fries and apple wedges
-The concept is \"no freezers\". Who cares, when you deep fry everything in oil.
-\"PDQ\" which stands for \"Pretty Darn Quick\" is by far from the truth. Takes much longer than any other fast food restaurant.
-Atmosphere is about as appealing as the inside of a parking garage.
-Expensive for what you get. the combo meal consisting of any entree item (all the same price), one of the two side items and drink will cost you about $8.
-Charge extra for a packet of sauce

Bottom Line: if you craving a chicken sandwich or chicken tenders, go to Chick-Fil-A. It's cheaper, much quicker and the exact same quality.  The chicken sandwich at PDQ isn't awful; but it isn't worth the money they charge at PDQ."}
{"text":"This place is fun. It is pedal powered hand washing station, touchscreen order kiosk, check in on foursquare and get a high five from staff members, chicken mascot directing a local high school choir, QR code on the tray liners, secret password for an extra Chicken Tender kind of fun. Definitely not a typical fast food joint.

The menu boasts no freezers and all natural poultry, and the juicy Chicken Tenders and fries that are hand cut daily are complemented by a parade of four sauces. Sweet Heat, Honey Mustard, Creamy Garlic and Chipotle BBQ are all begging to go to a tailgate party.

Salads have recently been added to the menu, and the Grilled Turkey Salad with Blueberry Vinaigrette is a palatable alternative to the fried options. The hand-spun milkshakes are seductive, and the fresh squeezed lemonade adds surprising tang to the meal.

Don't let the name and branding confuse you. PDQ isn't an acronym for \"Pretty Darn Quick\" or \"Poultry Dairy Queen\". It stands for \"People Dedicated to Quality\", and the food and service both live up to the moniker."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy. I have been twice and had the grilled chicken sandwich both times. It was - well - just ok. Wasn't bad but wasn't great either. Fries were very, very salty. I actually prefer Chick-fil-A grilled chicken sandwich with a side of cole slaw better."}
{"text":"I'd really love to give PDQ five stars to offset the lower ratings that have spanked this relatively new establishment. Give it another year to work out the visions and I'll be changing my rating to a five. I first went to PDQ with a buddy shortly after it opened. There were chefs...um...yes...chefs...working on some different concepts for dishes while we were there. The reason there have been so few items on the menu is that this is still being conceptualized and adapting to its patrons and environment.

So who cares if they don't freeze anything? Um...how about me. Fried or not, fresh food always tastes better.

Why not go to Chik-fil-A since it's cheaper? How about more food, and better tasting chicken?

Who really wants their fries really salty? How about anybody that actually likes french fries? 

Lastly, blah blah blah grilled chicken this or that. Why go out to buy a grilled chicken sammy anyhow?


I've only been to PDQ twice now, but their chicken is beyond juicy and incredibly flavorful. The sauces are great too! The fries are great...and so surprising to find them freshly made. 

This place is fun for the kids with their little hand-washing station. My son liked the food so much, he said it was the best day ever...lol.

In addition to great food, the decor has an open and bright diner feel, while engaging some artistic authority by using an array of industrial inspired fixtures.


Try: The Crispy Chicken Sammy, Fries and a Cheerwine

Avoid: Ordering something you could easily make at home (this means you grilled chicken sandwich people)"}
{"text":"Thrkey qas burned on the outside and uncooked on the inside. Not really a fan."}
{"text":"Very Limited menu  Probably won't survive in this economy"}
{"text":"I tell you, I love PDQ.  The menu is limited, but that is fine, because it's all good stuff.   I think the idea of putting the handwashing sink at the front of the place is genious.  Having small kids, I love it because I don't have to drag them into the bathroom to wash them up.  I think the sink idea should now be standard in all fast food - it's a great idea.  

On to the good stuff.  The fries are a bit of an addiction.  Fresh cut, crinkle fries with just the right amount of salt.  So good.  Even better if you dip them in the garlic dipping sauce that is intended for the chicken.  Swoon.  

The Thanksgiving sandwich is tasty and a bit different for a fast food place.  I can count on one hand the number of times I have ever eaten chicken tenders at a restaurant, but at PDQ I will because they are great!  Don't even get me started on that sinful toffee dip that comes with the apple slices!  Forget the apples, just get me a spoon.  

The staff reminds me of Chic-fil-A folks.  Friendly, eager and almost too perky to be working in a fast food place.  Can't argue with that.  They will even come to your table to refill your drinks."}
{"text":"I am addicted to their chicken tenders with the creamy garlic dressing!!!

I agree that their menu is a little limited and little more expensive than the standard fast-food fare we're all (unfortunately) used to.  But I think the freshness and quality are more than worth the limits and price.  Besides, when I do go to other fast-food joints, I generally order the same thing every time anyway, don't you?

I'm glad to hear about the new salads--can't wait to try them.  Maybe I'll be able to wean myself off the chicken tenders.

They're outside dining area is great--very grown up-ish, with ceiling fans and all.  I can't wait to sit out there some day, like when it's not 100 degrees out.

My one and only complaint is the flavor of their buns.  I'm not a big fan of whole wheat anyway, but I really don't like the buns.  So I just don't order the sandwiches.  Fine with me--I prefer the other options anyway.

And if you think the service is slow (it's not), the drive-through is faster than counter service.  Just a little tip from me to y'all."}
{"text":"Fast food done right. This is place is a new concept where everything is fresh with no freezers onsite. The food is good and worth the money."}
{"text":"PDQ is a great fast food option. You won't find a cleaner fast food restaurant anywhere. Their floors are probably cleaner than the tables at the Burger King down the street. Love the hand washing station. It's great for those of us who avoid public bathrooms at just about all costs (except wetting oneself).
The crinkle cut fries are great and well-seasoned and the crispy chicken sandwich is marvelous. They make their dressings and dipping sauces fresh. The honey mustard is drinkable."}
{"text":"Awesome every time. I can not believe it did,not make it."}
{"text":"So PDQ (Pretty Darn Quick) which serves Fresh Fast Food is like walking distance from where I live.  I have now ate there about 6 times, and I have to say its Pretty Darn YUMMY..... lol.  But I never thought about writing a review until I ordered one of there new Salads today.  I usually order the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, but when I saw they had Salads now, I just knew I had to try one, so I ordered the Crispy Chicken Salad.  Now, I have to admit that I didn't even really pay attention to what else was in the actual salad or even inquire about the dressing when I ordered it.  I just knew I was hungry, and wanted to try the Crispy Chicken Salad.  When it was delivered to my table the first thing I noticed was that it was in this awesome plastic bowl, and second was that it was HUGE.... lol.  Again, I was hungry, so this wasn't an issue, but the salad only cost $5.95, and I would never expected that size of a salad to come out.  Now, I don't remember what all was in the salad, but it had all the regulars you would expect, but I will have to say it already included the Dressing which was amazing, and had NO IDEA what is was until I asked one of the ladies that worked there.  When she said it was \"Honey Mustard\" I was completely shocked!!!  I would have never thought in a million years to use Honey Mustard as a Dressing for a Salad, but I have to say it REALLY works.  The chicken at PDQ is simply amazing!!!  Every time I have had it there it just hits the spot.  The freshness is what really makes it an experience considering this place is technically Fast Food.  I know this is the first PDQ to open, and I hope to see more around the Charlotte area in the coming years.  I highly recommend this place as they have a smart idea here, and I love how the menu is very small and limited.  I can't wait to go back and have another Salad!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday afternoon to try the crispy chicken sandwich.  As in the first visit, the food was good and the customer service was top-notch.  

Taking a page from another well-known quick-service joint, they have started a milkshake happy hour between 2:00pm - 4:00pm.

This place serves good fresh food.  But I'm concerned about their survival because their price points can seem pretty high.  And while I'm willing to pay a little more for fresh food, I don't know that enough of the general population shares my sentiments.  But I hope I'm wrong...."}
