{"text":"Super friendly staff - owner is around, will stop for a chat. Have been here several times and the place is always busy. The 10$ dinner specials are well worth it! Great pierogies!  Food is good - the side salad and entry salads are really good. Bar prices are very reasonable. They also apparently have different cheesecakes delivered with some pretty unique flavors (apple walnut, creamscicle) I have not had them yet but the waitress has said they are good. Nice casual hang out spot."}
{"text":"Very low key restaurant/bar, probably the nicest staff I have ever met.  The food is good and the lunch specials are very reasonable.  If you are a sports fan they run really nice deals during Indians/browns games."}
{"text":"Filthy. Years of collected grime on everything. Have to wonder what the kitchen looks like. Service was friendly. Prices were average. Food was not good enough for me to ever return or recommend."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for over 20 years, and never noticed this place.  I am happy that some friends and I chose to meet up here.  I didn't get anything to eat during my visit, but as the waitress delivered plate after plate of food to the other patrons I decided to make it a point to come back for dinner.  The staff is really friendly, and extremely attentive."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The bar tenders are like family and they'll go out of their way to make sure you have a good experience.  I've drank here a few times and only eaten here once and have always had a good time.  The chocolate cake dessert is enough for four people and absolutely delicious.  It's a huge slab of decadent cake and rich chocolate frosting and chocolate mousse that's then doused in chocolate syrup with whipped cream.  Yum The beer prices are good and the atmosphere  is homey.  Like a semi-clean dive bar.  The food is alright.  But I don't really go there for the food."}
{"text":"It is still closed. No longer in business !!!  They are up for sale as of today.  I hope a new owner buys the place."}
{"text":"Whistlestop, I love you but I was a little disappointed by a couple things on my most recent visit there: I ordered the Thursday Special which was a 10 oz Sirloin Steak with vegetables and a baked potato and choice of soup or salad for $10, a fabulous deal!! 1.) The soup was cold and I had to give it back to the server to nuke it in the microwave.  However, it was really delicious once it was heated up. I believe it was sausage soup with penne.   2.) They served me an old and brown baked potato not once, but twice (my friend ordered the same thing and her potato was perfect) so I gave up and ordered fries 3.) They did not have the peppercorn brandy sauce (which was absolutely divine) that I had with my steak that last time I was here because they have a new cook now and he/she doesn't know how to make it 4.) I had a craving for unhealthy foods and ordered the lemon chiffon cheesecake with vanilla ice cream.  The cheesecake was good, but the ice cream was freezer burned, half melted and gritty.  Overall, my experience wasn't too bad because the server was quick to fix whatever mistakes there were and he was very friendly.  The service was 5 stars, but the food was 2 which is why I chose the 3 star rating.  After all that went down I will not give up on Whistlestop.  I feel as if I just caught them on a bad day and look forward to my next dining experience"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Owner told us we could be safe and smart to leave our vehicle in the parking lot. When we get there to pick it up its been towed. When I called to ask about it the owner practically called me a lair and said its not his problem. Great way to treat your customer for not drinking and driving !!! Horrible business ethics...well cost me 100$ to never return there again!"}
