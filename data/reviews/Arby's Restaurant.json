{"text":"I know Arby's has a bad reputation, but I don't think it's all fair. Yeah, the roast beef and cheddar sandwiches aren't the best, but Arby's does have the best chicken sandwich of all the fast food joints. That chicken, bacon and swiss sandwich is the real deal. It's a great chicken fillet topped with honey mustard, swiss cheese and peppered bacon. The thing is tremendous. Their fries aren't bad either and as long as you sick to these (and maybe their mozza sticks) you'll be safe.... Really, if you haven't had their chicken sandwich, give it a try...."}
{"text":"The best location Arby's in Calgary, the curly fries and beef'n cheddar are the best."}
{"text":"If you are familiar with Arbys you will know what thier standard menu consists of shaved roast beef sandwiches  with various condiments and toppings.... many find them tasty. They also have curly fries and regular. I am not a curly fry fan, they seem to be coated in some kind of battery stuff, and I find it kinda gross.  The actual restaurant at this location is kind of sad inside....the tables and chairs seem to be still trapped in the 80's with  teal blues and pinks...yowsa. The service is just ok....nothing special. If you like arbys I would go to a different location."}
{"text":"5 years since the last review, I thought I'd take the time to mention that yes, this Arby's is still around. Sitting on the edge of downtown, next to the Stampede Grounds, slowly being engulfed by large residential towers on all sides, this Arby's still clings to the past with nary a facelift over the decades.   Still rocking the same weird 90's pink stucco. Still slinging the same Beef 'N Cheddar burger sandwich things that they always have.   A little bit of childhood nostalgia goes to this fast food chain for getting little kid Dale so excited about curly fries. Arby's had curly fries before the early 90's curly fry fad started. That's right. Arby's is a curly fry hipster.  Make sure to load up on Arby's sauce, a not so tangy, tangy BBQ Sauce thing and Horsey Sauce: Mayo meets horseradish and had all the flavour removed. Some how they got under my skin at an early age and even though they're bland and tasteless, I still love the sauces.  They've got a parking lot - Not that you're going to drive here, but it does put some distance between you and anyone kind of \"stabby\" looking. Sort of like the massive open courtyards surrounding Japanese Palaces..."}
{"text":"All I ever get from here are Jr Roast beef sandwiches... Which aren't too bad. The parking enforcement is crazy here. Just today I was going to grab a cup of tea at the starbucks right beside this location before heading into Arby's to pick up lunch. The moment I even gravitated to the starbucks some guy wearing sunglasses pops out of his car with a ticket pad in hand. I saw this and rushed back to my car... He saw me coming so he quickly attempted to look like he was looking at other cars.   Other than crazy parking patrol man, this location has quick service and I can usually get in and out of here within a few minutes. The cashiers are always nice, and they remember to ask you about extra sauces in the bag and don't critize you when you ask for more...  They have a drive thru as well! Which is always a plus for me as I'm too lazy to walk the five meters to the entrance...   May have to venture into getting different items to add some variety in my life."}
{"text":"Really good and quick for mall service. Great beef and cheddar sandwich always fresh."}
{"text":"Pretty good with the new renovations. Great atmosphere. Near Talisman center with good milkshake after a work out and basketball. Very nice location and food. The beef and cheddar sandwich was fresh."}
{"text":"I made my once-and-only-once trip to Arby's today. One time (and JUST one time) a year, I inexplicably find myself \"thinking Arby's\" despite all of my better judgement.    After picking up my car from the repair shop, I wanted to celebrate by torturing my insides with second-rate fast food. Arby's had a 2-for-$4 deal going on for breakfast and I was keenly intrigued with thoughts of \"What the hell would Arby's even offer for breakfast\"?  It was sort of like a car crash where you're so morbidly fascinated you can't look away.  I ordered two \"bacon and egg\" breakfast sandwiches. The good: Real eggs.Real bacon - not that weird crap Subway tries to pass off as a pork product.  The bad: So greasy that the bun reflected sunlight.   In conclusion, go here for breakfast if you absolutely have to get Arby's out of your system. It's standard fast food fare - and as Yelp would put it, it was A-OK."}
{"text":"Very good roast beef sandwiches.  Nice environment. I wish websites coordinate with their stores because product they sell is different for each store."}
