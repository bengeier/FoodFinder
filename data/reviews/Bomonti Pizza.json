{"text":"I order from this place often. The hot wings are one of the best in the area. The pizza is good and their salads are huge. The salads have fresh vegetables, no brown lettuce like most restaurants. The hoagies are average. I have never gotten anything bad here. The staff are very nice people as well.  I would refer this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I always order delivery from here. I've never had a bad meal delivered to me yet. Their burgers are amazing. Pizza is great amount of toppings and tastes amazing. Fast service cheap prices and great  quality of food."}
{"text":"We wanted something that we could get pretty quickly that would be tasty.  We ordered from here and got it delivered . It arrived on time and it was still very warm.  We ordered 2 calzones; seafood and Italian and they were pretty large. My boyfriend has a large appetite and he was fun after eating it. I didn't finish mine but I have a smaller appetite.  They were very full. They were spilling out the sides, so there was no shortage of yummy toppings. It wasn't the best calzone we have ever had but it was very yummy. Not too greasy and the outside was crisp.  If you're hungry , and you want something filling, this would be the option. We would order from here again to have them deliver it. We look forward to ordering something else from here"}
{"text":"So, I break pizza joints into many different categories. And I happen to live in the area of Pittsburgh that primarily consists of Middle Eastern/Mediterranean Pizza, which means, the menu will usually offer, Burgers/Pizza/Gyros/baklava etc. And in this category, Bomonti's might be the best that I've had. Full disclosure, I've only had pizza and wings so far at this establishment, but everytime, they have been top notch. The thing that stands out the most for me with this pizza is the sauce. Some of the best I've ever had. The wings are super crispy and not your typical hot sauce. I will admit that this pizza isn't as good as some of the, what I would describe as 'Designer/Hip Pizza', such as pizzaiolo or sienna mezzo. But for what it is, it's pretty frickin awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered the buffalo chicken pizza through their online ordering system. Very easy & user friendly. Pizza arrived on time if not a little bit early! The pizza was very yummy. I would definitely recommend Bomonti Pizza to others"}
