{"text":"I like the decor of this restaurant and the staff is nice. I've been here twice, I got the grilled cheese, I didn't like it I could barely taste the cheese and one side was  slightly burnt. 

The second time I went was a few weeks ago and had a better experience food was great, I got the filet mignon (orange menu, always changes) cooked perfect, nice and warm, very tender. 

It is expensive. I'd go back again"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Bistro 67 for the first time last night and it was decent. I will say right off the bat that the service was excellent. Our waitress, Amanda, was super pleasant and very knowledgeable about the dishes. She checked on us and made sure we were taken care of without hovering too much.

There were some imaginative seasonal items on the menu that we really enjoyed. There was a grilled pineapple pina colada that was superb, along with a cauliflower \"potato\" salad that I really loved. We shared a charcuterie board (that had the most delicious in-house pickled beets) and that's where we started to notice what we deemed the one \"issue\" of the night: lack of seasoning. The pork terrine would have been great, with a little salt and pepper. The rabbit would have been great, with a little salt and pepper. Nothing at all was bad! Just needed more salt and pepper.

Our entrees fared a little better. The vegetables from their garden that were served with dinner were lovely. The potatoes boulangere were super tasty and well seasoned. I had the beef tenderloin and despite feeling it needed a little more seasoning, it was still so tender and good. My husband had the lamb, and though a little fatty for his tastes, he still enjoyed it.

Altogether, the meal was enjoyable. I will definitely go back and give it another try, especially to see what the seasonal offerings are."}
{"text":"Very tasty food! The people are friendly and I love that the students seem to be of varied abilities. Sometimes the service is a bit slow but the food is always worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The environment and service is alright. However, the food is overpriced and bland. For this price range there are many better options in Whitby. I understand it's part of a culinary school, so it is chefs in training. Which is fine, but have the pricing properly reflect on that then..."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was excellent! I ordered the wild fried rice dish with a panko coated soft boiled egg. When the dish was brought to me I noticed right away that it contained chicken (I'm vegetarian). I flagged this to our server and she apologized profusely. I didn't mind terribly - mistakes happen! Plus I was brought a new dish within minutes. Aaaaand it was delicious. 

At the end of the meal we asked for the bill and our server told us they had taken my dish off the bill because of the mix up, which was super nice and very appreciated. 

We'll be back again to try their Wednesday date night menu :)"}
{"text":"I was very excited to first try this restaurant thinking it would be a great meal for a really reasonable price, however, I was incredibly disappointed. The food and wine is quite expensive, much more than you think a culinary school restaurant would be. The food itself wasn't even good to make up for the steep price. I had the goat cheese and beet salad to start and it was bland and a fairly small. I had the steak and frites for my main course and it was good, however, my steak was overcooked, which was very disappointing considering it was about a $30 entree. Also our desserts took over a half an hour and they were also disappointing and tasted underbaked."}
{"text":"Most of the food was great. specialty drinks and desserts are massively over priced.   I had the beef burger and it was fantastic.  Fries tasted like they came from the chip truck up the street.  Calamari were amazing.  Bread and Hummus was amazing.  My Gin and Tonic tastes like tequila which I loved but that's not what one would expect, very strange.   They said it was \"Dillons\" gin? Never heard of it."}
{"text":"Time to go to where many of our favourite chefs started....school! Durham College has a culinary arts program that allows their chefs-in-training to practice in a real restaurant kitchen. Love this! In fact, there's a screen in the dining room where you can see chefs making your meal. The next big chef could be cooking you dinner and you didn't even know it!  

That's not all; it's field to fork. When you drive by on Champlain Ave or drive to the restaurant parking, you can see their gardens and there are plans for greenhouses too! It doesn't get any fresher than that. Whatever is in season is what they're serving.  

The venue itself is beautiful. Bright orange walls were the backdrop for the dark wood tables facing floor to ceiling windows. Everything was beautifully designed, right down to the lighting and table setting. Great atmosphere. Once the construction at the college is complete, the view from your second floor seat will become much more esthetically pleasing. 

After we ordered our drinks, bread and a house spread. The bread was fresh and the spread was AMAZING. Garlic, shallots and a whole lot of yum. When our Warm Baked Flatbread arrived, we kept what was left of the spread and used it for the flatbread too! Marinated tomatos, fontina cheese, sherry onions and even more garlic all on a flatbread fresh out of the oven. The toppings were tasty, but not overwhelming. We made quick work of it even though it was huge. 

For mains we went with Steak Frites, Local Cornish Hen & Grilled Birch-Glazed Salmon. The Cornish Hen was tender, juicy and was infused with citrus. The strong citrus flavours were cut nicely with the pepperoncini polenta. Fantastic combination. The piece of salmon was HUGE. The picture doesn't do it justice; it was easily over an inch thick. The roasted peppers were great but the potatoes weren't fully cooked. The Steak Frites was probably the favourite. The steak was tender and well seasoned. The fries were truffled, sprinkled with thyme and served with tomato jam. You read it - JAM. This was not your grocery store ketchup. It had such a unique flavour that I have nothing to compare it to. Either way, it was fantastic. Gotta try it! 

The service was great. They were quick, attentive and knowledgeable. They are very professional. You wouldn't even know that the people there are in training to be chefs because it tasted like they were pros already! 

I realize they just put a huge logo for this place right ON the building, but it just doesn't stand out. I know if I'm looking for a restaurant, I'm looking for the traditional big sign near the road. If you're not from the area, you might not find it.  

This was my first meal at the culinary school and it won't be my last. Support your local college and give them feedback to make them the best of the best!"}
{"text":"Nasturtium, what's that and so we googled and learned it isn't a NASTY radioactive chemical element. To learn is to experience and if these culinary students are already using words and foods the ordinary citizens don't even know, they are ahead of the game after all why else would these students pay tuition.

Green-certified teaching-inspired 'Field-to-Fork' vision, it sounds like a salad to me.

Baby watercress and nasturtium ($8)
Strawberries | filberts | lavender peach vinaigrette

Roasted porchetta ($13) with Soup of the Day
Calabrese roll | fig confit | arugula | rosemary aioli

DC frittata ($15)
House sausage | goat cheese | roasted bell peppers | cilantro and chives

The concept, ingredients, dishes, plating and execution were all well done.  It was the Roasted Porchetta dish that gave me the thought that they really know what they're doing.  Perfect seasoning on good selection cut of pork made this meal memorable.

While there's good, there's also advice to keep in mind.  The salad had such fresh, fruitiness with the spicy bitterness of nasturtium it needed some more savoriness and texture.  The frittata was less frittata in volume and more like a pancake and slightly oily.

From the way I see, the service needs a few more study sessions after school and during.  It was not as polished as the space and the food, so it threw the meal off and as a \"restaurant\", all aspects should be considered.  Overall grade = B"}
{"text":"We enjoyed dinner with friends here last night. The appetizer calamari was delicious and the bread was very nice, served at the table with a nice curry butter. It was really great service. However the entry was just ok. For $35 for a steak dinner, I would expect high quality. The sides were good but Sparse. And the size of the steak was so small! For such an expensive dinner, I'd expect to leave feeling very satisfied with the food. It was just ok."}
{"text":"Classy, pricey restaurant on Durham College's campus is a unique 'farm to field' experience that is fun to try - but ultimately a bit lacking in execution. Service and decor is excellent, though! Menu changes seasonally, as expected.

WHAT WE LIKED: Moroccan Braised Boneless Beef Short Ribs. Cauliflower was fun to try.
WHAT WE DIDN'T: Lamb tacos were meh. Seafood fettuccine was disappointing. 
WHAT I'D GET NEXT: Spanish Meatballs? Game Farm chicken breast? But the menu changes seasonally, so who knows? 

Swung by on a Friday evening, with reservations. Parking is ample on campus, space is upstairs and spacious with a modern look. We were greeted by a friendly server and a simple menu. The food took a bit to come, but complimentary bread comes with orders - and it's pretty good!

Note: we came on Earth Hour day, so the lights went out mid-meal, which made some of the pictures a lower quality than usual. They accommodated all patrons with extra candles and opening all the blinds.

TANDOORI CAULIFLOWER: good portion size to share, interesting flavour. It's something new and I'm glad I tried it. It is lacking 'kick' and I'm not sure that tandoori spices and cauliflower compliment each other amazingly well, but it's a unique take and vegetarian-friendly. Try to eat the cauliflower with the bread (it goes better like that).

LAMB TACOS: Two tacos for $18 better be spectacular... and this wasn't. There was a decent sized lamb chunk in the taco, but the wrap itself was not big, and the flavour was mediocre. There's better lamb for cheaper.

SEAFOOD FETTUCCINE: Value-wise ($20), it's just not there. Hard pass. (Picture missing due to Earth Hour.)

MOROCCAN BEEF SHORT RIBS: most of the meat was actually REALLY tender - a couple of rougher chunks, but that's normal. The flavour was fairly good: it was a bit gamey and husky, and strong. Taste-wise, definitely the best option we had. The mash was fluffy and creamy, and went quite well. As with the others though, it's a bit small. I recommend trying this.



It's a fun experience to come, and I think there is enough on the menu that caught my eye that I'll eventually want to come back. It is a pricey experience, but there is value in sustainable food practices, and field-to-fork is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Dined here on Friday night on a recommendation from a friend.  Was excited to try the farm to table concept and the fact that it is part of the culinary school was intriguing.

Dining room quite nice.  Long and minimal with large windows overlooking the garden.  We were seated quickly and met by our friendly server.  Drinks came quickly and since we were so hungry our order was placed and the food started to arrive.

We started with the Beet Salad, Fish Tacos and Chicken wings (as I said - we were hungry).

Beet Salad was great.
Fish tacos were the winners.  Fish was light and crispy and my girlfriend loved the balance against the slaw.
Chicken wings were ok.  Lovely spice combo and fall off the bone meat.

For mains we had the seafood pasta and the burger.

Seafood pasta was homemade and quite nice.  The fish was tasty, however, my girlfriend noted that of the five mussels that were neatly arranged around the plate, one of them was unopened and inedible.  As a culinary school this seems like a basic teaching concept - don't serve the unopened mussel.

I had the Gastriqe burger which sadly was over cooked.  Tasty but the meat unfortunately was dry. It was also served on the narrowest of boards which allowed very little wiggle room for spillage of the messy burger toppings.  Fries were okay but had to ask twice for the ketchup, and twice for my napkin to be replaced.

Dessert. My girlfriend has a severe tree nut allergy which was advised at the time of booking and also when we arrived and were seated, so we were disappointed that our server overlooked the biscotti on my cappuccino plate and handed it down to me.  Had to remind her of that which she took away but that was the third event that got me thinking that the servers may need better training.

The Pear Ice cream and waffle were delicious and the stout chocolate cake was not too sweet but nothing special.

Prices were decent but the server charged us for something we did not order that was quickly rectified but I'd say that was the fourth strike.

Overall a pleasant experience with a few kinks.  Work those out and we'd possibly come back."}
{"text":"Loved the farm to table concept in a teaching restaurant.  The long dining room is beautiful and intimate with fantastic view of their \"farm\" outside and in the dimming light of the evening, it was very romantic.  

We shared the charcuterie board (pretty good with excellent house made pickles that were not too salty) and the kale caesar salad (also good but the croutons were teeth-breakingly hard).  My summer radish risotto was choke full of vegetables with great texture (and also didn't make me feel guilty eating a big bowl of carbs) and uncomplicated seasoning made for a winning entree.  My husband's beef tenderloin dish was also well executed with beautifully cooked steak (medium rare).  

Their wine list is heavy on VQA wines which is fine for whites but left a lot to be desired for my husband's red selection.  

I wouldn't mind going back for a quiet brunch with my daughter."}
{"text":"At first, I had our reservations booked a month in advance and when we got there we got seated near the entrance which seemed very noisy and busy; a simple request and we were moved to a much nicer spot with a great view.
 
Our server was more than knowledgeable about the menu, a slight screw up but it was cleared up immediately with dessert thrown in for free. The food, oh boy, was so delicious! I was disappointed that it had to end. 

I highly recommend giving this a try. You will love the experience! I am going to become a regular."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! This is probably my third time coming to this place, and everytime i eat here I'm reminded of why I came.

This restaurant is located inside the Centre for Food at the Durham Campus.  Service and food is prepared by culinary students who are enrolled in the program. They use nothing but the freshest ingredients, in fact they grow their own vegetables!

We were fortunate to be able to order from their \"new\" menu.  For appetizers, we ordered mushroom fondue, and apple/pumpkin bruschetta For the mains I ordered the Moroccan beef rib, while others ordered the halibut fish. It was absolutely amazing.

Nothing but good things to say about this place, it's about time Whitby got a restaurant as good as this!"}
{"text":"Bistro 67 located inside the Centre for Food at Durham College's Whitby campus, has all the visions I would love to support.

Green-certified teaching-inspired
'Field-to-Fork' vision

The building and the restaurant is just modern and glorious. Love the view of the vegetable garden as I could imagine how fresh all my salad was.

We ended up sharing the following from the lunch menu:

Baby watercress and nasturtium ($8)
Strawberries | filberts | lavender peach vinaigrette

Roasted porchetta ($13) with Soup of the Day
Calabrese roll | fig confit | arugula | rosemary aioli

DC frittata ($15)
House sausage | goat cheese | roasted bell peppers | cilantro and chives

I enjoyed the plating and the freshness of all the food I ate. I just wish they have a prix lunch menu similar to other teaching college restaurant I had been to. 

Beer on draft has selection from Ontario Craft Brewery and they also has an interesting cocktail list.

Menu changes every 3-4 months so worth coming back again to try out other items according to what fresh and seasonal."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Bistro 67 on Friday night for our first time, and loved it. The restaurant was so cool and had a great view (we were overlooking the gardens where they grow their produce). The service and food was amazing. We started with the charcuterie board, which had a great variety (I'm vegetarian and it had lots for me - cauliflower, beets, smoked salmon, lots of cheeses - and a good variety of meats which my husband enjoyed). My husband had the jerk burger for dinner, which he said was good (but could have been spicier). I had the salmon, and it was the best salmon I've ever had, hands down. The value for the price was amazing too. I'd highly recommend Bistro 67 and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant in the culinary school at the UOIT. As such it has students of varying degrees of experience and talent serving and preparing the food. However, for the most part you would never know these weren't fully qualified staff with many years of experience. To add to the experience there are several TVs with a feed to various stations in the kitchen, so you can watch your meal being prepared. I liked this feature.

The food is presented like you're in an up-scale, fancy restaurant, but the prices are very reasonable, typically in the $12-15 range for a main entrée. I tried the meatloaf meatball pasta dish, which was a different take on a classic dish, and very tasty. A light, tangy tomato sauce with one huge spicy meatball stuffed with an egg. An interesting variation on a theme which was worth the price.

There is a private parking lot, for which parking is free, but you have to get a ticket validated by a cashier in the coffee shop downstairs. Presumably this is so that the campus students don't fill the lot with their cars.

This week there is a special cocktail called California On The Beach. It's a mix of cherry brandy, vodka and sprite. Very nice, and not too sweet. Perfectly balanced in my opinion.

This was our first visit to Bistro '67, but we will definitely go back."}
