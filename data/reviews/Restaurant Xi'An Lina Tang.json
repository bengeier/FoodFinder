{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, having discovered the wonders of Biang Biang noodles from Xi'an in New York. First the good news: the Biang noodles are good and the pulled pork burger looked tasty too. The problem was the lamb soup, which had an unpleasant gamey smell, tasteless tofu floating in it and a broth that was so salty it was inedible. The atmosphere here is run-down and the service is slow. Worth a trip for the Biang Biang noodles and burger. I wouldn't rush back."}
{"text":"The worst food I ate, ordered Liang Pi and Rou Jia Mo. Taste really sucks, cannot imagine their business  can survive with such ugly flavor. 

Regarding the service, No waitress is there to receive, you need to walk around and find someone to place the order, but they will appear when you check out to ask tips. 

Terrible experience ever, definitely won't come back!!!"}
{"text":"The noodle is too oily, and the Liangpi is not so orthodox.Overall, an ok resto."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located on the second floor so make sure you take the stairs if you cannot find the entrance. The menu is simple and offers all the classic Xian dishes like lamb soup (????) and pork buns (???). The dishes are authentic and flavourful, and the prices are fair for the portions. :)"}
{"text":"J'adore ce restaurant qui sert les nourritures de Xi'an! À absolument essayer: souper d'agneau avec petits morceaux de pain Mo, et le pain Mo avec porc mijoté!"}
{"text":"Have been there for two or three times. As I remember the service was slow. The waiter was focused on his cell phone instead of his job. 
According to my husband, if a restaurant is on a second floor with this many stairs, it has to be great to attract customers otherwise people won't come. This place failed for that. 
The taste and quality of food were not stable.  The lamb soup with bread soaked is a must try but it really depends on the mood of the chef. It's not just me, but my other two friends visited there separately also feel the same.  I also had steamed lamb shank slice dipped in garlic sauce. The portion    Was tiny, not worth the money. Hope they can improve.  I'd say the liang Pi and bun stuffed pork was OK, worthy a try. My friend who visited there recently thinks opposite. 
If you by any chance want to try a genuine Xi'an food, pray that the chef are doing his job right that day."}
{"text":"Really disappointed! I ordered oil-splashing noodles???, i thought it's not something difficult to cook, but unfortunately, the flavor is not good, the more important is they were too lazy to cook handmade noodles but used some normal one. Oh, NO! That definitely destroyed my appetite! When checking, I talked about this to the boss, he said I should told them for handmade noodles, or when they are busy they will use processed noodles instead. OKay, first, like Lanzhou noodles, they're supposed to be handmade. Then when I ordered no one asked me to do the choice. Finally, since I came in until I left total four customers there, including me, how come they were busy?! Anyway, I think This is a problem of attitude and service.  Won't come back again!"}
{"text":"Wow a xi'an restaurant in Montreal!!! From the lamb soup to the noddles all 5 stars. And u know me I am very harsh on chinese restaurant as I spend a lot of time in China and know my chinese food. 
The lamb with the Xian bread was so good. I do not eat bread but just had to cheat. It was nice and spicey. I ordered a second for my lunch tomorrow. 
Lamb noodle soup tastie and so authentic. Loved it. 
Finally the noodles with that unique xian taste. All so yummy. I will be back."}
