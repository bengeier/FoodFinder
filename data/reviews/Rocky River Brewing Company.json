{"text":"I am not really sure why this place gets such high reviews for the food. Ordered the burger and was shocked to find it is a frozen patty. Beer was good but I wont be back for the food."}
{"text":"Great family spot or place to watch a game. Service is always efficient and friendly. Food is outstanding everything seems to be made from scratch. In house smoked chicken or pulled pork street tacos are a must try. My other favorites are California chicken sandwich, blackened tuna Cobb salad and chicken ranch pizza. House brewed beers are very good. The blueberry beer is excellent and a good rotation of ipa's."}
{"text":"Checked in here last week to get a brew and bite while kids next door at Force center. I am at the Force a lot as I coach and play there. Would love for the brew co to work out but the service again was awful. I sat at the bar and had to yell after sitting there for 5 minutes without being greeted.   At least say hi be with you in a minute as you walk by 7 times. Literally I sat at the beer taps so I patiently waited before I said something. Then after finally getting a beer. Atasty IPA which was NOT theirs as they had no IPAs. What decent brewmaster has NO IPAs??  My wife came in anxious for a beer and some food. After sitting there another 7 minutes she said nice service and walked out.   Done done DONE with this place."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I was completely underwhelmed.  The beer list seemed limited.  The food was OK.  I had the Waldorf salad sandwich and it was everything I had hoped for, but nothing special.  Everything else about the experience was forgettable.  The last few times I've been up there though I found that I like the place a lot more.  Recently I went after costume shopping solely to try their monster mash brew.  The bartender was cool and the beer was fantastic.  It was a lot better than I thought it was going to be- not because I thought it would be horrible, but it's hard to make a standout pumpkin beer with things like Southern Tier Pumking running amok.  Super tasty.  Another time I went with my girlfriends.  The service, for lack of a better word, was: bitchy.  The food made up for the attitude though.  Sampling a bit of everything we all split queso dip, a bucket of burgers with beer battered fries, a Rueben on potato pancakes, and the meatloaf dinner.  Everything was delectable. The burgers were terrific and the fries were addicting.  Ruebens are a weakness of mine and this one was topnotch.  I'm a sucker for meatloaf and this one was one of the best I've ever had while dining out.  The portions are generous.  The interior of the place is pretty sweet.  Beer list is still pretty limited, but they do have $3 Margarita night....so they got that going for them."}
{"text":"What a great atmosphere and excellent food. I really enjoyed their craft beers. I am definitely a Coopers fan. I had the ribs during this latest visit and they were by far the best I have had in a long time. They also have a very nice patio in the back that is great for happy hour."}
{"text":"Well if you like waiting for 15 minutes with 0 acknowledgement from staff- this place is for you"}
{"text":"Best fries in town...when they have them!  Had dinner there on a Tues looking forward to and asking for extra fries. Meal arrived with very different fries. When I asked \"what happened to your fries?\" server answered \"we don't have our regular fries today.\"  Guess I went on the wrong day!"}
{"text":"RRBC has a good assortment of foods to pick from, with soups and salads, bar food, specialty pizzas, and sizeable entrees like salmon and pastas available. The beer is definitely better than your average bud light. I would say it's similar to Great Lakes. The service can be a bit lacking, but generally good. The inside seating is pretty dimly lit, so avoid the sunglasses. There is nice deck seating available in the summer with umbrellas for shade. Overall, a good place to relax after a long day."}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I agree that RRBC is awesome. We usually hate places full of big-screen sports, but the food, beer, and service more than make up for it. It's a hearty place -- go when you're hungry and craving a good beer.  The place can be loud on Fri-Sat night, or if there's a major sporting event going on. We tend to go later on Sundays, and it's fairly quiet & relaxed then. Same for weeknights.  Their beers are fantastic; awards cover the walls for a reason. I tend to like sweet brews (whites, wheats, scotch ales, bocks, some stouts), and they always have at least 1 or 2 that are downright delicious. The Subchaser Hefeweizen is my standby, but their Oatmeal Stout makes frequent appearances at my table too. I actually prefer their Christmas Ale over the Great Lakes one that dominates the region (which is great too, don't get me wrong) -- RRBC's has more brown sugar and a sweeter taste.  If you're a hops-addict, they always have plenty of heavily-bittered options for you as well, both from their own kettles and guest beers like Dogfishhead 60-min IPA. Actually, the only brews that have disappointed me are their reds, which really is one of my least preferred genres anyway.  The service has always been quite good in the 20 or so times we've visited. The waitstaff is full of hot girls, and they're actually nice too (shhh).  FOOD: Oddly enough for a \"brewpub\" I don't think I've ever ordered a burger or pizza. There's just no point when there's such a good variety of other options! Note: like so many places, they tend to over-season the french fries. I ask for them unsalted, and then they're good.   MUST-TRY:  Asian Nachos (appetizer) -- My girlfriend orders them every time. They're fried wanton wrappers covered in marinated chicken, mozzarella, thai sweet/hot sauce, and a mild wasabi glaze. They disappear fast!  Eldorado Enchiritos -- The blend of chorizo, chicken, and cheese inside is mighty tasty. Great as leftovers too. If you can't decide, order this.  Pacific Beach Tacos -- Super fresh, perfect for a summer day on the patio. I recommend the cod if you like fish at all; it's great with the mango salsa.  Cooper's Baby Back Ribs -- OMG these are my favorite ribs ever. Marinated in beer, so they fall off the bone. No, really, I eat them *entirely* with a fork! They even have a spicier chipotle BBQ sauce available now. This is making me hungry.   Other Good Stuff:  Johnny Mac 'n' Three Cheeses --  Seems a little overpriced for mac & cheese, but it's a big portion. Mixed in are andouille sausage, red peppers, and scallions.  Fin's Tuna Tacos -- It's a smaller meal, but much classier than you'd expect for this sort of venue. If you want lightly garnished slabs of tuna that fall apart in your mouth, you'll be delighted.  Chicken Waldorf Salad Sandwich -- Exactly what is should be: a pile of delicious on a croissant.  Chipotle BBQ Chicken Sandwich -- I got two juicy chicken breasts when I ordered it, and no shortage of mozzarella, banana peppers, or sauce. I didn't think I could be impressed by a chicken sandwich, but RRBC did it."}
{"text":"Nice classic looking bar/restaurant with comfortable seating. Service was friendly and fast, although I did visit around 1pm.    Christmas Ale was tasty, and I recommend the Asian nachos, but you may want to pass on the potato pancake reuben, as it's impossible to actually pick up. With so many bars like this in western Cleveland, you really red to stand out, and this didn't break the mold."}
{"text":"Nice place to take kids for a much better experience in service and food quality and selection than the chains.  Seems like a great place to watch a ballgame as well.  Always a good spot.  Wish the Underhill steak sandwich was still on menu"}
{"text":"Love the place, great food and good beer. They need to add more taps for guest beers and widen their selection is the only advice I have."}
{"text":"Stopped in to RRBC for lunch on a Saturday. They've got a nice lunch menu, which was far nicer than I expected for a brewing company. Ended up eating on the patio, which was surprisingly nice. They have an outdoor bar, which looked pretty cool, but wasn't open at the time.  The food was excellent! Awesome fries, beating out Melt in Lakewood (they're really that good). My girlfriend had a French dip, which she thought was the best she'd ever had. I ended up getting the chicken arugula sandwich with Gouda and a garlic aioli sauce. The taste was incredible.   Since they're a brewing company, I decided to try one of their homebrews (the blueberry ale). It exceeded expectations, though the price was around $4. The selection isn't huge (a la Beer Engine), but it's much better than you'll find most places. Nice options, and more care put into the beer menu than I expected.  So why 4 stars? Our waitress. My girlfriend and I got one glass of water each. For the whole meal. Aside from when she took our order, and brought our food and check, we didn't see her. I can only imagine how busy she must have been with her two tables at noon on a Saturday (we were one of three tables there), but a little more care and attention would have been nice. It's hard to flag down someone you don't see. The girl who was clearing off tables paid more attention to us.   Who knows, maybe our waitress was new? It was just subpar service, which marred an otherwise outstanding experience. Thankfully, I don't think poor service is the norm there. The girlfriend and I plan to go back soon."}
{"text":"The owner saved us many gas miles after my husband left his credit card at the restaurant when he and our daughter stopped for lunch on their way from Connecticut to Ann Arbor, Michigan. My husband didn't discover he had forgotten the credit card until they had arrived in Ann Arbor. He was on his way back to Cleveland to retrieve the card when I suggested I call the restaurant and see if they would overnight the card. The owner was most agreeable, and very helpful in doing just that. We were all very grateful as this was already a stressful trip for my daughter, who was travelling to be with her dear friend during breast cancer surgery. I didn't tell the owner that fact, he is just a very good guy. By the way, my husband and daughter really enjoyed the food and beer, too."}
{"text":"WHAT A MESS. They do not take reservations and the hostess' are totally clueless, not to mention rude! If you have a party of 2 or more on the weekends, do not come here, because you will wait 2 hours, even if you did call ahead, multiple times! HORRIBLE first impression, RR brew co! Hire some hostesses who know how to handle a crowd -- and start taking reservations!"}
{"text":"Four stars for food and service, the beer production is a different story . Personally I do not enjoy local micro breweries. It seems like the U.S. Just figured out that you can add actual flavor to beers, and brew masters are going overboard .   The RRBC is a fun local brewery with a great menu and experienced staff . ( the high school hostesses can be bitchy and seem annoyed by customers) . I have been going here a little over three years, and overall it is a fun experience !   Different daily specials are reasonable and well prepared . My favorite specials are the bucket wing night, 5$ pizza, and the 12$ steak and beer night. Also the burgers, soups, appetizers, and dinner plates have never disappointed me .  The patio during the summer time is fun, and adds more seating! Definitely anticipate a large crowd during weekend dinner times and any popular sporting events.   Like I said, the beer making is the weakest aspect. It is not bad, but also not good . Hope to see improvements for the future."}
{"text":"We came here for the 2nd time last week after the first two restaurants we tried were closed on Mondays. I was pretty disappointed with my meal here both times.  Our first visit, we had the Thai chicken rolls which I remember being good but nothing that will forever stand out in my memory or compel me to order them again. My husband ordered ribs which were really, really good and I had the one potato, two potato grouper which was greasy and pretty flavorless. The fries were good, coleslaw not so much. Overall an ok experience since we both liked the beer.   This time around, we both got burgers (mine was the blue cheese, husband got the bacon barbeque one). We ordered both medium and they came out WAY past well done. Just like the burgers I remember my dad burning, err....grilling as a child (not a pleasant memory). Fries were good (standard for a bar/grill). Really, the only saving grace for this meal was the chicken queso appetizer we ordered which was SO good!! No drinks this time so I can't speak to that but overall we have had about a 25% success rate with our entrees. Probably won't be back unless it's for appetizers and/or ribs and a drink."}
{"text":"Love their burger deals -- I usually go to RRBC on Tuesday nights to take advantage of their $6 (used to be $5) burger specials, and I've never been disappointed with any of the burgers I've ordered.  I think I've tried them all, and most recently, the Raging Bull burger (jalapeños, pepperjack cheese, an onion ring, and chipotle ketchup) was a rich treat.  Their fries are really good too, and they offer a generous helping with each plate.  Their beer selection is nice.  I haven't had beers there that have made me want to buy them in bulk (like I have with Great Lakes), but I've definitely enjoyed them and think that they have a decent mixture for a microbrewery."}
{"text":"Beer is very decent. Food is interesting. I've ordered a hamburger here twice. The first time I asked \"medium rare\" and got a well done burger. I gave the benefit of the doubt and a few weeks later ordered a second burger. This time I asked for rare (emphasized it twice) and it came out well done. Four stars for beer. 2.5 for food. If you can't cook a burger to order, that's kind of sad."}
{"text":"Right away I was greeted with a smile.  I asked to sit on the deck out back so I could see the baseball game on TV. The hostess sat me at a table that had not been cleaned since the last guest.  I can look past that,  and glad I did. The beer was awesome,  and the food fantastic.  The Raging Bull Burger was every bit the part!  Spicy and hot,  just the way I like it.  Servitude was fast, and very friendly. As an out of towner who eats out a lot,  I recommend this place."}
{"text":"RRBC is our spot.  The food is consistently delicious, the service is fast and friendly, the price is perfect, and the micro-brews are awesome.  They  have addictive beer battered fries.  We love going up on Tuesday for their $5 burger night where you can get awesome burgers with fries for only-you guessed it-$5. They have really cool appetizers such as Asian nachos, and buffalo egg rolls.  Besides the delicious food, the drinks are great! George, one of the bartenders, can make some of the best Mojitos in town. They have an awesome patio in the summer which makes a great place to go out with some friends and chill out on any night."}
{"text":"Went out to Rocky River Brewing Company for dinner with the family on a Friday night, great place to be. The wait was no long at all for a table, but the bar seemed pretty busy with very few spots left. When you walk in you see the brewing equipment which is always fun to look at. We ate inside but the patio they have is huge and has an outdoor bar as well.  The waitress was very nice and helpful, and came around often to make sure we were doing okay.  I order the pepperoni pizza, which comes with no sauce, but you can ask for sauce if you want, I would recommend trying it without the sauce because there is so much pepperoni on the pizza you won't even care if there is sauce or not.  The beer selection is limited to about 7 of the brewing company's beer on tap with about 4 \"Guest Beers.\" The brew is pretty decent. I order the Got Hop IPA and the Cooper's Gold, both were cold, smooth and great tasting. According to them they have won a couple of brewing awards.  The price at the end of the day was great. For four of us with about one to two beers each and a meal it was only around 60 bucks, which I add is a VERY good price. I would recommend this place to someone looking to have some local micro brew and good brewpub food."}
{"text":"OVERALL: Food is better than other local brewpubs, beer is not as good. Service was awesome.  BEER: The Blueberry Ale was good... not as good as Fat Head's Bumbleberry, in my opinion. Monster Mash was a little better.   FOOD: Pretzel crusted chicken was AMAZING. I would go back just for this. Boyfriend got Jambalaya... it seemed okay from the bite I had.  SERVICE: We sat at the bar and service was prompt, efficient, and personable."}
{"text":"Their Reuben is one of the best I've had in a long time. The potato pancake really sets it off. Friendly staff and great location. One of our new staples"}
{"text":"Mine and my husband food could have been prepared better by my culinary challenged Mother. My potatoes were dry and luke warm while my husbands jumbayla as unevenly heated, some parts hot enough to burn his mouth. The server was more interested in the game on the tv then what food was actually on the menu. To make the place even more entertaining the screech of children was heard through out our meal.  There is pub food that is great and worth the aggregation of unchecked children and multiple games blaring, it's just not here."}
{"text":"\"Wow! We dine out a lot, we like to try new places, and we haven't been this impressed in a LONG time! The food was SO, so fantastic. It was so good I ate every last bite, which is unusual for me - I almost always have to box my leftovers.  I had the pretzel crusted chicken, and my husband had the potato grouper.  Both dishes were just outstanding, and our server was excellent as well.  We made it a point to ask for the manager to compliment the food and service.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Our server was so out of it. If she wasn't so young I would've swore she was having a stroke every time we tried to give her our order.  We had the the artichoke and portobello dip and it came out looking like a pile of crappy oat meal. We gave up and paid for out drinks and eat elsewhere"}
{"text":"I had an awful experience at RRBC and I will never return again. Unfortunately, this was one of my favorite places to go, they have great food and beer. Yesterday I was there on a Sunday afternoon. The CAVS were about to play and I was excited about Kyrie returning. I asked the bartender if they could switch one of the TV's to show the CAVS games. All the TV's were displaying football games. The bartender went back and asked her manager for permission to change the channel. She got the ok, so I decided to stay and ordered food and a beer. Not to long after, a few gentlemen were upset that the TV's were switched to the CAVS game. They are all wanted to watch the Browns game, which had not even started yet. The owner came out yelling asking who wanted to watch the CAVS and seemed very upset. I felt extremely uncomfortable. My friend and I were not the only people who requested to watch the CAVS game. If it was a problem, I would have just left to another bar with no problem. They made us feel terrible. To top it off, the gentleman next to me was practically screaming in my ear and was in my person space. He then asked if I could move down a seat so a buddy of his could sit with him, and I told him no because the only TV displaying the CAVS games was in front of me and I did not want to move and not be able to see the game. I was there first and should not have to move. As soon as I said no the man got upset and was very rude to me. Starting talking bad about me to his friends and called me names. It was just unacceptable. After all that the owner and the older men at the bar kept talking crap about us wanting to watch the CAVS vs the Browns. Last time I checked the CAVS is a winning team and the Browns are not. I love Cleveland sports and if there was not a CAVS game on, I would have been happy to watch the Browns game. As I sat there trying to enjoy my meal, I felt horrible and uncomfortable. I even lost my appetite. Like I said this is a great place, but unfortunately, I will no longer give them my business. It may not be much money they lose, but I hope other people read this and decide not to go as well. I feel as though the owner should not have treated us that way. You are there to run a business and make your customers happy, not make them feel like crap. Perhaps it had to do with the fact that I am a woman, who knows. Again, I will never ever return to this place again."}
{"text":"Service at the bar is great. Pretty good food. Their Christmas ale is very flavorful. You can taste more spices in this Christmas ale."}
{"text":"1/29/16 The one negative comment I have is that even though we called ahead and were told we'd have to wait 15 minutes, we still ended up waiting 30 minutes. Though it seemed like everybody and their mother we're out to dinner that night (it was our third restaurant we tried that wasn't an hour wait). Despite the busy atmosphere our server was very nice and always had a smile on her face. The menu had so many yummy options it was difficult to chose! Went with Johnny's three Mac and cheese. Large portion to take some home. In house brewed beer was very good as well. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food was very good and promptly served. A good value for the money."}
{"text":"PROS: Good food, good beers, well priced, comfortable atmosphere.  Nice outdoor deck in the summer.  CONS: can't think of any"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! Great workers here that always take care of you. Incredible food and beers. I either go with what the special of the day is or the meatloaf and nothing ever disappoints. The pretzel crusted chicken is also fantastic. Never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"Rocky River Brewing Company is one of my favorites! I have been here on many occasions and the food has been consistent while the service is always pleasant. Our servers have been engaging and helpful when it comes to food choices and suggestions. The menu is large, making it easy to try something new every time you come. The restaurant is kid friendly and can easily accommodate large groups. I suggest trying the pesto and pita appetizer, it's melt in your mouth amazing!"}
{"text":"Just stopped here for a quick lunch. The entrance was a little confusing, but we quickly realized that we were walking through the brewery which was super cool. Our waitress was super friendly. I got the chipotle bbq chicken sandwich and the bbq pork sandwich. Both were delicious and good sized portions for the price and those fries! The menu said they were homemade beer battered fries and they were amazing! I also got one of their house brewed beers on tap which was also good and the pricing is more than reasonable on a pint! I was extremely pleased with our entire experience and we will be going back often!"}
{"text":"Yay...went today for the Christmas Ale!!!! so yummy and warming for Christmas in July...we also got lucky b/c today is $6 Burger nite...any burger on the menu not  just the basic cheeseburger...always a bonus. I had the RRBC Bacon Cheddar Burger and my husband had Raging Bull burger, the chipotle ketchup was great :) we enjoyed our burgers and fries with a great side of Christmas Ale. Get there while it lasts."}
{"text":"I think the best thing this place had going for it was cute bar tenders and dudes sitting at the bar on the patio outside.  The wait staff, while moderately friendly, seemed not in any kind of rush to be of service. Another reviewer hit it on the head with the word 'clueless,' I think.   It can sometimes be a bad sign when you can find Mexican, Asian, and typical American choices on the same menu. And sure enough, the food was absolutely mediocre.    My portabella burger was not bad, but if I'm paying for food, I would not want to waste my money here again. Too many other restaurants to try. I think the right word for RRBC is forgettable. Nothing was terrible, it was just forgettable.   The beers were fine, but I can also think of a million other places I'd rather go to have a bigger selection of better-tasting beers."}
{"text":"We arrived at RRBC about an hour after they opened on a Sunday, we were somewhat greeted by the hostess, who just seemed irritated that she needed to assist customers. We were two of about three other small parties in the place...not busy at all.  My annoyance of the hostess's disinterest in us quickly dissipated once our server arrived at our table. Probably the best part of our experience at this place. She was very nice and very attentive. She was quick to place our orders and check up on us, at the same time gave us the space we needed to eat our food without having someone constantly asking us if we needed anything else.  Food orders:  I ordered the RRBC Bacon-Cheddar Burger - named as one of their favorites on the menu. So I thought this would have to be a good choice.  The bacon (Applewood smoked) was overcooked, tasted like plastic and was so hard that when bit into it I felt like I was going to break a tooth. The burger itself was okay, but the bacon was inedible.  My boyfriend ordered the California Chicken Sandwich (grilled chicken with avocado and pepper jack cheese). The chicken was overcooked so kind of tough. The best part of it was the avocado (very fresh and flavorful) and the cheese.  Beer orders: Subchaser Hefe-Weizen, hefewiezens are one of my favorite types of beer, this one was pretty decent, but I've definitely had better.  And the Hop Goblin (American IPA).  This one was really good, it reminded me of the Citramax at Market Garden Brewery (which is also an American IPA).  I am not sure if I'll be back here...perhaps if I am in the area during lunch/dinner I may give it a second try."}
{"text":"Saturday night out and we opted for RRBC.  We had been there before for their beer after the dinner crowd was gone, but wanted to check out the food.  Very loud and crowded at the bar.  I am sure the back patio alleviates this in the warmer months.  Beers were very good and the selection will meet anyone's palette.    Food?  Not impressed.  Started with the Riccotta Pesto dip that has pita drizzled with balsamic reduction.  Lacked taste and needed something.  Friends had the Asian tacos and loved them.  They considered getting another plate but didn't.  I did not have any since they were gone so quickly.  I had the salmon with asparagus risotto that was no different than I would get anywhere else.  Wife had the chicken tacos and only ate one.  Dry and no flavor.  Brought them home and they are still in the fridge.  Friends had the beer cheese soup and thought it was very good.    So, if you are looking for good craft beers with a nice selection, this is the place.  If you are primarily looking for food or a quiet atmosphere I might not recommend.  I would like to try this when they weren't so busy and see if it makes a difference.  Side note:  Any time we have come here later in the evening for just drinks I can tell you that the bartenders have been some of the finest.  Great service, knowledgeable about their craft products and personable."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Rocky River Brewing on several occasions. The first couple of times were great and the food was terrific! However, my most recent experiences including the one tonight, have forced me to write negatively about this establishment. I recently went during a lunch break with a coworker and we waited 45+ minutes for a salad and a wrap. We were forced to eat our food very quickly and barely got to enjoy it. Talk about slow service!!  Tonight I ordered take out for dinner on my way home from work and specifically asked the hostess over the phone if they have take out to double check what I saw listed on the website. I gave her my order and my contact information, which she wrote down (or seemed to be writing it down). She confirmed my order with me and told me it would take 20-30 minutes. When I arrived I walked up to three hostesses and let them know I was there for a to-go order. None of them were of any help and told me to head to the bar. When I asked the bartender he said that there was no order under my name. When I concluded there may be some kind of mistake and it could possibly be under another name, he became very rude and said that they had not received any take out calls all night and acted like it was my fault that the order was not in. They said I could put the order in again but then I would have to wait another 30 minutes.  I feel that the service has fallen off lately and instead of hiring a bunch of people to stand around the hostess table and not do their job they should be focusing more on the customer."}
{"text":"I really like this place the ribs were fantastic and the service was very good. I also like the sinks in the bathroom."}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch a game or just relax and hang out with friends. I really liked the twist on the tradition spinach artichoke dip! Also the mash potatos are great. Next time I go I want to try the pretzels. :)"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years! The food is great and the fries are incredible! I'm not a beer drinker and neither is my husband...we just love the food!! They have gluten free options which is wonderful for our dear friends and with my dairy allergies I know they have always been great about mixing things up for me!!"}
{"text":"I unfortunately don't understand the hype about the food from this restaurant. I personally didn't find it to be very satisfying. We were told we HAD to try the Asian nachos and how people only come for the Asian nachos. So I tried them and I was not a fan. I didn't think there was much chicken for the price you pay and the wasabi drizzle overpowered everything. My friends ordered the burger buckets and we think the burgers could use a crunch of a pickle but the fries were great. I was happy with the Chicken Salad sandwich but that would not necessarily bring me back. I would come back for the beer. I think they have a decent variety and the prices are good.   If you plan on visiting try to come on a weekday as the place gets crazy loud and packed on the weekends. We came at about 8pm on a Saturday and if we didn't snag a place at the bar the wait would have been an hour !"}
{"text":"Went here with a few co-workers for happy hour yesterday.  We were anticipating the patio since it's been in the 70's for over a week, but it wasn't open so that was a bummer.  We all shared apps or buckets and everything was pretty good.  I got the blueberry beer which was good also, and they had a 23oz for the price of a pint on Thursdays.    The service was pretty eh.  The waitress seemed annoyed, and didn't bring waters unless each person asked.  Maybe I'll give it another shot this summer."}
{"text":"Awesome place for date night! Especially if you're going to a movie because AMC is right across the street. Great beers, good prices, great service."}
{"text":"Okay, full disclosure, I have been here a thousand times but have never written a review. I am originally from Cleveland but have not lived here since the early 90's. If the RRBCo were in Chicago, NY, San Francisco you would never be able to get in. After reading a lot of reviews I think people are spoiled here by not having to wait at very many places for a table. Well, welcome to the rest of the world, you may have to wait to find a seat at the bar, table or their totally awesome deck or island bar.   Now, on to the food. Every time I come here the menu has something new on it. They keep it fresh and their chef is always experimenting with new items. I love their smoked tacos, the Jonny Mac and cheese, but most recently I started off with the hand made tater tots with bacon (holy cow and marriage made in heaven) and the Siracha Honey wings. I am still smiling from the meal that I finished more than an hour ago.   The staff here is awesome. They do get busy but they always do their best.   Lastly, the BrewCo could easily raise their prices but they don't. The owners are family oriented and want a place that can get a family in and out without breaking the bank.   Cheers to all the fans as I hoist my coopers gold."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of the beer selection here, but the food is good and the patio out back is pretty nice in the summer and for happy hour."}
{"text":"Their website takes reservations, but not in the same day? Thats what I was told when I called. They said they have call ahead seating. Fine, I will take that. When we arrived we were told your table is ready, but since your other guests are not here you have to wait. After 10 min. they decided to let us sit at our table. Yea, gotta fix that guys.  Our service was great! The staff was friendly, we had 3 staff members checking on us. Yes, thanks Yelpers, the Asian Nachos were great! The beer was also wonderful, no yeast smell when we entered the place. Thats good. I have not been here in a few years. The food has improved from the last time we were here.  They work hard and they got it right, in spite of the reservation issue. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went here over the past weekend. The inside is beautiful, open and clean. I love all the wood work. I was not impressed with the little amount of craft beers they have. Is say only about 8. The menu is a bit large which can be a bit overwhelming when trying to order food. The fried pickles were amazing. The steak was a little under cook but overall you get what you pay for. The potato crusted grouper was great. I think they should put the side dish options below the entrees though. Seeing as I didn't know all my options till after the fact. Our waitress was great. Very nice girl. Would return for the pizza and to watch a game. But probably not for dinner."}
{"text":"Went there with a group to watch basketball and have a few drinks . No seats at the bar and plenty of empty tables in bar so we took one. Very young and immature hostess told us we would have to leave the table if we were not going to eat there, we said no seats at bar and all these empty tables it was about 9:00 dinner hour over, she said there policy was you had to eat at the table if you wanted to sit there.We left and will not be back! Moral of story if you just want to stop in for a drink with a group of friends  Don't Go There!!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!! From southwestern PA, just passing through. Girlfriend found this place online as we like trying different brews. What a gem!!! An amazing vegetarian, even vegan (and gf, although that's not our thing), options. We both had tacos. They have two vegetarian types and neither included beans. How fabulous. I'd go the 2 hours out to Cleveland just to eat and drink there. The beer was pretty tasty too. Sad I can't write a better review on that because it was a lunchtime visit, but I'm sure we'll be enjoying the growler we took to go later on."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this joint, one of my new faves in #CLE.  All I will say is that these guys Know their Sh*t.   Their stouts, porters are Nasty good. But in general, it just depends on mood -- they're all top notch.   Now, for the Grub:  1) Fried Pickles House pickles, beer battered and deep fried, served with a cajun remoulade.  The sauce is wicked.  2) Asian Nachos Thai-marinated chicken, mozzarella cheese and wasabi sour cream atop crispy won tons  Entree ( only downside was you only get 2 for $14 smackers. 3-4 Qty would be nice, even if the portions were smaller...)  Fin's Tuna Tacos Ponzu marinated yellowfin tuna in 2 flour tortillas; topped with wasabi-cucumber slaw, fresh avocado & cilantro. Served with a side of cilantro black beans.   They cook it medium unless you're a LionFish like me, and demand it Mid-Rare.   Do It. No regrets."}
{"text":"Not going back. We've eaten here twice and had some lackluster experiences. The first time our food was okay but our service was slow. Thought it was just due to a busy night so we gave it another chance.   The second is what solidified our decision. First we were seated in a small section where there was a party of ~12 people, half of which were screaming children ages 7-10. It was so obnoxious we couldn't hear each other talk and we asked to be moved. Our waitress was very polite and attentive, but the food took forever. We got queso for an appetizer and it took ~20 minutes for them to bring it. Our food came by only 5 minutes later causing the predicament of \"which one do I let go cold?\". My fiancé's pizza was very undercooked and he had to send it back. It took them 15 minutes to make a new one and I had already finished eating by that time. They offered a free beer to make up for the issue. The only thing I can say was phenomenal was the giant cookie we had for dessert. It was very rich and gooey.   Like I said, not going back again. Not worth our time when we can have much better food in a much shorter amount of time."}
{"text":"1st. time back after boycotting the place a few years ago.   Well things don't seem to change.   Ordered extra crisp garlic wings with Parmesan,  it's on the menu with ranch and celery.   I got greasy, no Parmesan, overall not very well seasoned and worse off all undercooked and bloody wings.   They were kind enough to comp me my beer!   NEVER again!"}
{"text":"Asparagus and goat cheese quesadilla was fantastic - light, different, semi healthy -  great patio atmosphere for a rare sunny Cleveland days - service was a bit off but the more mojitos I had, the less I cared!"}
{"text":"Bucket of Burgers!  Rocky River Brewing Company is a smaller brewery in suburban Cleveland, nestled in the midst of Rocky River.    Unlike other brewing companies, there were seats available on Friday, hence the ability to hang out and eat.   We ordered a sampler of beers:  Of those, I was a fan of the Blueberry Beer and all of the darker beers, but the Pirate Light was really eh (my Dad was not a fan of the Blueberry beer... too much of an aftertaste).  Sadly the Christmas ale was out.  As for food, I ordered a bucket of burgers.  5 sliders for $9 is a good deal.  They also provide a good deal of fries (like, 5 Guys levels of fries).    Overall, it's a nice place to grab some food.  It's relaxed, there's a Pac-Man/Galaga machine, and it's a nice place to eat.  Stick with the darker beers as well."}
{"text":"Great beer and great burgers. Try the Hoptimus Prime before it's gone. The RRBC hit a homerun with this beer. Just as good as Firestone's Doublejack, which is one of the best Double IPAs. A great restaurant."}
{"text":"We visited here for dinner on busy Sunday with my In-Laws for  a birthday.  The hostess greeted us at the door and after a short wait, we went to  our table.  Portobello artichoke dip was very good but was  served in a tilted bowl which is stupid if you're trying to share.  It was served with corn and flour tortilla chips.   I love peanut butter and was pleased by the Punchin the Nuts Amber Ale's light peanut butter taste. I attempted to sneak by and requested it as the Nuts Amber Ale since we were at dinner with my In-Laws. However, the server caught me and I had to say the full name. My  husband likes their blueberry beer. Their beers are smooth, not overly hoppy.  I've heard rumors that their Christmas Ale is better than the Other Christmas Ale.   The Pacific Beach Tacos with cod were surprisingly good. The flour tortillas were crisp. The mango salsa was just right with a touch of sour cream. Blackened tuna steak sandwich was well seasoned. Beer battered steak fries were good accompaniment but average. The Mac n Cheese was a hearty portion of  tomato cream cheese sauce, noodles, roasted red peppers, tomatoes and sausage that had a slight kick. I've had it without the sausage and it is worth every carb.   Service was attentive, relaxed, and efficient. The bar service was very good even though the place was packed.   We went back a week later with a larger group and the quality in food, beer, and service was equally as good."}
{"text":"Amazing place.  Great food, large selection of food amd beer.  Kid friendly also.  We brought the whole family"}
{"text":"Probably not awful but other places in the area have set my bar for bars to high. Similarly priced to the Melt or Fatheads, but not as much choice and not as high of quality. Not much of a beer person, but they had a blueberry something that I was hoping was as good at Fathead's Bumbleberry.  It was not. I had a BBQ chicken sandwich.  Nothing special. I think, despite description to the contrary, that it was just some off the shelf sauce. Got chorizo empanadas for an appetizer.  Not super appetizing."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my trip to RRBC a lot less this time.  While there were PLENTY of employees on site, they appear to have been hired for their physical assets rather than any service ability.  If I wanted that I could go to Hooters."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite go-to restaurant! They have a delicious menu, great beers on tap, and very kid friendly! Service is always on point and the atmosphere is loud and fun!"}
{"text":"The blueberry ale was a great summer brew -- clean, light and cold just the way you'd want it.  Ever had a fried pickle -- theirs are good ones!  The fried pickles were typical of pub food but lots of dill pickle and little of the fried stuff so thumbs up.  Oh the spicy remoulade was great with the pickles.  I had the grouper sandwich served with fries which was fine but a lot of fried for this girl so I wish I'd gone with the salad which get high marks from my friends and from the server.  The gut is only meant to have one fried item in a meal as far as I'm concerned.    Next visit I'll stick with beer and apps.  Service was good and the deck was a perfect spot on a summer afternoon.  The draft beer list was more limited that I expected but a nice range.  I'd come back for beer but no so much for a meal as it stand now but maybe I'll give dinner another whirl and see what the verdict is."}
{"text":"Interestingly enough, the beer's not the draw for us; the food is.  They have great sandwich-and-burger style meals with a twist, and I'd highly recommend their Asian nachos, which come with chicken, cheese, and a lightly-spiced wasabi.  They have great pretzels.  Their salads are surprisingly good.   The beer?  Decent.  Like most local brewpubs they adore hops to the point of bitter beer face, but it's Cleveland beer.  About what you'd expect.  But the Brew Company as a whole is rarely disappointing."}
{"text":"Slammin as always. Burger, wrap, entre or salad. Always decadent and we'll portioned. Heavy pours for happy hour definitely sells more food. Never a bad experience,  if something isn't to your liking, they make it right. Don't go if you're on a diet."}
{"text":"This would get a four star from us strictly just for the food and atmosphere but their beerand service is nothing to write home about. Don't let the few medals on their walls fool you. Most are poorly executed. As far as the food, it usually never disappoints. Don't get me wrong, their have been a few times when they are busy the food gets a little below par for them, but I suppose that will happen if staff gets overwhelmed.  To make a quick review, I hope you get a server who actually seems like they appreciate what they are doing, and that you stick with drinks other than theirs. By following these steps, you should be in for a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but not life changing. I got the mac n cheese. I've heard the pretzel crusted chicken is good, If I return I'll probably get that. The inside of this place is cool and I like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really love this place! absolutely beautiful the establishment is very clean and the staff is prompt and friendly food menu is unreal it's still a bar menu but we found it very different than most bars.  we had the Asian nachos which came out very pleasing to the eyes and tasted amazing what a great twist to nachos and the beer is also excellent"}
{"text":"Service cam be slow, but the food is very good! The burgers are good, the beer battrred fries and awesome and it always clean."}
{"text":"I was pleased with this place (which had nothing to do with the young waitress winking at me as I walked by). And I wish I had been hungrier as the menu was very inviting.  First of all, huge props for having HUGE samplers. Seriously, some of the largest beer samplers I have ever had. And there were 7 of them. And secondly, huge props for having good beers. And not your typical beers either. A blueberry pale ale, a barleywine that was light in color with almost a hefe flavor, etc. I was quite happy (or hoppy).  And then there was the food. I had an extremely difficult time deciding what to order. As per usual, I felt compelled to go with the wings. But these \"wings\" were pork wings, not chicken - and you had the option of jerk or chipolte (I opted for chipolte). The wings came with a cup of beans with bacon and pineapple, which excited me. I also opted for a side of french fries with ranch.   The \"wings\" did not disappoint. They were yummy, saucy pork goodness just falling off the bone. I practically \"oohed\" out loud. I asked for a side of blue cheese, just to taste. Honestly, I should not have bothered. It tasted like icky, watery ranch. However, the ranch that came with the fries was absolutely delectable. It was like ranch with a yummy tang with some garlic. Definitely house-made and quite delicious. And the beans that came with the \"wings\" were heavenly. The bacon and pineapple mixed in made for quite the yummy combo. Thoroughly enjoyable.  So yeah, a pretty great experience. I appreciate the beers and enjoyed the food. The place itself was ok. Definitely glad I got in before the dinner rush. I would definitely opt for a repeat visit should I ever be in the area again."}
{"text":"After two back to back terrible experiences at RRBC, I won't be back. Friday night, we drop in for an after work drink. The bar was crowded, so we asked the teen hostess about sitting at the two top adjacent to the bar. We were told it was reserved. When we asked about another table, we were rudely asked if we intended to order food and not just drinks. We decided to leave.  The next night, we returned only because our friend was hungry after the movies, and we didn't want to go far or to a chain restaurant. A different young lady at the hostess stand again asked us very abruptly if we were going to order food because tables are only for dining. Some context- neither I nor our anyone in my party look anything like the types who take up a table for hours and order one beer each or just one app and drink waters. Do those types of people even frequent this bar? The typical crowd is 35 year old+, nose in the air yuppies from \"River\". It's not a Denny's. I find it hard to believe this is a chronic problem.   Exasperatedly, I told her yes, we intend to eat and spend more than the minimum amount of money required to be seated at their fine establishment. At about 10p the restaurant was about half empty but the bar was full. I had to wonder if they turned away and/or turned off any potential customers who might have wanted a beer at a quiet table but didn't feel like eating.   Overall the food is ok (a little better recently) and the beers are acceptable but not anywhere near GLBC, Market Garden, or Platform. Their patio is nice on warm days but it's not nice enough to have to endure rude hostesses and to be interrogated about what I am going to order the second I step into a restaurant."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch with my parents. We were seated promptly and greeted by our waitress. We promptly received drinks, and ordered an appetizer and our meals. The appetizer we got was amazing - pesto ricotta dip. We all loved it. For meals, I got meatloaf with mashed potatoes. This might be the best meatloaf I've ever had in a restaurant. It was served with a demi glace and broccoli. It was awesome. Husband ordered Shrimp and grits, and he said it was delicious. It came with andouille sausage and looked good. My mother had buffalo egg rolls for her meal, and she loved them. My father had the fish sandwich and he said it was awesome. We all agreed we'll definitely be back for more meals!!"}
{"text":"Nice large menu selection and a nice atmosphere. There are options for everyone here and I felt everything was reasonably priced. Today I had the chicken sliders (in a bucket) that came with a large portion of fries. My dining  partner had the buffalo  chicken pizza. Both meals were delicious! I will come back to try more menu items. We had very friendly service. FYI, there is not a ton of parking."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while and was met by one of the rudest hostesses I've ever encountered. Miss Maddie needs to be fired! The bartender Rory was very nice and accommodating. That wasn't enough to make me come back. There are too many good places to go with better beer and service."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the food and the beer.  Seems like it best to get here early as it does have a tendency to get pretty busy."}
{"text":"Much improved from what I recall. I had the grilled tuna salad, and sampled a few of their beers.  My dinner companion had the taco salad. It looked typical, and she said it was tasty.  Salad was very tasty, and a nice size. Tuna was perfectly medium rare. Everything was a good quality, and seemed fresh.  The beer is mediocre.  No taste sensations or surprises. Safe.   The ambiance was nice, and service was decent. Nothing award winning here...but all in all, pleasant.  I will definitely return, as it is close, and sometimes Fat Head's is just too far a hike."}
{"text":"Not many gluten free options for my friend. GREAT BEER."}
{"text":"RRBC is my go-to restaurant. Great atmosphere inside and out. The staff is friendly and very accommodating.  It would be nice if they updated their online homepage including events."}
{"text":"Tonight was my 3 rd time at this restaurant: good service, energetic ambiance, decent beer but food has consistently been mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Flew into Cleveland and immediately looked at Yelp for a brew pub (love trying local beers). This place was about 3 miles from the airport so my trusty GPS & I headed here. Porter was good, but amber is amazing...brewed with peanut butter!  I ordered the pretzel crusted baked chicken...pretty damn delicious.  It usually comes with mashed potatoes (which I should have opted for) but I went with rice.  Rice I didn't care for at all, but I loved the chicken.  The service was amazing and the atmosphere was very welcoming and relaxed.  They treated an out-of-towner like family."}
{"text":"Oh, don't make me hate you...  THE UP-SIDE:  For some reason, I wanna hate this place.  And yet, I cannot.  Every single time I have been here I have enjoyed the food and beer.  And every single one of those times I find myself thinking, \"Why do I always think I'm gonna hate this place?  It's pretty good.\"    THE DOWN-SIDE: It's not fine dining.  Just a bar with some good food.  THE SUM-IT-UP: A great place to hang with friends and enjoy some pretty good food."}
{"text":"An absolute staple. Great beer. Love grabbing a burger and beer here. Always friendly and the kids love the fries."}
{"text":"Rocky River Brewing Company is a good pic for lunch. We stopped by the RRBC on a Sunday for a bit to eat and were very pleased with the service and had a decent bar food lunch. There is plenty of parking onsite, access could be a bit difficult for some due to sloped driveway and parking lot. The vibe is right for a brewery with large brew kettles and tanks well displayed behind glass windows as you enter the pub. Nice wooden bar and tiered dinning room with lots of hard wood giving a relaxed feeling to the establishment.   There was a good crowd at the bar and in the dinning areas with a board variety of guests. Bunch of dudes watching football at the bar and several families with kids in tow in the restaurant. Seating was ample and we were far enough from the youngest dinner, some of them needing a bit of \"juice\" to settle them down.  We were seated very quickly on the upper tier dinning area and our waitresses was over quickly to take our drink orders, wine from my better half (she is not a beer fan) and the Coopers Klosh for me. The menu is pretty large for a pub with lots of apps, salads, sandwiches, burgers and larger main dishes.  My wife went with the salmon while I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and the soup of the day, Italian weeding.   We had to laugh as I was enjoying the soup due to the music selection playing. I do love me some Jethro Tull, seen them many times in concert, but not feeling it when Cross Eyed Mary was playing overhead. Call me odd but a song about a child streetwalker is not my go to listening at lunchtime. The rest of the piped in music was all 60 &70's classic rock. The level was alright not overly load. I just  glad we were not subjected to more Christmas music!  My wrap was good with the chicken cooked through but not dried out. I would have preferred more heat but my tolerance for heat is pretty high on the scale. The portion size of the wrap was also very large. The fries were good considering they are beer battered, again a preference thing and you might like the battered fries. My wife's salmon was also cooked very well, done but not dried out. My wife was not crazy about the topping nor the balsamic glaze on the plate, stating that it was a bit more acid than needed for the salmon.  We visit the RRBC several times a year, usually for lunch. A very nice place for a good brew and food that is definitely better than the national family chains like Applebee's and Fridays."}
{"text":"They had call ahead seating, we only had to wait for less than 5 minutes. Service was efficient, and food was delicious. Lots of Vegan options, or ways to make dishes vegan with no problems! A new favorite!"}
{"text":"I had a burger on Tuesday, 3-21-17, at Ricky River Brewing.  Burgers w:fantastic fries, served w/cheese, lettuce, tomato on a pretzel bun are $6.50 on Tuesdays!  Omg, fantastic.  Very steaky-y tasting, juicy, flavorful meat.  Now this deal can't be beaten.  Fast service and excellent burger."}
{"text":"Service was great; Dan took excellent care of us. Hummus with olive tapanade was delicious, also enjoyed the sweet Thai calamari. Main courses enjoyed included portobello spinach salad with pickled onions, chicken tacos, raging bull burger, chicken wraps and grouper special. Dessert we also ate a cookie with ice cream that was fab and the fried ice cream. Everything was delicious and fresh.  No complaints at all. OH, yeah, the beer was great- recommend the watermelon wheat summer seasonal for the ladies who like a fruit beer. Also enjoyed the Oompa Loompa and the Christmas red ale. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"For the record, I hate \"Meh\". I would never, ever say \"Meh\". It makes me itchy.   Okay. Now that we've cleared that up....  I cannot give this place more than 2 stars because of the beer. I am a beer freak. I tried two different beers when I visited this place last December. They were both.... terrible. It takes A LOT for me to say a beer is bad. The Christmas Ale was so bad that it was rendered UNDRINKABLE by both my husband and myself.    That said, I have only visited RRBC once so I won't say that I will never go back and try another beer or five. Maybe it was a bad couple of batches? I dunno.  The service wasn't so hot either. We were there on a very snowy Thursday afternoon. There was virtually no one in there. The service should have been top notch as far as I'm concerned.   On the other hand... the food was pretty good. I had a burger and it was cooked to perfection. Nice and bloody - just the way I like 'em. I had the Buffalo chicken soup which was surprisingly decent. I enjoyed the french fries as well."}
{"text":"The last two times I have been there the service was awful, the appetizers were served still frozen and one person didn't get their meal till 30 minutes after the table had been served... Not worth it"}
{"text":"Once I went to RRBC with friends and then we moved the party to a nearby apartment only to go back to RRBC to ask them to open our wine bottles for us because the said apartment didn't have a wine bottle opener. Boys.    Annnyyywayyyy... on that occasion and all the other times I've been there, I've always had a great time. The servers/bartenders are friendly and the food is good. I especially recommend the asian nachos. And their back patio is awesome. Even when it's raining."}
{"text":"I have lived in Rocky River for almost two years now, and have been here even before I lived there and I have never been disappointed with the menu.  But, this last time I went was a few weeks ago on a Saturday afternoon for an Ohio State game and I just had the most delicious appetizer I had to start my review right now!   Just now when I went back to the menu to find the name of the appetizer to share with all of you, I CANNOT FIND IT! It was served with pita and was a mix of goat cheese, pesto, and a few other things and it literally was to die for.  I really hope this wasn't a seasonal app because it was so good.  So even though I cannot give you the exact name, check out the menu for it, it was a hot cheese dip that changed lives.  We were so full after we were done with it that we only each had like 2 bites of our meals, I promise it's that good!   In addition to this secret menu item the Asian nachos are on point! If you can't find the above I highly suggest these as a back up.  Also, if you like soft pretzels, they're pretty darn good!   As far as meals I am telling you I have never been disappointed, good pizzas, great salads, and love their wraps.  It's definitely not as greasy as the dive bar scene, but there are a lot of fried foods, but I consider most of the food fresh.    If you are going on a weekend, be prepared to wait. It get's really busy!  But if you are looking to go during the day or a weeknight as long as you aren't a big party you should be able to get seated right away."}
{"text":"As short as two years ago, RRBC was one of my favorite joints in the Cleveland area. Not a weekend went by that we considered eating there, and not a consideration went by before we decided that we'd go. Today, it barely enters our minds as a destination. Sometimes, when we drive by, I stare at it a little too long, wishing it was the RRBC of old, not the RRBC it's become.  While the beer recipes may be what have been brewed since I first dine there in 2004, it's just not the same. While the food is likely the same recipes, it's again not the same. Almost as if someone switched from hand pattied burgers to pre-packaged Sysco and figured it was good enough for them and the bottom line. And the atmosphere tries so hard to be Tremont or Ohio City with none of the charm.   There are a few bright spots, however; the french fries are still wonderful. The Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza is good, and the meatloaf dinner rivals any blue plate special out there in CLE+. The taco salad is filled with meat and more than enough for the money.   We don't go here much anymore, but, I think about it, and wish that it was how it was, instead of how it is."}
{"text":"Rocky River Brewing Company is the kind of place I like to find.  I had never heard of it before but I'm always looking to try new breweries and different beers.    My friend and I loved the place.  Cool bar inside with additional seating for dining as well as an outdoor patio.  Our bartender was friendly and helpful as we both went with the beer flight because we wanted to try everything.  The samples were very generous and the beers were very tasting.  We even made a few friends at the bar.    I'd recommend checking it out if you're into craft beers.  Not a bad place to spend a quiet afternoon."}
{"text":"So, I am pretty particular about my beer and my dressed up pub fare. I have had lots of both from fantastic to just bad.  Good news, this wasn't bad. Bad news, it was shakily mediocre.  Came here for dinner before going to the movies. It was very busy because of a charity event going on. We were seated by a door in the back that lead to the patio which normally wouldn't be a problem, but people from the event kept coming in and out and people smoking kept coming in and out and half the time they didn't even close the door. It was a little annoying and it didn't seem like the servers noticed or cared.   I got a burger and my date got the grouper. The burger was similar to the burgers at Winking Lizard, which isn't a bad thing, but since they describe themselves as a \"gastropub\" I expect something a little more elevated than that. The fries were also like frozen fries, so I wasn't thrilled about that. Also, they had ketchup in a glass bottle which is one of my biggest pet peeves. I'm paying to eat here, why do I have to work for my condiments?! My date enjoyed the grouper, although it looked a little like a meal they might serve at a retirement home.   The drinks were a whole other story, I got the Rogue Red Wave which I recall was an Irish Red Ale. Aside from the name being atrocious and bringing to mind things that I don't want to think about while eating or drinking, it was a pretty mediocre beer. Nothing better than something I could get for $7 a 6-pack. The flavor wasn't very developed and it had a bit of an aftertaste that was slightly unpleasant. But it was drinkable.  My date got their dark and stormy, when it arrived copper cup and all he had high hopes. He took a sip and I instantly knew something was wrong. When I tasted it, I wasn't entire sure what they had put in the drink. Whether it was the ginger beer, a dirty cup, or a case of switched ingredients the drink tasted horrible and there was something salty tasting about it. It was terrible.   Overall it wasn't a great experience and I doubt I'll be back since I'm from the eastside and would have to pass a lot of brewpubs that are far better to get to it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least 20 times since moving to the area. I frequently get the Greek pizza, which is addicting. They do not skimp on the feta and kalamata olives- yum! That being said, I've also enjoyed everything else I've tried, including pasta dishes, salads, tacos, veggie burger, fried ice cream, and several appetizers. Their menu accommodates a wide variety of palates and diets; many items have gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan options. I'd recommend the crispy tempura avocado tacos for vegans! Their prices are reasonable for the area, food quality, and portions. Their daily specials are fantastic deals (the personal pizzas are only $5 on Sundays)!   My fiance and I haven't tried a beer we didn't enjoy. I always bring my growler along to bring some home. The growler fills are NOT cheap, but are comparable to other local breweries, restaurants, and grocery stores in the area. The margaritas aren't anything to write home about, but house margaritas are only $3 on Wednesdays, so I still get them periodically.   They don't take reservations, so I'd avoid prime times on weekends if you don't want to wait at least 20 minutes for a table. It can get pretty noisy during game nights. My fiance and I tend to go later in the evening as we're night owls, and the kitchen is open until at least 10 PM (I think 11 PM?) Service at the bar or table has never been an issue! I'm looking forward to sitting outside on the patio when that opens up this spring.  My only complaint is that I recently discovered that they do not recycle. They could opt for more sustainable products in several areas. For example, they use Styrofoam clam-shells for leftovers, small plastic cups for dressings/dips, and stick straws in most drinks without asking the customers' preference. I do recognize that often the more environmentally friendly route is sometimes more expensive for the business. I will say that the staff have been pleasant and supportive when I bring my own cloth napkins and food containers for leftovers, so please consider doing this! However, the fact that they do not recycle certainly makes me think twice before indulging in RRBC now :("}
{"text":"Don't you dare try to sit at a table and not order food (at least before 10). Doesn't matter if it's 930 pm, there are open tables and you just ordered a $17 round of drinks (and plan on ordering more.) They will make you give up your seat. Service is always hit or miss. Only reason to go here are the Asian nachos and the deep dish chocolate cookie desert. Both are fantastic, but you have to deal with their crap to enjoy them."}
{"text":"I'm always generous with my stars so I guess I'll give this place 5 stars, never had any bad experiences here. I always drink the blueberry ale but I tried the \"punch in the nuts\" beer and it's easily my new favorite. Taste just like peanut butter, I love it. The food is always decent, I feel like ppl are so quick to give bad reviews off silly experiences, yes kitchens do make mistakes such is life."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland last weekend visiting some friends from college, and we ventured here for lunch on Saturday afternoon. I always love to try new places when I'm out of town and stay off of the 'chain' route, and this was a perfect choice!   It was pretty crowded for a lunch crowd, and I'm sure having March Madness on every TV helped as well. Since I was on 'vacation', I ordered a Pirate Lite, and it was a perfect lunch beer. Not too heavy, and it went awesome with my spinach and portabello salad. Having a ton of food options is always important to me since I follow a plant based diet, and this salad exceeded all of my expectations. It was a bigger portion, completely fresh, and very healthy with the vinaigrette dressing. Everyone loved their food (my friends got wraps, and sandwiches), and I would definitely check this place out again when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"I used to come here often, but recent service has made me stop.  I hope they can address it.    The food is and was, always excellent.  As are the beers and cocktails.  Love the beer battered fries, the Johnny mac 'n three cheese, the coopers ribs, the burgers, the sandwiches, and the pizza.    The service, however, needs work.  Not that everyone isn't cheerful.  Not that the waitstaff isn't working hard.  They just seem to have too much work, as as such, individual tables don't get much attention.    The last few times have been very similar.  After a 20 minute wait (which would be reasonable, accept the tables we were seated at were cleared and empty when we arrived; and no one got up in that section to make me think it was a staffing issue), we get to our table.  We order drinks, which take longer than you would think, but again not bad.  We put in our order when the drinks come.    Here is the issue.  We sit there for over an hour waiting for our meals.  My wife orders, depending on the day, a burger or a hot sandwich, I order ribs usually.  The burger or sandwich should be rather quick, and those ribs must be pre-cooked and just need some finishing.  Yet it takes over an hour.  When our food does come out, it's apparent it has been sitting under a heat lamp for some time.  The top of my otherwise juicy ribs are dry, and the bun of my wife's burger is also dried out.  Our food is almost never bought by our server, but by an expediter, who perhaps has gotten tired of seeing our food sit under a heat lamp.  It used to come out in half the time or less when we first started going.    Again, the waiters are not just standing around, they are constantly busy fetching drinks and taking orders and what not.  It just seems there sections are too large and they get behind, and too often it has been our food that draws the short straw.    If you are not in a hurry, I recommend the place.  But we go in hungry and are tired of being hangry by the time we do get our food.    It would be a 3 star review, but there are a few other things.  The place is loud.  It makes conversation during our long wait a challenge.  And the clientele.  As others have said, some are stuck up and entitled.  The biggest thing to me is they often bring young children that are left to their own devices to run all around the restaurant and make noise.  The kids will even chase each other around with balls they won at the claw machine.  No discipline.  They just sit there and let their kids ruin everyone else's meal.    Oh, and one more thing.  It would be helpful if we could call ahead and avoid the initial wait for a table.  But the hostesses said they do not offer call ahead seating.  But the seem to offer selective reservations, as we have seen people call and get their name in.  It would be nice if we could get the same.  No matter, we will be avoiding unless we have time to kill."}
{"text":"RUDE HOSTES! I love RRBC and greatly enjoy their food and the wait staff. However, The hostesses are some of the most rude and off putting that I have come into contact with. You enter the restaurant and they don't greet you you come up to them to give them your phone number and they act like they Act like you are interrupting them.I had an experience where I showed the hostess the text I received stating that my table is ready and she couldn't even bother to look up at me and proceeded to wave me off to the person next to her. They act like they don't want people to come and eat here."}
{"text":"Our latest experience at the RRBC was not the greatest. The service was pretty good and the atmosphere was hoppin' for an early Saturday evening. Where it went downhill was the food. I'll hit the good news first.  The Santa's Little Helper Christmas ale was a respectable offering. An amber-colored beer with a short-lived head spiced with the usual suspects (cinnamon, nutmeg) with a hint of coriander and bitter orange peel. Easy drinking and seasonal.  The beer cheese soup was stellar. It's probably one of the best dishes on the menu. My wife ordered the chargrilled salmon burger. It came with the beer battered fries and was pretty tasty. It definitely didn't look or taste like someone had made it fresh as it had the appearance and consistency of something pre-formed and frozen. The highlight was probably the tomato focaccia bun. Now for the bad.  I rarely order steak outside of an actual steakhouse and I thought I'd learned my lesson. Unfortunately, I hadn't had a nice piece of meat in awhile and I threw caution to the wind. I ordered the sirloin special - a roughly 10oz steak dressed with balsamic mushrooms and served with horseradish mashed potatoes and broccoli. I knew this was not going to go well as soon as my knife hit the meat.  This had to be one of the single worst steaks I've ever had in my life. First off I ordered it medium and it arrived just this side of mid-rare. Second, it was tough. I started in for my first bite and cut, and cut, and cut and...well, you get the picture. What meat was there was outweighed by completely inedible gristle and rubbery fat. I won't go on for fear of making you sick, suffice it to say that I barely made it through half of the steak before deciding I'd take the rest home for my dogs. And why bother with the broccoli? What arrived on my plate should have been served on a platter next to some baby carrots and cauliflower and a side of ranch dressing. It was lukewarm and raw. The highlight of this $20 entree was the horseradish mash.  You'd think I'd have learned my lesson but clearly I hadn't. I should have gone with the burger but I went in with two strikes - a steak at a brewpub and it was the special. I don't think I'll make that mistake again...hopefully."}
{"text":"I feel bad for the people who work here because the lights flicker creepily every few minutes...spaced out just long enough to forget.  It really gives this place a haunted mansion vibe and think I would probably go insane if I had to spend more than 2 hours here. I am genuinely confused by the 1 foot tall shelf/floor space used to store vinegar, sriracha, and other sauces -seems kind of gross but maybe I'm just too picky??? The best part about this place was our waiter.  Imagine if Stinky from Hey Arnold grew up as a real human being and has the deepest voice ever. I'm talking about like whatever the opposite of a dog whistle is deep- the kind of low pitched sound that will make you crap your pants if you aren't careful.  Great service is the only reason this isn't a 1 star review. He was polite, attentive, and helped explain the difference between the \"holiday mule\" and \"apple pie mule\" (the holiday mule has a sugar rim).  I had an IPA that was pretty good."}
{"text":"Ate here Sunday with friends and family good atmosphere drinks were good ordered a Pizza which $5 on Sunday's and it was delicious will come back on Sunday's more often"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was just ok. Beer was disappointing, tasted like rusty water. Does not seem to get any better over time."}
{"text":"It may be a brewery restaurant but the food is the main attraction for me. The Thai chicken, and Santa Fe salads are awesome. I tried the coconut curry bowl today and was impressed. Great flavor. The burgers are also great. The best thing though, is their fries. My whole family agrees that rrbc has the best fries around. They're big and potato-y but well breaded and slightly crunchy. I'm not doing them justice. I'll stop. The fries are awesome. Take my word for it. I don't mean to take away from the entrees but I always ensure that someone in my family orders something with fries so that I may graze on them if I don't get them myself.   If you're hungry, you can't choose poorly at Rocky River Brewing company. Their beer is pretty good."}
{"text":"The best thing about Rocky River Brewing Company is their awesome huge patio!! One of the best places to hang out for a couple drinks in town.  They have several kinds of their own beer, interesting flavors and all. I have eaten here twice and never was impressed with the food, but it was average.  The location is great if you're near Westgate, and parking is plentiful in the lot behind."}
{"text":"The service was pretty much spot, she had to put up with a sarcastic table. We are just very a smart Alec attitudes. Very good food but your tater tot balls need more of the actual ingredients that are suppose to be in them."}
{"text":"Great food and ok beer selection, but unfortunately it stops there. Take my advice and avoid this place like the plague on Friday and Saturday nights. The teenage wait staff and hostesses couldn't be any more clueless. Couple that with an overwhelming crowd and you've got yourself nothing short of a disaster. Oh, and don't bother calling ahead for immediate seating. I did just that and still found myself and family standing around the bar like a chump, waiting 60 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"There are several reasons to love RRBC and a few are these: having been only one other time, I walked in for the return visit and was immediately remembered by the bartender (who then personalized my bar tab with \"Chi-Town\"). Unbeknownst to me, Sunday evenings are Super Cheap Night so all the house pints were $2.50 and my one-person pizza was only $5. I also managed to leave with a bomber of beer as a gift from said bartender. Seriously? What else is there to say? Oh, the food? Ok.  The fried pickles, I'm becoming a connoisseur, are the best of the four I've had in town thus far. The beer selection rotates enough that it keeps things interesting (the blueberry was surprisingly good) and my garlic/spinach/tomato pizza was deeee-lightful. My companion's chicken quesadilla was met with a shrug, however  Either way, it's a great spot to hang out especially on a mellow Sunday evening and has jumped to position two of my three-brewery investigation list."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for so long that I just assumed I had already reviewed this gem.   Maybe it's because of how many times I've been here, but I've never had anything less than stellar service.  The bartenders actually get to know you and everything about you and vice versa.    Outside of some great beers brewed on site, the food is really so much more than you'd expect from this kind of establishment.  They run some amazing specials from day to day.  Skillet cookie is a must to end any night."}
{"text":"Wings were fine. Burger was great. Excellent service. Their beers are really good, nothing fancy but solid quality"}
{"text":"As a vegan I love having food options!! My spouse isn't a vegan and got the strip steak and said it was really fatty and lots of grit.  My planet power tacos where great except the corn tortillas.  The tortillas fell apart so I ate them with a fork.  Beers were good we sat outside because inside had a wait.  Sat next to heated which was nice.  The waitress put the Clemson game on the tv (until the Ohio state game came on honestly no complaint there; I get we live in Ohio).  We will be back"}
{"text":"Met here with some work colleagues and fellow Yelpers last night. We all had a few microbrews and we each ordered an appetizer (or two) to share. The beer was good and the food was of good quality. I thought the wings, the chicken queso dip, and the stuffed pretzels were all exceptionally good. Although it was a good, solid experience, I was disappointed that we couldn't sit outside on the patio (how hard would it have been to open up the patio; the tables and chairs were already out there?). Also, after we received our food and our first couple rounds of beer, our waitress was much more difficult to find when we needed her. However, overall, I had an A-OK time and would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The bar/patio outside is great for sunny summer days/warm summer nights and the beer sampler is a great way to try their brews as long as you have someone to share them with as it's a lot to drink! I tried the beer cheese soup and was not impressed, I would not recommend ordering this, but I would highly recommend the Asian Nachos. Once again I will have to say that the burgers are delicious and definitely something everyone should try!"}
{"text":"I came here with my gf and I am new to the area so we go to places to try things out that I have not had a chance to. RRBC is not somewhere I would recommend for new residents of RR. The bartender was an older gentleman who when we sat down at the bar was on his cell phone and seemed to be bothered that we interrupted his busy text. He never once said \"Welcome to RRBC\" my name is .... Basically used the approach of what do you want and why are you bothering me. No social skills at all and never once recommended any specials or even if they had any specials. The only reason I am giving this place a star is because it was very clean and the food was very good, just too bad the service sucked and actually ruined my high expectations of an Ohio Brewing Company."}
{"text":"I went with my brother and cousin and got chorizo eminadas and sweet tai calamari for appetizers. The empinadas weren't great, but the calamari was incredible.   For my entre I got the Chorizo Burger. The bun was good, but a little harder than most and the burger had a good spiciness too it. If you don't mind a little bit messy, it's a really good burger.   For my beer, I tried the Monster Mash (which may be seasonal) and it was really good. said it had a lot of flavors in it, but it was blended well and not over powering. I'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Seems to be mainly frozen foods, not homemade or very fresh. Skillet cookie is the bomb though!"}
{"text":"I have been to Rocky River Brewing Company a few times now and think they have one of the biggest and best menus around. So many appetizer, salad, sandwich and burger options to choose from. I ended up ordering the Thai Chicken Salad which was a good order. Everything on the menu sounded good so it was hard to choose. Their beer menu is also really good! It's a large restaurant with a good size patio. It was a nice day when we went so I wish I would've realized they had tvs outside (we wanted to watch some football games) so we could've sat there. However, I have to complain about how slow the service was. It took over 10 minutes for a waitress to come to our table and then it took over a half hour to get our food. It was during the day and not very crowded so I couldn't believe how slow this was. I want to go back and visit again and give it another shot, but it was unfortunate to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Danny would say this place \"has more charm then what it appears\". Service was friendly but slow. Beer selection: top notch. food: applebees. I'd appreciate it a bit more if the servers could describe their house brews a little better. I'd go back and sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I expect good beer at a brewing company and they pass the test here.   While not great (it's no Great Lakes Brewery) they have very good beer here, including a (sigh) porter.   The surprise is how good the food is.  Terrific pretzel chicken.  French fries are crispy and delicious.   Not crazy about their fish, but burgers, appetizers etc are great.  The bartender was really friendly and attentive even though they were busy.    My only complaint is that a couple times that we were there, they wouldn't let us sit at the high tables in the bar.  They were reserved for some reason.   But the rest of the experience was great - a trifecta of beer, food and atmosphere.   Oh and in good weather, try outside  - they have a great outside seating area with its own bar."}
{"text":"This place was hopping! Lots of exciting vibe! Menu could have been better but the beers were very delicious! Lots of room to hang out and watch the game! Beautiful inside!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! We started off with a Flight of their Beers ($10 btw for 7 4oz-AWESOME deal) and sampled the top 3 dishes on the menue: Ribs, Thai One, and Johnny's Mac-and Cheese. All three dishes were terrific! I personaly ordered the Thai One and boy, was it delicious. It's an americanized version of Pad Thai with the perfect amount of spice and chicken. (This dish is def spicy). The ribs were good as they fell off the bone- i do recommend ordering a side order of sauce though. Lastly, the mac and cheese was just ok. It almost had a mexican flare to it with the tomato, scallions, and sausge in it.  Def can't wait to come back and try more goodies on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood go-to place for a pleasant meal and drinks. The food is a definitely a step up from your standard bar food, even though the atmosphere has a bit of sports bar to it, the noise level isn't overwhelming. In the summer, they have a really great patio.  Our favorite menu item is the Asian nachos: fried wontons with chicken, wasabi mayonnaise, and a sweet Thai sauce.  The salads are good and fresh, the burgers are tasty, and the fries are yummy. I don't drink beer, so I have no opinion on it, but despite not liking beer, I really like this place."}
{"text":"Talk about a great beer list! This place has awesome beer selections, my favorite being the Coopers Gold Ale and the Blueberry Ale. The buckets of mini burgers are awesome, the pretzel buns are delicious and the California Chicken Sandwich is my favorite on the menu.   The patio is my favorite in the summer time with the outdoor bar! The staff is very friendly and accommodating.   However, my husband has a family member with a wheel chair and there is only one section of 3-4 tables that can accommodate her. Most of the seating areas inside have stairs leading to them or most of the tables are high-tops on the one seating area that can accommodate her. That can be a huge inconvenience on a Friday or Saturday night, as they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good! There's a nice variety of options for all your cravings. They have best beer battered fries and the homemade tater tot appetizer are a real treat!  The only downside is the service here is typically slow and not very attentive no matter where you sit; bar, table or the patio . The food makes up up for though."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to RRBC. I was satisfied with my meal, but I won't be hurrying back.   Wednesday is 3$ margaritas and 3$ chips and salsa. The only margarita that's 3$ is the original house margarita. We tried the pineapple jalapeño, my absolute favorite. Most places provide no spice at all. The pineapple margarita was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. If I were to go back, it would be for the pineapple margarita, too bad they don't serve by the pitcher...   Onto the food. The salsa is slightly sweet and very tasty. I had a BBQ bacon burger. The bacon was crispy, I love it like that. The burger was cooked perfectly, but it could have used a bit more BBQ sauce. The fries are beer battered, but nothing to rave about.   The bestie ordered the Santa Fe salad with avocado ranch dressing. The dressing was delicious, but the salad was disappointing. The toppings were skimpy, mostly lettuce in a bowl.   The service was good, also nothing to rave about. Our chips and salsa were delayed and she seemed slightly overworked.   Overall, the patio and the pineapple margarita are the only reasons I'd go back."}
{"text":"Came with my girlfriend because I heard that the head chef is vegan, and we both are. When we first walked in, we stood for about 5 minutes waiting to be seating, not knowing that we were in the wrong spot. Multiple employees walked past us, and not one asked how we were or if we needed any help. Mind you, it was not busy at all for a Saturday night. We walked around for a bit and finally found where we needed to be, and the hostesses again looked at us without asking how we were. We got an attitude-laced \"just 2?\" And after we gave our name, we were ignored again. The bar was fine, a nice older man took my drink orders and gave them to me promptly. The waitress was great and we got our food and drinks quickly. The food was not amazing, but not awful. Don't think we will be coming back again."}
{"text":"fun place. family oriented. great place for a date or to meet up with friends.  they used to have an awesome monday night special, not sure if they still do that, but you got a steak, potato, veggie and a beer for 12 bones. um, yes please.  love the variety of beer on tap. like fatheads they had a blueberry that i really loved.  love the atmosphere. fun place to watch a game.  asian nachos. yes. please. super delish. looking for somewhere casual to eat, drink and hangout, choose RRBC. close to home and fun!"}
{"text":"Good pub food and good beer. Nothing fantastic, but it is a staple in our family because pretty much everything is consistently good."}
{"text":"We've been going to RRBC and I'm disappointed to see it's been going downhill the last few years in regards to service. The food and beer are great but the last few times the service was so bad I'm not really interested in going back. They screwed up our orders so badly and it took so long to get the food it's just not worth it...something like we ordered a burger and they brought a reuben...stuff like that. A one time occurence I'd let it go but it seems to keep happening. The management needs to address it.  Asian nachos and fish tacos are AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Our very favorite restaurant in the Lakewood rocky river area.. the jalapeño stuffed pretzals dipped in the beer cheese soup is awesome and so is the johnny mac and cheese!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Good service but when I ordered the parmesan chicken the last thing I expected was onions. What fucking moron puts green onions on Parmesan chicken! This the last time I come here!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Great patio.  Staff is very good too. This place is very popular so it's busy, loud and crowded.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Parking is very plentiful especially in the empty lot next door.  Prices are reasonable too.  I little bit too loud on busy nights but that's not their fault because it's just a busy place."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure eating here. I always get your veggie burger because it's the best around. The mango salsa on top with fresh sprouts are the perfect combo. Beer battered fries are a dying breed so I'm excited I've found somewhere that makes them not too fried, not too soggy. My partner enjoys your bacon burger with ranch all over it. Super tasty. Great for pick up or dine in!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times. The food is pretty good (a fan of the beer battered french fries and the selection of burgers), but I've always enjoyed bar food.  There are a variety of deals throughout the week including my favorite: $5 dollar \"Big ass beers\" (23 oz. beers) and $5 wing buckets on Thursdays. They also have very good grouper sandwiches.The brewery changes their beer selection throughout the year for the season changes and to keep variety in the menu. Their christmas ale is very good, along with their blueberry beer and their \"Punchin' the nuts\" beer. In the summer, the patio is in a very nice location with televisions and an outdoor bar. The inside is a little cramped around the bar area and can get pretty loud at night, but I've always enjoyed the place. I usually take people from out of town to the restaurant for a nice casual setting and they typically enjoy it as well. I would recommend the place to anyone living nearby."}
{"text":"Wonderful time here. Food was excellent (try the mash potatoes as a side). Service was friendly and correct.  Beer was good, but not the best part, there were some off flavors and such, but also equally as many standouts. Try the blueberry and the blond, but shy away from the strong ale.  I had the california chicken sandwich and tried a bit of the reuben, it was inventive and a fresh change from what you normally find at bars and brewpubs."}
{"text":"Warm and laid back.  Love the meatloaf and the $12.50 steak and pint deal on Monday is superb!  Beers are solid and the Christmas selections were the best I've had there.  Patio is full of regulars, which says something about the place,  Family and date friendly, check it out.  Price point is fair."}
{"text":"The food is always good here and there are often changes on the menu that are fun.  The buckets of mini chicken sliders, wings or hamburger sliders are served with fries and tasty.  The beer is very good.  We have dined here many times and keep going back, I like the chicken sandwiches, salmon, and pasta."}
{"text":"I love the food and the atmosphere here. The servers are great but the hostess's are probably some of the rudest girls I've ever encountered at a restaurant. They don't smile, they don't speak, and they don't even seem to know they're working because they're too busy gossiping with each other. Everything would be great if they were fired."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot and would like to go back but since I live nowhere near here,  doubtful I will ever make it. They had maybe 6-7 beers on tap. I had a stout, IPA and a simple lager infused with a blueberry concentrate that were all very smooth and drinkable. The food was very good also. Loved the beer cheese soup and the macaroni with cheese, andouille sausage and tomatoes was very good. There lots of brew houses here and there and some are good, some not. This is one of the good ones."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC place to come. The wait is sometimes a little long, but that's to be expected. Awesome variety of beers and they carry GLBC on tap, so I can't complain at all."}
{"text":"This review is for the craft beers I experienced at Rocky River Brewing Company...  Stopped in one evening to try out a tasting flight of their craft brews. They default sampler is 8 beers - so I tried them all:  Rocky River Pirate Light (4.0% ABV) Blueberry Ale (4.7% ABV) Cooper's Gold Kolsch (4.7% ABV) Firelands Pale Ale (6.2% ABV) Blarney Rubble Irish Red (5.4% ABV) Hop Goblin IPA (7.6% ABV) Titan Triple Belgium Strong Ale (8.6% ABV) Tullymore Forest Irish Stout (5.7% ABV)  The only brew I enjoyed and would consider ordering a pint of - was the \"Tullymore Forest Irish Stout.\" It had a nice richness and flavor to it. Overall, I was disappointed in most of the craft beers.  There were a lot of folks in the bar area the night I visited. I will have to come back and try the food some time. Service was friendly and good.  #RockyRiverBrewingCo"}
{"text":"What happened to this place?!  Beer has not been good for a few years and food is still hit or miss.   The service is horribly slow.  There are a lot better breweries in close proximity.  The clientele of RRBC has changed muched either, still typical, uppity Rock River yuppies.."}
{"text":"I had heard about their Asian nachos via social media, so we thought we'd try it out before seeing a movie at the AMC across the street.   We had the option to go inside or outside, and it being a beautiful evening,we decided on the patio out back. It's such a cool patio, with a full bar and tons of sitting space. I ordered a sangria and my boyfriend ordered one of their beers. I then ordered the Asian nachos (a favorite via everyone on the internet) and a chicken/mango quesadilla. Both of these options are on the appetizer menu.   The sangria was good, and my boyfriend claimed the beer he ordered (I'm not sure of which one) was one of the best beers he had ever had. That's saying something, as he is a beer snob some (or just I) might say.  Food:  The Asian nachos were legit. So crispy, had a nice wasabi bite to it. The chicken was shredded, the cheese was melted to perfection, and the sauce they put on it is superb. Great and light.  The quesadilla was just alright. It wasn't anything to rave about, but it just lacked a bit of flavor I was expecting.  I'll be coming back specifically to try other things on the menu alongside the Asian nachos. Literally, after the movie I wanted to go back and get more."}
{"text":"I have to say, my food here was great. I ordered the sandwich that our waitress told us was the most popular one on the menu, the California Chicken, so I'm glad it lived up to my expectations. Adding bacon (if you follow my reviews I think you'll notice a trend here) cost me and extra $1.50, which I'd say is pretty standard.   We came on a Wednesday which is also $3 margarita and $3 chips and salsa day. We thought that the margarita sampler sounded fun because we were too indecisive to pick out one drink, so why not get three? Well, the sizes of these samples were comical, especially when you took the amount of ice into the equation. The blood orange tasted like tang, the watermelon jalapeno was decent, and the raspberry grapefruit was the best in my opinion, but it was quite sweet and they all were pretty watered down. When we got our bill I realized that the sampler was $9 (wasn't listed on the menu) - so the exact same price it would have cost us to get three full sized margs- I feel like as a server I would have mentioned that to my table, but nope, not here.  Okay, Okay. That's what you get for ordering margaritas at a microbrewery I know, I know. So from there we switched to beer. I ordered their Christmas Ale, which unlike the other infamous Cleveland Christmas Ale that takes offense to this, they as if you'd like a cinnamon sugar rim. All and all I thought it was a solid choice.  At this point we're done eating and ask for boxes. The waitress returns with them and asks if we wanted more drinks, to which we said no. I thought boxes + no more drinks usually = check, but nope. Not here. She left and disappeared for Forty. Five. Minutes. After almost an hour with our food boxed and drinks finished she came back and asked if we needed anything to which I chimed in \"Checks!\" and she acted totally surprised and went to get them. What?  Food and beer - tasty. Margs and service - sketchy."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pacific Beach tacos with blackened cod. The fish was delicious , the filling was good too, but the cold, broken corn tortillas really was disappointing. Everything fell out of the shell as I picked up the first bite because it didn't seem to be heated in the slightest. So I used my fork and ate it like a salad If the tortillas were actually cooked and somewhat crisp, it would have made a big difference.  I would try once more, maybe it was a fluke. The green rice was tried twice but was cold as well and not flavorful.  Maybe next time I'll order the blackened cod and fillings separately. That was really delicious"}
{"text":"Very nice establishment, with quality food and beverages. Rarely do you ever hear both sides to a story, keep that in mind when you read some of the \"reviews\" posted by the filthy inbred degenerates on this site.   Fact: Service can become a bit shaky when the establishment fills up.   Tip: Put on your grown-up pants and be patient.   Edit: If you don't like what's on the TV, order takeout.   TL; DR Restaurant serves quality food and beverages."}
{"text":"We have had consistently great experiences here. The beer is tasty and so are the Moscow Mules! We like to try the new things on the menu (it is updated pretty regularly) but our favorites are the Asian Nachos, pretzel chicken and the macaroni and cheese. The mac and cheese is no ordinary kiddie mac-- it has andioulle sausage, peppers, four cheeses-- it is fabulous! The outside patio is perfect in the summer, and the staff has always been friendly and attentive. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Their Christmas Ale and Blueberry Beer are both GREAT!  Their french fries are great so order a bucket of them while you are there.    I had a bacon BBQ Burger and I had to say it was one of the best burgers I have ever had."}
{"text":"Ok, i ordered the bacon cheeseburger...when i think bacon cheeseburger i picture a juicy burger covered in melty cheese and crisp bacon, piled high with lettuce, tomato, onion and a buttered toasted bun...what i got was a sad not well seasoned patty on a dry bun with a tasteless slice of white american cheese and two lame pieces of bacon. No toppings and no condiments and no bacon cheeseburger sinful indulgence...so so disappointing. I would have been better off satisfying my burger craving at the Wendy's drive through right next store (seriously their new burgers are at the top of the fast food bar).  So what saves this place? Everyone else at my table said their food was of good bar food quality and the drinks variety was good. Also, this place knows their spuds. The fresh bucket of chips with french onion dip were so salty good and the beer battered fries with the (lame!) burger were perfect."}
{"text":"Wife and I came here for lunch, got lucky and got seated right away as there is usually a wait. the burgers are delicious and the service was solid. Nothing to complain about will be back in the future."}
{"text":"We live 45 minutes away but somehow have ended up here on 3 different occasions, and that's not such a bad thing!  We have always had really good luck with the food here. The first time my wife had the Potato Pancake Reuben she said it was the best thing she'd ever eaten, and still brings it up from time to time 3 years later. It's definitely not on the healthy side, but it's worth the calories. The pretzel crusted chicken has always been a favorite of mine. And we noticed other yelp reviews of the Asian nachos and tried them on our last visit, and we weren't disappointed.   The atmosphere is cool, I like the big metal beer barrel, it's very brewery-ish. It might be personal preference, but I've never been in love with their beers. I drink them, just not the reason we keep coming back."}
{"text":"Downgrading for not only lacking bicycle parking, but ignoring me when I pointed it out."}
{"text":"Good food but they gave me white rice though instead of fried rice. I had the beef and broccoli and it was a lot of food!"}
{"text":"There were four star highs and two star lows...hence the three star average.   Highs: Awesome, friendly, skilled bartender by the name of Rob. He went out of his way to create his very own, very good Bloody Mary when the waitress said they use a mix. Then he cared enough to come over to the table to check on how we liked them..and stayed to describe how he made them. Excellent bar service! Another high, according to the hubby, was the beer. He really liked Santa's Little Helper!   Cons: The waitress wasn't familiar with the menu, but was friendly and tried. The big negative was the Reich burger. Described as a burger on a brioche roll covered with hash brown potatoes and melted cheddar, it sounded really good. Not so much in actuality. The burger itself was a thin flavorless patty. Those hash brown potatoes? Nothing more than that crappy oval disk you get at McDonalds. Even the cheddar was flavorless. They COULD make this a stellar burger...good beef for starters. Try adding REAL hash browns...you know  with onion and peppers and seasoning! Then top it with a fried egg and maybe a little bacon or crispy pork belly...THEN you'd have something!  I'd go back and try something different...and definitely go back for anoth!er Bloody Mary! Worth another shot!"}
{"text":"If anyone knows one thing about how I pick restaurants, a good deal is usually a requirement. I chose this spot because they have a $6 burger meal deal on Tuesdays and I had never been here before. The fact that they serve delicious beers may have played into it as well. ;)  Lately I've been on a chorizo kick and saw they had a chorizo burger on a pretzel bun. Win. It was a toss up though when I came across a turkey burger on a tomato foccacia roll. I'm a sucker for good breads and sometimes that can sway my decision. I stuck with the chorizo and my date had the turkey burger, so it worked out that I got to try both.   Overall I was pretty underwhelmed by the food. The intrigue was there but they were both missing something to give them a great flavor. It seemed to me that the chorizo burger had too much ground meat mixed in that it distracted from the spice of the chorizo. Both of the buns were delicious though.   Had a beer with dinner that was my favorite part of the meal. They've got a great selection of brews on tap. Being that it was their own beers brewed in-house, I expected a cheaper price but each beer still cost about 5 or 6 dollars. Paired with the cheap burger night, the tab was still reasonable overall."}
{"text":"Tasty beers and food. The French fries are a beer battered fried to perfection treat. The wings came out well done just the way we ordered them and were tasty. We had the Christmas Ale and Blueberry beer both stood on their own two feet. The ale was a nice malty beverage focused more on the seasons flavors and less on the hoppy bitterness like many other Christmas ales. The blueberry reminded me of Fatheads minus the live blueberrys dancing in the cup.   We had the bucket of chicken sandwiches for dinner.  It was a safe and conservative dish. Not much danger in pairing cheddar cheese with chicken and barbecue sauce. No complaints, it hit the spot."}
{"text":"WHY we liked this place so much remains a mystery...it doesn't really fit into our typical dining template with the noise, and the beer, and the noise. However, we loved our experience here.   I had pretzel-crusted chicken and boyfriend had the meatloaf, and we were very happy not only with the food, but with the **value**. That is, you get a lot of bang for your buck here. Lots of food, delicious mashed taters, and I received TWO tasty slabs o' chicken, such that I had to take one of the breasts home.   The atmosphere is actually really beautiful too; gleaming wood everywhere, a three-tiered dining area, lots of windows, a huge, old timey bar, and interior windows so you could see their little beer silo situation.   The only lackluster part of the experience were the lackluster teenagers manning the Host booth. They seemed very confused about life. It's also very loud in here but if you come early enough, people aren't quite drunk yet.  All said, we'll definitely be back either for dine-in or take-out!"}
{"text":"Beers were good today.  If you like a nice barleywine, check it out while its in tap.    the food is pretty good, and the bartenders/servers are excellent.    No complaints, just good beer and a nice place to hang out."}
{"text":"Good beer good food long wait. Worth it? Yes but not a 5 star. The long wait was for the table and food. A little to pricie. Would I come back? Big may be"}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday cavs night! The place was crowded at 7pm but seating was still available for a party of 2. A bit loud, but hey the game was on and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves  Our server Renee was awesome! She was very patient as we took our time to decide, and was very attentive to our table.  We decided on shrimp and grits and fish and chips. Both were absolutely delicious. The shrimp and grits was just the right portion size.  The shrimp was just the right amount of spicy and the andouille sausage gave it a nice kick. Grits were creamy and well seasoned.  The Fish and Chips were served in a cute tin bucket which kept the heat in throughout the meal. The fish and chips are served with coleslaw and tartar sauce. The brownish color of the coleslaw admittedly is a little strange but i assume it was beer based to make it that color but the flavor was excellent.  For all of the St. Ignatius fans seeing the Reisch burger on the menu will put a smile on your face.  The only thing i was a little puzzled about was the entry. It is rare to see an entry with no option other than to climb a set of stairs, albeit only 3 to get into the restaurant Maybe i missed another entrance but if you have issues climbing stairs or have a family member that this will challenge call ahead for entry options. We enjoyed ourselves We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"It has been about 4 years since I checked this place out. Then I sat on the patio and enjoyed the atmosphere, don't think I ate at that time. So I wanted to give it another try. We arrived Saturday night about 8pm. The place was uncomfortably packed with an hour wait and 3 deep at the bar. As we contemplated staying, we were able to secure some spots at the bar after about 15 minutes. We decided to stay at the bar rather than getting a seat. The beers were just okay, nothing special or memorable. The food was not good. Very reminiscent to a brewery, which is why I tend to not eat at big breweries like this. I got a bucket of burgers, which were pretty dry, the fries were pretty delicious however. My girlfriend got a chicken salad sandwich which she said was good and her boyfriend got a pretzel crusted chicken with white cheddar mashed potatoes. His dish was tasty, despite the chicken having a very heavy mustard flavor, but absolutely not for the price of 16.50. I don't anticipate returning to this spot, except for possibly the patio and a drink if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people think bringing their kids to a BREW PUB is a good idea. But knock it the hell off! Rrbc would get a solid 4 stars from me if they would bother trying to keep families with children separate from the rest of us that give a crap about having a good time. As I write this I am surrounded by  no less than 5 children. Small children. And we were the first seated in this section so none of that \"ask for somewhere else\" be from you parents out there.   Places need to grow a pair when it cones to families with kids. I know they're trying to make a buck but seriously. Its like we can't go anywhere anymore.  The food and beer are very tasty, but the kids here keep me from being a regular."}
{"text":"Definitely a good place to take a group, food is a great value and service has been very prompt when I have been there. For sure it's a must try while in Rocky River. If you like American food and want a quieter than most atmosphere for watching a game you should go here over say a local bar. It is also very kid friendly and the fact that it's a brewing company doesn't mean you are obligated to get a beer, definitely a place for all ages."}
{"text":"Decent all around; good in some aspects. This place is always pretty crowded. Wait was supposed to be 45 minutes but it ended up being 10...don't know about that. Our server, Kelly, was very knowledgeable and friendly. The vegan options are there but they are a lot alike with the same ingredients and flavors. There are also many gluten free options. The decor is a little too old, especially with all of the wood paneling and older TV's with old programs such as a funny video clip being played. I just do not like such things on the TV's when I am out to eat. The bar is nice and large and has many TV's for when they have something good on. The brewing area takes up space so the restaurant is neither large or spacious. We would come back if the vegan menu was reshaped and outdoor seating was open. (Outdoor seating looked nice but was closed)"}
{"text":"I am only giving this place two stars because it was enjoyable with my family.  I do not see what is so special about this place other than the beer.  I came to the realization that it IS the beer which makes the food \"decent\".  I have been here twice due to family requests of meeting here.  They were both family gatherings in which we had a recession between funeral wakes since a funeral home is right across the street.  The FIRST time we came here, I ordered a burger.  I know they are trying to be healthy but the meat tasted like grass to me.  After half a burger I guess the only thing to wash away that taste is some of their beer.  The SECOND time a few months later we ate here again and I felt they deserved a second chance.  I ordered the pizza.  The spinach and cheese pizza.  I distinctly remember saying \"Light spinach\".  Light spinach however meant; Spinach topped with spinach and a side of spinach coupled with spinach!  I'm not Popeye the Sailor man so I do NOT wish to eat THAT much spinach!  EVERY bite of pizza had a big leaf of spinach.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING both times around.  Next time, I'll choose to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I went to Rocky River Brewing Company during lunch on a Tuesday with some co-workers. We were seated right away. I was very excited to see three veggie options on the menu that looked delicious: house-made veggie burger, caprese sandwich and portabella sandwich. Decisions decisions decisions. The veggie burger won and it was DELICIOUS!! Fries came with it. I also had two blueberry ales. Very fine lunch!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy my time at the Rocky River brewing co. Delicious food, craft beers-brewed in house, decent wine selection, and mixed drink selection. The menu caters to vegans, vegetarians, and meat lovers. Monday night is an awesome special: Sirloin Steak, cheddar mashed potatoes, broccoli, and a craft beer... all for a whopping $12.50. Highly recommend for a date night or a low key night."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for a while and decided to stop by today as I was in the Rocky River area for a change. Had a river burger cooked medium on a pretzel bun served with a side of beer battered fries. The food was fantastic! Also sampled the Viking Pillager double IPA and the Hop Goblin IPA, which is a West Coast style IPA. Viking Pillager was simply ok, and the Hop Goblin was a notch or two better. Wouldn't drive out here just for the beers, but they were decent. The decor in here screams \"brewery!\" with an Irish pub style bar made of dark wood and plenty of views of the fermentation tanks make this a very pleasant place to fill your belly with great food and decent beer. Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Service; pretty fair. I could tell the waitress had a long day but she still put on a smile when she came to our table.  Food: good quality, the price is extremely fair and I had no complaints about the way the food was prepared.  Beer: definitely worth trying their in-house brews. I was there with my brother and girlfriend who ordered mixed drinks and those also seemed to be of good quality.  I definitely plan on going here again, be sure to check out their nightly specials."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've been here. The last time I was here a woman called the cops on me because I took the parking spot she was waiting for (I honestly did not realize this when took it. Yes, dick move on my part, but something to call the cops over? Uh...no). When I suggested to the policeman that this must be a joke, he threatened to arrest me for disorderly conduct (for a story some soccer mom told him about me taking the spot). Needless to say, I wasn't in a hurry to go back.   Why am I including this story you ask? Well, because it explains the clientele of this place so very well. It is full of suburban folk with their nose in the air. No matter how much I enjoy the beer, no matter how much I love the patio (especially the tiki bar), or how happy I am that they have vegan options (the only reason I went back tonight by the way), I just don't enjoy the atmosphere. I went tonight simply as a compromise with a family of picky eaters (I'm vegan, and my mom and sister are \"boring\" lol). The vegan tacos weren't bad at all. I had the plant powered ones, and my only complaint is that I could tell the tofu wasn't marinated. It really needed to sit in the sauce longer in order to pick up more flavor. As is, some bites tasted like plain tofu. The flavors otherwise melded well. I really enjoyed the black beans and green rice that came as sides.   Would I go back again? Maybe, as a compromise. Would I ever go here on my own accord? No. The food is average, the drinks are a bit overpriced, and the clientele is not for me. The service was on point, and I was thankful for that!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and even better brews. I could eat there every night for weeks, if possible. Their turkey burger is so good, especially compared to most dry, unseasoned versions. I highly recommend it. This is one of those places you have to try at least once in your life, especially if you love a good beer."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. I am always get a good meal here.  I especially like the fact that they come up with very creative offerings that turn out deliciously perfect and keep me coming back for more.  Lately, I have been addicted to their fish tacos, yum. They do a great job and the mango salsa is perfect.  You need to understand something here, I have spent years in California where the food is the best in the nation.....no debate. And Rubio's fish tacos set the standard AND the bar so high that noone can make a fish taco as GREAT as Rubios!  Although, these fish tacos in no way resemble the fish tacos of Rubios (they are truly one of a kind and cannot be outdone), they have found a way to offer fish tacos that are very enjoyable, tender and tasty with a great accompanyment. And of course, the suds are always a treat, especially on these 90 plus degree days that aren't going away anytime soon.  So, stop in and order something new that you havent' tried or perhaps even considered before, they will definitely add a new treat to your (hopefully) every expanding palate of discoveries."}
{"text":"Love this place- got a few different types of beers (pumpkin smash, Christmas ale) and both were great. Also ordered a few of the tater tots which were killer! Service was great too."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. Second stop of a west side adventure with two friends.  Off we went after our West End Tavern to explore one of the great microbreweries surrounding Cleveland. I love how there's such unique microbreweries around the city of Cleveland...and there's so many.   Kind of in the middle of a suburbian plaza, RRBC stands out. We walked in, seated immediately in a rather large restaurant. It's cool too-along the walls it shows all their awards, what they've been given by the Brewer's association, and what not.  We were pretty full from lunch, so we just got some appetizers. I got this coffee flavored beer (forgot) the name, which was DELICIOUS. Just ask for the coffee flavored one. For appetizers, we got some nachos, pretzels filled with cream cheese, and a bucket of voodoo sticks (hey, why not). The voodoo sticks were rather interesting with their meat filled centers...almost like a taquito. But overall, food was so-so, but as always, the drinks were good. I take that back- I did really enjoy the pretzels. Sinking your teeth into sweet cream cheese? Glorious.  Definitely would be a cool spot to stop in the summer. Stop by this landmark if you love microbreweries!"}
{"text":"I really liked the IPA I ordered. Service at the bar was excellent, but our server at our table was robotic and uninterested. I ordered a burger and although it was not very creative, it did the job. If you want a gourmet burger I'd still recommend B Spot or Beer Engine."}
{"text":"All around a decent place to eat, the food is good however the beer selection and the beer they brew here leaves something to be desired.   Even thought it's a brewing company you'll want to go here for the food not the beer"}
{"text":"The food & beer are always good, so I'd definitely check it out. Unfortunately, I have tried to go in a large group (6-8 people) four times in the past few months and every time they have lost our call ahead reservation. I contacted the restaurant several days ahead each time and asked what is the best way to bring a relatively large group at a busy time, and they recommended that I call ahead a couple hours prior to our arrival and they'd be able to accommodate us in a speedy manner. Each time I've done this trying to make things easier for everyone involved, they've \"lost\" our call ahead reservation.  I'm not sure if they are purposely doing it to discourage large groups or they're simply incompetent. Either way, it's not a pleasant experience. Again, I love this place and the food & beer is always consistently good. Just beware!!"}
{"text":"Went here a few months ago for the first time and was not disappointed. This place is awesome. Great food selection and craft beer. It was a Friday or Saturday evening when I was there with my wife and daughter and her husband. Was very busy but we got right in. Our server was good and stayed on top of everything. Always amazes me when they take our orders without writing anything down. It all came out correct.  We all enjoyed the outside patio and our meals were great. I will be back."}
{"text":"Nice casual place to grab some decent food and beers as well.  Visited for the first time in a long time last night and great deck / outdoor bar.  Very good service as well."}
{"text":"This seems like a solid pick in CLE for beer and pub grub. Went for lunch with a coworker. I wasnt overly impressed with the French Dip. It was pretty good but nothing exceptional. Even the fries - which they rave about were just OK. Liked my beer."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday with a group of 6. We didn't have a reservation and had to wait one hour. Unfortunately for the restaurant being pretty big it seems like they only have a few party tables. When the food came out it was just okay. Had the stuffed pretzels as an app (those were the best part) then the reisch burger - which was just a square hash brown on top of the burger - just okay. And the mild wings bucket - very dry and lacked sauce. The service was good but the food fell below expectations on flavor."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great selection of beers and interesting sandwiches on the menu. I love the turkey/goat cheese wrap! Rocky River Brewing Company's fries have also stolen my heart and are in the running for the best fries I've ever had. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place gets so many bad reviews.  The hefeweizen is really good - I'm a huge hefeweizen fan.  The food is pretty good, nothing incredible, but it's a brewery so their main focus is more on their beers!"}
{"text":"RRBC has a large menu. As I was looking it over many options struck me as appealing. Having now tried one of the entrees however, my expectations of all the others that sounded good have gone down. Perhaps this is more of a place for burgers than entrees.   I tried the Pretzel Crusted Chicken entree. The portion was large; two big pieces of white boneless meat. The pretzel crust however fell right off the chicken and basically turned into a pile of breadcrumbs on the plate. I appreciate thin breading, but I do want the flavors from it. The overwhelming flavor of the dish was the mustard sauce, which tasted pretty much unaltered from your traditional mustard. The dish came with your basic unflavored steamed broccoli and a big pile of potatoes. I thought at $15.99 the price was a bit too high and TGI Fridays could have done just as well.  Also note that while the fish and chips special is running, the fish and chips on the extra paper menu is frozen. The one in the menu for just $0.51 more is fresh our waitress told us.  Nothing to write home about here, except the nearly comical situation at the host stand. Four of them at the host stand; one of them standing on the customer side of the podium with her back to the door and three of them had drink glasses on the top of the podium. And none of them said goodbye to us as we left."}
{"text":"Went out with some friends on a Friday night.  Our babes both got ribs and wouldn't stop talking about how delicious they were for the rest of the night.  I had the blackened tuna steak sandwich (w/ a great sun-dried tomato aioli).  Overall, a good meal, some good beers, and a good time."}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved to Westpark, this is our new favorite place nearby.  Food was all excellent and the IPA was perfect!"}
{"text":"Decided to go here because of the many gluten free options. After talking with our waitress I decided to go with the cheese pizza (I never order pizza at restaurants because they are always GARBAGE) but she insisted the crust was very popular and the cheese sounded interesting because there was feta and many other kinds. So I thought sure, why not!   It was SOOOO good! Even my non gf boyfriend ate two pieces and said it was fantastic. He ordered a hamburger which was also good, so now we have a new place to add to our gf friendly restaurants!"}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets even 2 starts is because the other people I was with had burgers and liked them. Why did I have to go rogue and order grilled chicken?   Went with a group on Friday. The place was pretty busy, they said they would text me when our table was ready even though I was in the chair right by the hostess stand. As in, they were looking at me the whole time. I guess this really irritated me because they didn't even ask if I cared to give out my number, they just demanded it and I didn't really care at that moment to argue because I thought there was deeper meaning. There wasn't.  Service was sub-par, waitress was mostly m.i.a.  But on to the food...  I ordered the grilled chicken parmesan. Described as grilled chicken topped with cheese and bread crumbs. Now, I thought it would be a small amount. Literally, and I mean literally, when the plate came you didn't even know there was chicken on it. All you could see was gelatinous cheese topped with an over-abundance of bread crumbs. Remember when the stay-puffed marshmallow man exploded in Ghostbusters? That's what it looked like.   After brushing the cheese monster off to finally find the chicken (as if I were digging for gold), I took a bite. And then had to drink my water because it was so dry.  I tried, I really did, but this chicken was SO DRY it wasn't even palatable. Mind you, I've never sent anything back to a kitchen in my entire life. This went back. And a manager never even came over to apologize for the dish. This was by far and away the poorest excuse for chicken that has ever existed and a disgrace for the animal that gave its life.  If you can't do it right, take it off the menu, because I saw another diner on here complain about the same dish."}
{"text":"Very impressed for lunch. Unique menu including your standard bar menu with a twist. Highly recommend the Thai Chicken salad (add cucumbers). Perfect balance of spicy and sweet. Christmas ale with a cinnamon sugar rim was the cherry on top! Quick and friendly service. I know this place usually has a long wait for dinner, so suggest trying to sneak in at off peak hours to enjoy the deliciousness."}
{"text":"Actually they surprisingly had very good food. There beer is great too (I am a huge microbrew beer snob).  I took one star away because I have had better microbrew beer at one other place.  But you be sure, you will not have a bad meal or drinks if you go here.  I recommend the sampler... I have NEVER seen a place that gives you a sample of ALL of their beers! (usually you have to choose)"}
{"text":"the best BAR that's not a bar. Excellent food, excellent vibe, excellent staff, love George, Mark & Bob (one of the owners). They let my son behind the bar when it was slow... we always take out of town guests here. LOVE this place! You must go!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat with great daily specials! My son and I go for $6 burger night and it's well worth it. The buffalo cauliflower is amazing and the so is the coconut curry bowl."}
