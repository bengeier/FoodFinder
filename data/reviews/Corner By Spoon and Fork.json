{"text":"This place is great, just kind of in a location where a place this nice shouldn't really be...but in a way it's nice so it's kinda secluded (even though it's on a main road if you blink you'll miss it, the sign is black and it's in a plaza with clothing stores). It's surprisingly very hipster inside and there are lots of food choices aside from sushi burritos and poke bowls, which is what people usually go here for. 

They also have macarons and other desserts in the cafe! Worth a visit :)"}
{"text":"Sushi burritos. Poke bowls. Bubble tea. And a bunch of other stuff if you're not feeling those first three. Definitely going back and definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"Went here last night with my boyfriend around 8 pm.

We had the $14.99 steak & chicken special
+ bought a coconut cream pie for my mom. This place has an awesome dessert selection and they look and taste like a fresh home made baked good.

Ginger beer and Cola drinks are awesome, and the bottles are very INSTA pic tumblr cute. 

The meal came on a steaming hot skillet and contained a  thin piece of steak and chicken ( both small pieces probably why they added both to the meal .. I'm not mad though Im a person that loves variety) 

The sides included corn and fries + melted cheese on top and onions. 

Honestly I've never eaten anything like this before, but it was awesome and super yummy. 

I like this place a lot.

ALSO . Tons of seating area options , booths , low tables and chairs and cafeteria style tables. ( Long tables with sockets every 5 ft ( awesome for getting some grub in and taking care of homework and adult duties"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch - once to have a sushi burrito on a Friday and the second for pasta on a Sunday. Both times I was here with a larger group of people (5-8), and there was always more than enough seating. 

They have half a counter for sushi burritos, which I opted to build my own with the selection of fresh fish and other ingredients. It ends up being a large sushi roll sliced in half. If you don't eat fast enough, the seaweed at the bottom gets all soggy (like a burrito).

During my second visit, I ordered the smoked salmon and trout bowtie pasta, which was all ready to be eaten. I have no complaints about my kind of comfort food.

All staff were friendly and attentive as they took orders and brought food to tables.

I'd recommend this place for a casual meal with friends or coffee date."}
{"text":"I use to love Corner and have made numerous recommendations to my friends and Co-workers however I had an extremely bad experience recently. I ordered a beef taco and a spicy salmon taco. For the beef taco I saw they were putting a white sauce with dark spots of some sort but thought nothing of it as I assumed it was their own special sauce. I picked up the beef taco first and noticed an odd smell but thought maybe it was the seasoning they used on the beef. I took my first bite and I instantly spat it out as there was a foul taste that went along with the foul smell. Turns out that white sauce with dark spots was moldy sour cream. I brought it up to the cash counter and told them something was wrong with the order and at this point I'm gagging . The manager instantly said oh yea I can smell it the sour cream is bad...he then proceeded with asking if I wanted to eat something else. By this time I abruptly ran to the bathroom to throw up. When I came back all the manager could say was we are sorry would you like us to make something else for you? I obviously did not have the appetite to eat anything else so I asked for a refund. At no point did they offer me a drink or ask if I was ok. Will definitely NOT return ever and this is very unfortunate as my friends and I go here for lunch pretty frequently."}
{"text":"I ordered a FETTUCCINE PAISANO which was supposed to come with spicy chicken, veggies, capers, olives & tomatoes. Instead, I got a pasta with somewhat tasty white sauce but no spicy chicken, veggies,  olives & tomatoes."}
{"text":"I don't even remember how many times I've been for our breakfast, no any complaints since the first time, definitely will keep coming and will recommend to friends. I hope they could keep doing well on the food quality."}
{"text":"Who would think such a gem is tucked away in a non descript place on Dundas? 

Been here a few times, love the food, good quality and friendly staff.  Can't lie,  also love the free coffee with breakfast. I've had their baked goods,  egg dishes, got to try the sushi next."}
{"text":"Three of us met up for an early lunch as I was in Mississauga for a meeting.  Aimed to beat the lunch crowd, and as my meeting was for 1pm, I got to Corner at 1140am, and the place was quiet.

We wanted to order stuff to share;  but the Mum Bowl station only had 1 meat ready at the time (peanut chicken) which we ordered.  As they said it would take 10-15 minutes before the station was fully ready, we ordered a couple of baked pasta dishes to make up an order for 3.  

You can upgrade your order with either a soup or pop.  But my aunt told me that meals come with coffee.  We upgraded one of the meals to include a pop (+$1.49), and indeed got two coffee mugs for self-serve coffee upon request!  This was an unexpected bonus!

The Mum Bowl was really good - we added 4 veggies (edamame; broccoli;  yams; corn) and opted for the red curry sauce on top of pad thai noodles.  It was excellent and all three of us agreed it was the best of the dishes.  We would all go for a Mum Bowl again.

Of the other two dishes, they were just OK, and nothing to write home about.  The dishes were somewhat reminiscent of HK cafe style dishes, but did not taste as such.  The breaded pork cutlet was OK.  It was nice that they already pre-sliced the cutlet into strips, but the tomato made the dish a little too tangy.  Likewise with the Penne Bolognese - the meat sauce was more runny than thick.  

I did look to see how the lines were during prime lunch hour, and it wasn't terribly busy.  Probably because it was early in the work week.  My cousin had previously tried the sushi/rito and breakfasts and felt they were \"meh\".  We didn't order the sushi burrito this time, thinking it would be difficult to share among 3 people.  This is something I'll give a try to next time I visit.

I think Corner is a nice addition to this part of Mississauga, where there is a lot of fast food and a few franchise restos, but not filled with decent dining options in a comfortable environment.  The self-serve aspect makes for faster service, and the menu is varied enough that you can visit often without repeating your order.  The prices are reasonable (3 entrees + 1 pop upgrade came to ~$31.)

Overall, as expected with all the Spoon and Forks I've visited, the decor is modern, and there is a certain level of cleanliness and service that you can expect.  The restaurant is quite spacious, and I can imagine that I could manage to sit and do some work here if in the area.

When I arrived at my meeting, I mentioned Corner to clients and none of them had visited even though its so close to their office.  When I described its location, they were surprised!  The signage of \"Corner\" in orange against a black background does not leverage the Spoon and Fork name adequately to draw attention.  But now they will look for it for their next lunch outing."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Everything I've tried from the sushi burrito, to the poke bowl, Thai bowl and sandwiches have all been delicious. Not yet disappointed. I heard their pastas are really good too, which I will be trying next. I hope they stick around because it's a great spot to pick up some takeout."}
{"text":"I like this place, I've had the sushi burrito twice.  I do wish it was a bit more budget friendly but I think it's still reasonable. Nice ambience and decor"}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant. It has a nice casual ambience. I had the classic breakfast with two eggs, toast and sausage for $3.99 which includes coffee (it's special at the moment, not sure how long it will last). The meal was very good. The eggs were cooked just right. The coffee was good. I will come back for lunch.

Update: To the Ricky's question, yes that was my first time a your restaurant. I've been back a couple of times since. I had the one of the lunch bowls and it was great. I have to say your staff is really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"stopped by a couple of times and really like the variety of dishes here. Prices are also reasonable."}
{"text":"First time having a sushi burrito and it was definitely worth coming here for it. I've seen Mississauga Chinatown had some but the quality didn't look as great, specially the establishment. 

Upon first arrival of the corner restaurant you get a modern look thinking this is a high end restaurant where you sit first and order, but it's the opposite like others say. Order first at the counter and bring it to your table of choice. The sushi burrito experience, was really fresh, tons of flavours and actually more contents than expected. People were saying it's better to get hand rolls at a AYCE buffet but this quality tastes much better Imo. Haven't tried other items they offer but the sushi burrito is a must try when coming here."}
{"text":"I had the Garden Bennie and quite enjoyed it. Nice quiet place with good prices and decent food. It will probably be my go to breakfast place from now on. I'm looking forward to trying some of the other menu options."}
{"text":"Tried this place again for lunch. Must say the whole aspect of service is going down. The take out containers have shrunk in size. So you get less for the same price of $8.99+tax. Went to get free coffee but they had run out of cream. Coffee had cooled down by the time the server replenished it. 
Could go to T&T supermarket and get same amount of food from the hot table for 7.99+tax"}
{"text":"This is a review of a new menu item for them, the sushitto.  This is a sushi roll that is the size of a burrito.  The first time I saw a sushi-burrito was on Facebook being featured from a restaurant in NYC.  I couldn't wait for it to arrive in Toronto. The thought of all that sushi rice, and all that seaweed wrapped around sushi-grade tuna completely blew my mind.  And when I saw a review posted on Facebook earlier in the week, I knew I had to try it.  But drive all the way to Mississauga? Fortunately for me, I had a meeting before lunch in the west end.  Score!  

Walking into the restaurant it is extremely clean and surprisingly large.  I was confused as to the process but quickly determined this is a counter service restaurant where you order your meal and then pay for it.  I had to ask the staff what was in the Lobster Roll as the ingredients are not listed anywhere.  I guess since it's a new menu item, they don't have a menu.  After learning about this and determining there's nothing I'm allergic to, I decided on the lobster roll.

The roll was quickly made, and looked to be bursting with ingredients.  Wrapped in paper, it was then cut in half and plated with a small dish with a package of soy sauce and wasabi.  Make sure you ask for more soy sauce than the one pack they give you because if you put all of the wasabi pack in your dish, you will have a wasabi emergency with only one pack of soy sauce.

Taking a bite into the sushitto, it's everything I thought it would be.  Just the right amount of kick.  Then I dipped it in the soy with wasabi, and had a wasabi emergceny.... oh dear.  All in all, if you sit prepared with enough soy sauce, you'll have a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  But the real question is how is this a buritto, and not a giant sushi roll?  About 2 hours later, this sushitto is still sitting in your stomach as often the case with burittos and you have no desire to eat for a week!  Yummmmmmm"}

FOOD IS INCREDIBLE 
TRY THE MUM BOWL
FILL IT UP WITH AMAZING TOPPINGS 
take a vegetarian friend here, 2 of the pics are the tofu eggplant pad Thai mum bowl and the other one is chili chicken 

atmosphere is nice and clean and the price is very well fitted for the portion. 

can't wait to go back and try the tacos and or sushi burrito!"}
{"text":"Their food is good. The only thing I don't like is that even if you go 1.5 hrs before the closing time , they run out of menu items (rice) and convinces you to take noodles because they won't be re filling their rice . The lady told me its because \"we are closing soon\" when clearly they still had 1.5 hrs till the closing."}
{"text":"The food was a 4 star, environment a 4 star and the new guy behind the counter made this place a 3 star. It was our first time there so I was a bit confused to what I can choose from for the unagi sushi burrito and tuna poke bowl. Every time I tried to ask the counter guy, he frowned and made exasperated expressions. Plus He never told me choose your own ingredient resulted in $1 more."}
{"text":"I have so much to write about this place. This place made me fall in love with having breakfast everyday, usually I skip the breakfast but if I visit this place I have no reasons to skip my breakfast. 

When you enter this place they have three different sections to place your order. If you walk straight from the entrance you enter the sushi order. On the left is the breakfast section and right is the Mums bowl. 

My favourite place is always sushi, as soon as I read \"sushi\" I did not see anywhere and walked straight to place my order. The surprise for me wasn't that a breakfast place serving sushi but what was surprising is the \"sushi burrito\". At first I wasn't sure how the sushi would taste, but they know how do it RIGHT. I got the rising sun and it was good, but the price wasn't justifying it. I think its a bit pricy for that burrito. You won't be disappointed having that sushi burrito.

We had ordered other things like Lobster taco, Salman egg Benedict and Fettuccine amore. Everything I ordered was good. Nothing disappointed me. 

The best so this experience was they give free coffee with your breakfast.

{"text":"I love this sort of place. A quiet food court in an even quieter mall. Most people beeline for the Whole Foods salad bar. Do. Not. Sleep on this place. It's better than it ought to be.
The concept is familiar: a hot table keeps various Asian dishes warm, you chose one or two items plus noodles/rice and vegetables. But hiding on the spread is some really excellent Thai food.
First: there's no up charge for pad thai noodles (I'm looking at you, Thai Island!). Second: the pad thai is *actually* delicious. I can't figure it out. It should be a congealed mass of gummy rice noddles tinted with ketchup BUT IT'S NOT. It has that tamarind tang and just enough oil to keep the noodles separate but not greasy. The kicker: when you get to the register there is a topping bar with so many tasty things. Yes, cilantro and peanuts, but also crispy shallots, toasted coconut, even those itty bitty dried shrimp.
The red curry chicken was nice; good comfort food. The veg are steamed which is a healthy bonus (the sweet potatoes were roasted, which shows good judgement on their part).
Part of me hopes no one reads this review so I can keep the tasty, generous portions all to myself. But seriously, do yourself a favour and check this one out."}
{"text":"New spot in town, and so far so good, I'm impressed and would make a visit back. A very fitting name as it is pretty much at the corner of a strip plaza in a older part of town (across from Laser Quest plaza), good amount of parking. 

Highlights:
- Free WiFi
- Casual eatery with modern decor; good place to chat with friends or go on a lunch break
- Reasonable prices for good portions, most of the menu's entrees below $10 (breakfast is even cheaper); in fact, I brought home leftovers from a $8.99 meal (no service charge since this is a self-serve place!)
- Staff are welcoming and friendly, despite this being a self-serve place; since I was indecisive about my protein choice, the staff was kind enough to let me sample the 2

My pick is the $8.99 \"Mum bowls\" where you customize your own starch (noodles, rice, couscous, quinoa), vegetables (pick 4 such as broccoli,cauliflower, corn, green beans, beets, sweet potato etc), protein (I did lemongrass chicken), and sauce (I did red curry). 

I also enjoyed the seared pork chop with rice $8.99 (combo + $2.49 with Caesar salad with unexpected more croutons, parmesan, and bacon bits). Sushi also appeared to be quite fresh and competitively priced.

All-in-all, surprisingly better than expected in terms of food-for-value given that it's a cafe. Still probably could experiment with more offerings on their menu including drinks (ie. bubble tea and the likes)
Hopefully there will be more options (ie. drinks like bubble tea, etc) in the future."}
{"text":"Honestly love the ambience here. Nice décor, comfortable seating and friendly staff. I like that they have a mixture of western and Asian cuisine. I noticed the western menu has a selection of brunch, to entrees like pasta etc. The Asian cuisines offers the famous sushi burrito, which my husband chose to indulge in. I also saw they offered Poke bowls, and thai bowls - all which looked really appetizing. The ingredients were fresh and everything was made to order. 

Once you order your food and receive it, you pay and choose a seat. 

Very pleased, will definitely be returning next time."}
{"text":"I'm a huge sushi burrito fan. Glad it came to Mississauga! 

Let's be transparent, I saw an ad on Facebook, \"new sushi burrito\" in Mississauga and my inner fat kid said YES PLEASE ! 

Ambiance: it's modern, newly finished and a lot of space for a \"fast food\" restaurant. It's casual and comfortable and the best part NO LINES. Great for families.

Parking: its in a plaza, tons of space

Service & Price: friendly staff & fair pricing

Sushi Burrito Time: it was amazing! I've had a fair share of sushi burritos in the past but this was delightful. Good job to Spoon and Fork for creating my next addiction. There's 6 flavours. I ordered the Rising Sun for $11.99. Well worth it! Fresh and delicious  

I found my new \"corner\" spot to eat * pun intended* Looking forward to tasting other yummy food items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Came here last weekend with my fiancé. Always wanted to try this place since I saw it when driving by the area. Checked out the reviews and it seemed promising!!

Since it was my first time, didn't really know how to order or how it worked (I mean, how hard can it be right?!) There are two lines....one to order from the main menu and another to order the sushi burrito & mum bowls. Sooooo do I order first, get my food then pay? ORRR do I order and pay then they bring it to me? What if I wanted to order from both sides?  It was sooo confusing....either that or I'm just stupid turns out I did it all wrong but whatever....I got my food at the end which is all that matters!!

I ordered the rising sun sushi burrito and my fiancé ordered the 'big breakfast' (see pics). He got a lot of food for the price he paid! He was super satisfied to say the least! As for the sushi burrito....it's what I expected, basically a giant hand roll! Very tasty!! 

Their entire menu looks delish!! Will have to come back and try the rest!"}
{"text":"Came here to try out their famous sushi burritos and poke bowls! My sister and I both ordered the Rising Sun (she got the sushi burrito while I got the poke bowl). They were pretty okay - hers had a lot of salmon inside but mine lacked the amount she had. I wish I could have gotten more roe and seaweed salad though haha!
Overall, a bit on the pricey side. I was also slightly upset with the naming of Rising Sun, considering the meaning and significance of that flag during the reign of imperial Japan and the atrocities committed in WWII 
My parents got a penne cheese pasta with broccoli cheddar soup, as well as a smoked salmon sandwich. Also pricier, but slightly cheaper than ours!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday. Was pleasantly surprised by how tasty and filling my sushi burrito was. I got the rising sun, which i think is any burrito with salmon sashimi. Other toppings i choose included spinach, sea weed salad, carrots, cabbage, imitation crab and spicy mayo. I'm not a fancy food critic but to me the ingredients were fresh, and in general the burrito was delicious. I would defiantly come again! But its important to note that near the end of the burrito, it gets messy. You basically are eating out of your hands, so I recommend keeping it in the paper :p."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since it opened. And this place has not disappointed us in any way. This is one of my favourite fusion restaurants. The food is always fresh and delicious!  The MUM Bowl is a must!  Now we just tried their build your own Salmon PokeBowl and let me tell you, that was soooo good! Another must!  Their to go sushi is pretty good. The pasta and breakfast is descent minus the mac and cheese which was excellent but unfortunately it has been removed from the menu. The array of desserts, biscuits, scones, muffins and danishes are simply amazing!  The staff are friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"After seeing a viral NYC sushi burrito video, I've been searching high & low everywhere to try it somewhere in the GTA but all options were either pop-up shops or food trucks (which I do not have time to follow & chase).

When we heard Corner By Spoon and Fork started serving this we immediately rushed there (from Markham) to check it out on a Friday night and we were not disappointed at all!

The decor was very modern and clean with a faux fireplace, think Starbucks style but much larger.

Ordering Process:
It was intimidating as first since there were so many options to choose from, but the chef was very helpful. There are 5-6 recommended combinations or you can create your own custom sushi burrito. For custom you can choose 1 protein + 1 green + 4 toppings + 1 sauce. I ended up building my own which consists of sashimi tuna + arugula + inari age (fried tofu skin) + avocado + tempura bits + julienne mango + spicy mayo. When the food arrived it was served with a soy sauce and wasabi packet. The total came out around $12-$15 which was a little expensive but expected as there are only a few places that serve sushi burrito.

Food:
The food was amazing, all the ingredients were very fresh and the nori was not too chewy or too soft, it was perfect for holding all of the ingredients together while still being able to snap apart as you bite into the burrito. I would definitely revisit to try more combinations of their sushi burrito.

I become such a fan that I made my own spreadsheet which includes all proteins/greens/toppings options to build my own sushi burrito combinations for my next visit!

Second Visit:
I came here a 2nd time hoping to try something else on the menu, the seared pork chops with fried rice. I am very disappointed in this dish, the fried rice was bland and the pork chops was dry. I would recommend sticking to sushi burrito if you visit Corner."}
{"text":"Me and my wife Visited this weekend with family friends. The friends enjoyed our choice of restaurant for both the ambience and quality of food. Also special appreciation to the elderly lady who served the breakfast to our table. She was very accommodating and caring. 
I would come back again with family and friend given the casual ambience and the size of the seating area."}
{"text":"What a neat place! I came here for a birthday date night with the hubby, and we had a great time trying something new. The evening was awesome because: 1. we were baby free (which has nothing to do with the restaurant, but I just wanted to note lol), 2. the place was quiet but not empty, which meant we could hear each other talk, 3. the staff was friendly and helpful, and 4. the food was yum!

We arrived late - around 8:30 (they close at 10), and spent some time looking over the choices. While they have a lot of variety (hot food and sushi stuff), I had my heart set on a sushi burrito and a poke bowl. The signage around the two is pretty confusing - I wasn't sure how to order and was looking everywhere for a how-to, but the person behind the counter explained that you could pick one of the already defined option, or you can create your own for \"$1 more\", which in itself is confusing since the different sushi burritos displayed were differently priced depending on the protein.

I ended up picking the salmon sushi burrito and the salmon poke bowl (substituting tuna for the salmon). We paid and got two cups for water, some cutlery, and sat ourselves down in a booth. The place is large and the seating options are varied (booth, square tables, round tables, coffee table and couches), so you can really take your pick. 

We spent some time laughing over the pre-packaged wasabi, but let me tell you that wasabi is INSANE. Like, the second most spicy wasabi we've ever had. It was SO GOOD. 

Overall, we had a great time - the food was delicious and filling (for me, the Mr had to have some more food when he got home), and the flavours were great. If you're excited for the poke bowl, I should mention it's not like actual Hawaiian poke, so you should reset the expectations if that's what you're looking for. But it's an interesting concept nonetheless, and I felt it was decent value for money - probably moreso if you're coming for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Went there with pretty high expectations but quite disappointed. I ordered 3 flavours of Sushi burrito:  salmon, tuna and lobster. All of them have way too much leaf veggies, I will replace some of them with pickled cucumber, beet, ginger, turnip to create diverse layered flavour and texture, it was so boring chewing just leafs. The sauces were too salty and too spicy, make the salmon and tuna less interesting, lost the natural salmon cream taste. Overall, feel very much like a fast food chain. 

Compare to another place's sushi burrito in Mississauga, I definitely chose the other one."}
{"text":"My husband and I regularly get take out from this place. So far I have only tried their sushi burrito (the Rising Sun is excellent - I ask for less of the shredded cabbage) but I am looking forward to trying the all-day breakfast next time I dine in. The sushi burrito design has improved since we first tried this place out - they now add an extra piece of seaweed which keeps the burrito from bursting into a delicious mess as you're eating it. They have also since added sushi tacos to the menu.

They also serve alcohol ($5 glasses of wine!) which makes - perfect low-key brunch setting for catching up with my girlfriends. The only downside is that the free wi-fi basically requires you to post a check-in, but this can easily worked around by changing the privacy settings for the post (sorry creepers)."}
{"text":"I went on a Wednesday night and it was pretty quiet but I like how cozy the place feels. I ordered the ungai sushi burrito and just added spicy mayo. Honestly the best ever, so good! Plus it's so filling and inexpensive which is the best part. 

The way it is here, when you walk in on your left is Canadian food and breakfast items and right next to it is the Thai section where you could get the sushi burrito. Once you have placed your order and paid you can seat yourself, so essentially like cafeteria style. I definitely will be returning for another sushi burrito, I can't get over how nice it was!"}
{"text":"I've had the sushi burrito twice so far and each time i fall in love with it again!!! If you love sushi you will love this for sure. They don't have too many options, but they are very good so it doesn't even matter if you get the same one everytime. If you like spicy food i definitely recommend Rising Sun and Flaming Dragon! One sushi burrito lasts me 2 meals which is amazing! So you will definitely be filled up with one sushi burrito!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the family and we all wanted to try their poke bowl - it didn't disappoint. Good selection of toppings, fresh ingredients and the service was fast. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Came to try the sushi burrito, and it did not disappoint!! I came twice already and each time I \"make my own\". The salmon is fresh, the atmosphere is inviting and the burrito itself was so good. I can wait to come again!"}
{"text":"The location is pretty deceiving as it is located near the Dixie GO Station in a retail plaza. The interior is fairly modern and it is a cafe type set-up. 

We came to try out the sushi burritos. They give you the option of choosing one of their sushi burrito combinations or creating your own. There are a ton of different options you can choose to create your own, but if you're indecisive like me, you can pick one of their combinations.

 I tried the Unagi Dance sushi burrito and was pleasantly surprised. This was the first time trying a sushi burrito, but in comparison to regular sushi, it was delicious. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Had a poke bowl here. Hooooo boy, it was so delicious.

I got salmon as the fish for the bowl. It was super fresh and not \"fishy\" at all. They seasoned it with deliciousness before putting it in the bowl.

The rice was delicious and soft. Not one undercooked grain! Which was great because I abhor undercooked rice.

I got mandarins, pickled cucumber, cabbage, seaweed salad  and roe in my bowl. 

I was pleasantly surprised when they said the roe was already part of the bowl :) I love, love, love roe.

The flavours melded together so dang beautifully. I'm coming here again!

You may think the price is a little steep but it's so worth it. The bowl is more filling than it seems. My stomach was full and I was left with a smile on my face. 

Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"I tried one of their pasta dishes and my friend had the peppercorn beef on rice. Both dishes were average. The pasta took a while to arrive. We will probably return if we are in the area but we won't be coming out of our way to eat here again."}
{"text":"I would describe this as a higher class food court and a fusion between Basil Box and Panera.

What I ordered was something called a \"Mum's bowl\" which is essentially make your own Asian dish. It's a custom bowl where you get to choose:
*Your grain such as brown rice, white rice, or noodles
*Choice of protein (tofu, beef, chicken, shrimp)
*4 vegetables

It is a reasonable price at 8.49.
They also have sandwiches, coffee and desserts similar to any other cafe.  

The overall atmosphere reminds me of a classier Panera.  However, everything has cheese or eggs in it with the exception of the Mum's bowl, so this isn't necessarily the best place if you are on a vegan diet.  

Verdict: Not bad if you are in jam, but nothing special either."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening to try out the Poke bowls with my husband and baby (obviously, babe didn't eat the poke bowl lol). It wasn't too busy at all when we came around 4:30pm. 

The displays were so clean and welcoming.

I was pleased to see that they had high chairs for my son that were clean and all had working straps. 

All the staff had smiles and despite not being very busy, they were busy doing something whether it was serving, cleaning or organizing. There was A LOT of staff (I think I counted 7 or 8) on the floor but I guess they need that many people to be around at this time? One girl was cleaning the tables, the legs of the tables AND the floor- talk about thorough. I personally think this isn't a good look for a restaurant, especially when people are eating close by and should be saved for closing time. The restaurant was already quite clean and it looked like they were just trying to keep her busy. That was my only little tiff about the ambience but other than that, it was fabulous.

The toppings were plentiful, fresh and generous. I liked the size of the bowls as well - they were quite large and made me full at the end of the meal (I find most places that use take out bowls never leave me satisfied). I really liked the fact that they allow you so many different options for the main part of the bowl (white rice, brown rice, greens or half and half). The spicy mayo had a nice kick to it and the wasabi cucumber was more mild than I would've liked for it to be. 

Right now my son is in his screaming stage but not one person made us feel unwelcome. One staff member even came by to give him a high five! Super friendly and great food! Can't wait to come back and try the sushi burrito or mum bowl."}
{"text":":) really good comfort food pasta for a good price. The service was really nice too that they brought the food to us."}
{"text":"Very disappointed coming back to Corner because they cut down on the amount of protein in your sushi burrito. They use I think a 1/4 cup and it wasn't even full when they scooped it. They used to put two handfuls of protein in your burrito and that's why I loved this place so much, I understand it could get pricey to use so much protein but don't set the bar high and then start going downhill :(
Will return but will return as a sad customer"}
{"text":"These guys just gained some regulars for breakfast! I was really impressed with my meal. Everything on my plate to the coffee (complimentary) was delicious! The sausage was amazing, french toast was made to perfection and the hash browns were seasoned very well. I didn't even need ketchup! 

The prices are really good!! The concept is similar to giggling tomatoes in Brampton where you order at the front and grab a seat with a number on your table then they bring you your food. 

The restaurant also offers Japanese, Thai, bakery items, desserts and even the famous SUSHI BURRITO!!! 

Staff is super friendly and one staff even made a trip around the restaurant to find out how everyone was doing even though it was a sit yourself type. She even talked to us personally which made our experience even better.

Thank you, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the vibe of this place. The ambience is diner meets coffee shop. The booths are comfy and intimate. The restaurant has huge windows and has very bright natural lighting. The food here is fantastic and affordable. There is also free wifi and outlets throughout the restaurant, so it is the perfect place for a study session or just to get some work done. Staff were wonderful. Above all, this place is very clean!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for any meal of the day! Well priced for the quality of food great staff and the decor is almost too good! Usually quiet with unique music playing sometimes relaxing."}
{"text":"Up until last week, this was on regular lunch rotation. We stopped going here because a couple of us had bad stomach pain. Good timing because they also just increased their prices and are pushy on the upsell. Avoid sushi bowls and careful of what you order :s"}
{"text":"They have everything on the poké craze - tacos, burritos, bowls, and mum bowls. Customer service has greatly improved, and its one of my favourite poke places compared to the ones in toronto. Still an awesome place with a great atmosphere. Superb bowls!! Def recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and the two times I was here,  I was happy with the food and service. I enjoyed the sushi burrito and I am glad that they have this in Mississauga- I do not need to go downtown for this! I made my own sushi burrito rather than trying their set options. I had a both the tuna and salmon in the burrito so they did a half and half. I also chose half and half for the veges topping. This is great as I am rather indecisive so the custom option is a plus! I was quite satisfied with the sushi burrito but I must admit the cost is a bit much and I could see for most males, they would still be hungry. The concept is great and I love the sushi machine for the seaweed paper and rice. 
In addition to the oh so popular sushi burrito, they also have all day breakfast, pasta items and rice/noodle bowl. On my second visit, I wanted to have the pasta because it reminded me of those Hong Kong style baked casseroles which I absolutely love. I gave into the Mum bowl. The Mum bowl is all about customization which is definitely down my alley. You can do half half on your rice or noodle option.. And I really like how they have the purple rice- something different. They have various options for the protein and you get 4 choices for their veges- you definitely won't be bored with the flavours and items to choose from. The Mum bowl's portion is spot on and you won't be left hungry. Thumbs up! 

Also I wanted to add is that the restaurant itself is spacious and modern. There is a good amount of seating. I also have to point out on their high tables since not a lot of Asian inspired restaurants have this option- again, another Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"went there in 2015 and the food was great

went there in 2016 and the food has all changed using much cheaper chicken, cheaper rice for the sushi and cheap/old beef"}
{"text":"Seems like the Spoon and Fork empire is growing by the day with about half a dozen locations (of various foods but mostly Asian) across the West end. This is their latest foray on the \"fast food\" bandwagon while somehow simultaneously tackling another food trend; the great sushi burrito! But you can never doubt these guys given their successful track record.

This place reminds me of a typical Panera Bread only there's no bread here. You walk in, order your stuff from the counters, they deliver it to your table and when you're done you return your food trays. There's no service here and that's exactly what fast food is.

I ordered their specialty baked pork chop in a tomato sauce. This is a very typical HK Style cafe dish and perhaps one of my favs. I love their interpretation on this with fresh herbs, real cheese and tomatoes, it really brings it up to the next level. The dish had so much flavour and texture to it I was so blown away that I didn't even mind that the pork was slightly overcooked. The rice in the dish is absolutely done to perfection; al-dente with individual grains while still just barely soft enough to eat. The second dish wasn't quite as successful; the sushi burrito. It was a big giant burrito of everything and the kitchen sink that turned out to taste like...well... everything and the kitchen sink but not in a great way. There was so much going on with so many odd textures and flavours, it made it extremely confusing what exactly it is you are eating. So much so, I couldn't even taste the main ingredient (lobster in this case). The pickled vegetables added a surprising and unpleasant experience of sourness to the dish. The lack of uniformity of the size of the vegetables really made it difficult to eat and presented strange textures. The wrapper in this case is a giant piece of seaweed in which case was very overpowering in flavour. There are occasions when more is better but in the case of the sushi burrito I think less might be more.

I would definitely come back to eat the baked rice but would definitely skip the burritos."}
{"text":"We were just shopping by the Dixie outlet and needed a place for dinner. Yelpers had this place rated pretty high so I figured I'd give it a try. My fellow Yelpers never lead me wrong. 

We were the first ones here before the dinner rush so it was completely empty. We got greeted and since we looked lost, a staff kindly explained the different menus. It's like an Asian Italian partnership version of Panera bread. It's a little strange. There's desserts and Italian food as you walk in and straight ahead you get the sushi taco and burrito.. Then next to it looks like cooked Asian-thai food.

The cooked foods didn't look too appealing. Very oily, fried and just not very fresh or vibrant. The curry looked good but I'll have to try it next time.

This time I ordered a spicy salmon taco and the unagi (eel) taco. The sauce in the latter tasted very alcoholic so I think it wasn't mixed well, but everything else about it was amazing!! I opted for two tacos so I could try different things. My boyfriend went straight for the spicy tuna burrito which was like a giant maki roll. They really stuff these tacos and burritos and I think the value is there. Fresh ingredients, made to order, and they toast the taco shell. :)

I really enjoyed my visit
 Hope to stop by again real soon!!!

PS. There's a sushi burrito hype going around and there's good and bad so I was a bit weary to try. Luckily, this place has a great balance and no soggy mess. I think hypes and trends are worth trying cause you might discover something new to enjoy!"}
{"text":"If I don't eat here when I am in Mississauga, well then, it just is a bad trip to Mississauga.  Great sushi, salads, bowls, etc.  never a bad meal"}
{"text":"Came here for the sushi burritos. Large place, well decorated, but confusing set up. They have a few walk up bars for you to order food. We were looking for signage and instructions on the sushi burrito and poke bowls - none whatsoever. They only have a few already made samples of what sushi burritos they have and what it looks like and it's up to you to decipher whats inside it. At mi'hito sushi laboratory at Courtney park they have large menu boards as to what ingredients are included in each sushi burrito. In the rising sun burrito at mi'hito it comes with two proteins... The guy at corner looked at me weird when I asked for both salmon and tuna but did it for me anyways when I said mi'hito did it.

 I ordered the poke bowl, thought that you just made your own bowl and added whatever toppings you want. But you only get a select few and everything is extra. Overall, unclear as to what you can and cannot add to your bowl. Better experience at mi'hito."}
{"text":"Lots of parking, big place. Hesitant to try the sushi burritos but maybe next time. Got the mum bowl. Nothing special though.

When I saw spoon and fork - I assumed it was a decent place and it is.

Came here with friends for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"The location is pretty good. Interior is set-up quite nice. Very clean and open. 

I ordered the Spicy Flaming Dragon. The taste is pretty okay. I wish they incorporated one or two ingredient that can make the dish filling. 

I'd go back again if I'm in the area. 

Definitely a good local spot."}
{"text":"This restaurant seems to have it all! They offer breakfast, lunch, dinner and cafe items. We stopped by for a late lunch and had poke bowls and sushi burrito. The bowls were delicious, you can choose your base (white or brown rice, half and half or salad), protein and 4 toppings. You can also customize your sushi burrito but we choose the spicy tuna one. If you aren't a fan of sushi, they also offer warm Chinese food (teriyaki, sweet and sour pork and many more options) and Italian food as well (pastas, soups etc..). Overall, a lovely casual spot to gather with friends with many offerings. You can also grab a beer or wine with your meal as well."}
{"text":"Very nice, quiet restaurant. 
I've eaten here a few times now and the Thai section is amazing! I had first gotten food from the \"American side\", a sizzling plate with chicken rice and corn. Was very bland and I would never make that mistake again. 
Later in the week I went back for sushi tacos and they are AMAZING. My boyfriend got a Mum bowl, which is your choice of rice or noodles as base, 4 vegetable choices, 1 or 2 proteins and some sprinkled flavours on top. Was a big portion for the price (10.99 for 2 proteins)
I will never stray from their Thai section again

Unagi sushi taco, spicy salmon sushi taco and lobster sushi taco"}
{"text":"A solid 3! This review is solely based on the sushi burritos and resto.

Upon entering the restaurant, we were immediately greeted and was told that there were 3 ordering stations. First station is where you order ready made food, soups, lasagna, and baked goods as I understood and saw. The 2nd one is where the made to order sushi burrito bar is located and the 3rd section is where you order the mum bowl ( rice or noodles with veggies and protien mixed together). It's very busy and a little overwhelming if you take your time to order because you will lose your spot in the line up. 

We obviously went for the sushi burrito. I ordered the eel and my boyfriend ordered the salmon. After we got our order we paid for it then you can grab your seats. The decor of this restaurant is clean, simple and cozy. 

Upon trying our sushi burrito, we noticed that they give you a packet of wasabi and packet of soy sauce, get a bowl to mix them in. It would be better if they had a serve yourself soy sauce bottle and wasabi. Anywhooo we made it work. I liked the salmon better in my opinion due to the chunks of salmon you get and the fillings are better. I enjoyed the eel but I find that I didn't get enough eel in my sushi burrito in comparison to the salmon. So two sushi burritos, 2 water came up to 30 bucks! That's a bit expensive!!!!

I'll return here but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great food! The mum bowl is huge and reasonably priced.  Staff was incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"Cute place you'd probably miss driving down the street. I first came across this restaurant in an insauga article about a new sushi burrito restaurant. They have about 5 different sushi burritos to choose from, plus pokebowls. There's also a bakery/cafe inside the same space as well, and the baked goods are pretty good too! The decor is hip, and it's a pretty big space to chill. Prompt service!"}
{"text":"This place is sort of a pseudo \"fast food\" type experience in a clean, casual, classy space. You walk in, line up, order (there are separate lines for the customized \"mum\" bowls and sushi burrito + poke bowls), then pay, then you seat yourself. Located just west of Dundas and Dixie (in the plaza where the Bluenotes, Shoe Club, and Suzy Shier outlets are), we visited on a Friday evening around 6:30 PM, and it was fairly busy with couples, young families, and various groups. 

We ordered a crispy ginger beef \"mum\" bowl on a bed of basil fried rice with some mixed vegetables on the side, and a smoked salmon poke bowl. For both items, we paid around $24.00.

Our \"mum\" bowl was delicious and a good size. Nice flavour, texture, and we really enjoyed the basil fried rice. Our poke bowl was nice and fresh, very generous with salmon portions, and the ordering process was easy and quick. I wouldn't call it the best, but what we had was put together decently, and it was satisfying.

Overall, we would come here again. It's an easy spot to pick for a group hangout, particularly because of its good amount of seating (they have a number of booths, tables, counters, and some couch space). They also provide free WiFi for customers."}
{"text":"This fast-casual restaurant caught my eye one weekday evening, so I stopped in to see what kind of offerings they had.

Along with a number of instantly ready takeout items, including sandwiches and pastries, Corner boasts a \"Mum Bowl\" station where you pick a protein, four vegetables, a sauce, and extra toppings for a reasonable price.

I went with Chili Chicken and topped that with broccoli, corn, and green beans. I got a curry sauce on the side, and the whole thing was finished off with crushed peanuts and fried onions.

And while there was nothing particularly mind-blowing about the dish, I did enjoy eating it and it did fill me up quite nicely. I especially liked the curry sauce, which was rich, creamy, and flavorful.

Corner is essentially a step above food-court fare, as everything has been preprepared and is essentially sitting around until they run out (ie it's not the freshest meal you'll ever eat)."}
{"text":"Went in for a casual dinner with girl friends. Some of us got the seafood tacos and others for the sushi burritos. We had the spicy salmon and shrimp tacos - both flavourful and the toppings were fresh and plenty. The sushi burrito was average.. the rice and seaweed wrap felt a bit extra - because a bit too much by the end of it. Also a bit pricey for $12+tax for street style food. Good place to try new Asian flavours though! 

Also tried their brunch in Jan 2018 and it was good. The eggs benny with salmon, and the only issue I had was the eggs were a bit over done. Price wise everything is under $12 and offer a decent portion size."}
{"text":"Came here to the try the much hyped about sushi burrito. I tried the rising sun sushi burrito while the gf tried the unagi dance. I liked the rising sun as it was basically a jumbo sized spicy salmon hand roll but the salmon tasted fresh and went well with the avocado and spicy mayo. My gf liked the unagi dance but felt that the portion size of the unagi was a little on the small side. 

While we both enjoyed our choices, we both agreed that for the size and the price point, $10.99 and $12.99 respectively, it was good to try once but we'd rather enjoy smaller hand rolls at an AYCE sushi restaurant. 

Also, would like to mention that the interior of the restaurant was clean and the service was good. May come back to try their bowls and other dishes."}
{"text":"I'm not over the sushi burrito hype. Corner fills them with a ton of extra vegetables that give them a fresh, crisp taste. Had an amazing experience stopping by today!

My group also got the lobster taco and unagi taco as well. The corn was a nice fresh addition, and there was no skimping on the eel or lobster. 

Fries and gravy were okay. (If you're adventurous, put some wasabi in their gravy. SO good.)

Finished it off with a $5 Sapporo. There really are no complaints. 

Great atmosphere and caring staff behind the counter. The name carries that sentiment. :)"}
{"text":"I like the interior of this sleek but casual cafeteria style place. It has plenty of seating for families or friend catch ups and several people seem to do work on their laptops there. The noise level is average.

There are many food options here like sushi burritos, rice bowls, sushi rolls and desserts. I've heard from friends that their sushi burritos are good. I've only tried their terriyaki crispy beef rice bowl here and it was a great portion for $10. This concept of being able to customize the veggies, protein, rice/noodle, sauce and toppings is one that many places do. Corner by Spoon and Fork does a decent job of it and I don't really have any complaints about the taste and freshness of the food that they serve...it's hard not to compare their rice bowls to Basil Box though (still my #1 for rice bowls) for around the same price. I'd be open to coming back to trying their other food options here though!"}
{"text":"When my favorite ayce sushi restaurant in borderline Sauga/Oakville decides to make a burrito... This is the result! A way better sushi burrito compared to the one in dt Toronto. We got the rising sun (salmon) and the spicy flaming dragon. It's good and filling. But to be honest, it's just a giant maki roll. We ordered calamari as well and it tasted like it came from a frozen box at the grocery store. Don't order that. 

Would like to try their poke bowls next time though."}
{"text":"Love this place. The popular sushi burrito is excellent, and pokebowls are even better in my opinion. Half greens and half brown rice is the way to go. Never tried the mum bowl and about to try from the regular menu. The ONLY issue I have with this place is that it seems to take forever if you want a sushi burrito or mum bowl. Even if there is one person in line in front of you, it will be a while until it's your turn. I found this to either be miscommunication from which workers are working which station...or just not enough people working this popular station. 
Other than that though, everything about this place is worth revisiting and perfect before or after the gym which is down the street.
And everything trying their other regular menu, I can confirm that this is also delicious.

My favorite sushi burrito so far is the Rising Sun."}
{"text":"Having tried a couple of the regular Spoon and Fork locations and having enjoyed the food, I wanted to find out what a \"Corner\" is while in the area.
Walking in, my first impression was that the place didn't quite know what exactly it wanted to be, is it a diner or is it Asian food?
A couple of hipsters couldn't decide what they wanted to eat, so I stepped up and ordered in the bowl line (the only one where a staff person was there for customers). I'd like to say please have a list or signs for identification if I'm choosing what to eat from a counter. I'm told I get to choose four veggies but not being able to identify them at close range doesn't help; I picked the four I could identify.
The price was reasonable and the food very tasty although the layout left something to be desired: one could easily walk around in a maze a few times to get one meal. Seating area looked and felt more perfunctory than anything, an escape from the restaurants despite a bit of trying.
I followed someone who looked as though he knew what he was doing with removing my tray from the table I sat down at; no signs here. I think a couple more signs and a bit better organization and this place is an easy 5/5."}
{"text":"Great quick place to get lunch.   The ingredients are fresh and the staff is very nice.   For all the overrated food in Yorkville this is a nice welcome"}
{"text":"Two-words:  Sushi+burrito, a.k.a. \"sushito\".  Review based on this item + takeout ONLY.

I'll give it to my people, they are certainly good with taking an existing idea and jumping on the bandwagon/riding the trend wave.  And that is what Corner by Spoon & Fork has done with the food trend which is basically a large maki roll, not cut up into individual pieces, but eaten like a burrito.

So if you think there are black beans and cheese mixed in with raw fish or some other concoction, windshield wipe that thought out of your mind!

Interior:  VERY NICE considering the somewhat shady, by Mississauga standards, area.  Then again, restaurant opened up a coupla months ago, but I was still surprised though.

Ordering process:  Somewhat confusing as when you walk in, you either feel like sitting down or approaching the cash counter, so that's what I did:  Ordered, paid, then proceeded to select which sushito I wanted.  Afterwards, I was corrected by the sushito maker.

I got the Spicy Flaming Dragon which was $10.99.  Not sure of the ingredients, but I was attracted to the spicy part.  I *believe* they used tuna, but unlike a regular maki roll, they used some baby spinach.  I was afraid that they'd pile on the rice, but they put a thin layer, so I was pleased with that!

Price is more or less in line of what you'd pay at a restaurant for a maki roll, but no need to tip here.  Roll was made quickly.

One thing that I wished they had done was NOT layer the bed of rice on top of the seaweed beforehand.  It wasn't done too much ahead of time, but my seaweed was not crunchy by the time I got home.

Verdict?  Quick, efficient meal which is healthier than a burger+fries!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi burrito! This place has a great casual atmosphere with quality food. Great place to catch up with friends or even for a quick 'grab and go'. I'll definitely come back here if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Long time no review but figured I'd review one of the more memorable joints I've been to recently.

THE SUSHI BURRITOS HERE ARE AMAZING.

Before coming by Corner, I'd been waiting all summer to try a sushi burrito from various places (food trucks, other restaurants...) but none were in Mississauga. Made it worse that I worked an evening shift at the time. Luckily Yelp pulled through and recommended Corner and I was not disappointed at all. 

The sushi burrito is the only dish I tried (two various types) but I feel like their take on the poke bowl would be good too. But the burritos were nice and FAT. DEAR GOD. The amount of rice, fish and veggies were greatly balanced, not one was more than the other. It just felt right! And I was worried that they would cheap out on fish (as some joints do when they cheap out on meats for bento boxes) but I was greatly pleased to find out they didn't.

I'd gone back at least 4 times after my initial visit and discovering this gem, and I was honestly sad when I left Mississauga for a new job in Toronto since I'd be missing these magical burritos. I hope the Yorkville location is just as good!"}
{"text":"Spoon and Fork is a popular sushi chain in west GTA. I was happy to find out that they have a non buffet option.  I love their sushi bowls and sushi burritos, but not so much their sushi tacos. I usually customize my sushi bowl without all that creamy sauce and only ask for the teriyaki-like sauce. Its fresh and healthy. I could probably eat their food all day. The burrito is like a giant vegetable filled sushi roll. Glad that Mississauga has some trendy food place options! They also serve beer!"}
{"text":"We went there specifically for the sushi burrito. I had really high expectations and usually that ends up in disappointment when it comes to food items but here I wasn't disappointed one bit.
We had the rising sun and I was happy that they didn't overdo on the rice serving, everything was of just the right proportion in the burrito.

I would highly recommend going here if you want to have a filling sushi treat at a price of $11.99!

Plus, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Went back again last night to find that they have ahi bowls !!!! Ahhh how exciting ;) ... I tried a salmon build your own ahi bowl ! It was so good, I got it with Edamame, pico de gallo(tomato salsa), carrot, and corn , and brown rice which was heavily seasoned(so delicious). The only reason this is a 4 star and not a five is that I was packed with rice in bowl but not enough meat, not a really bad thing I mean I'll still order it, because the flavours were just so good ! ;) can't wait to try the tuna ahi bowl."}
{"text":"Love the way you can make your own bowl. Very feeling and appetizing.

The feel of the restaurant is like home. It is a great place to have a meal and do some work. I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Food court style. Created your own or choose from their list. Made to order!
Best part? The packaging! I love how they wrapped the sushi burrito. You can easily spilt it in half and eat it mess free! They also put two cute tiny containers inside for soy sauce and wasabi. It was just perfect  
Also tried the poké bowl and sushi tacos. Burrito is still my fav ;)"}
{"text":"Went here today with a friend to get the famous \"sushi burrito\" and it did not disappoint. You can choose from a few suggested burritos or make one custom. They have a large and varied selection of toppings (meats, veggies, sauces, tobiko, etc.) and are very generous when filling the burrito! They gave it to me in this large tube and it was MORE than enough for lunch - and only $12.99.     I got salmon, avocado, mango, cucumber, arugula, cabbage, green onion, tempura bits, and spicy mayo, it was perfect :)"}
{"text":"I came here twice. The first time was for breakfast and we got the atlantic egg benedict and pancake with strawberry/blueberry & whipped cream. Wow what can I say the breakfast tasted really good and fresh plus the portions were huge. The potatoes served with the egg benedict was addicting, so good! 

The second time I came here was for lunch. And we got the salmon sushi burrito, spicy salmon taco and spicy tuna taco. I really like the tacos, they had a great amount of flavour and tasted great. The sushi burrito on the other hand was very bland. I would not get that again. Next time I want to try their poke bowls, they look really good."}
{"text":"Very affordable for the amount of food that you get.  Food is great as well as the sushi. Different variety of food from all day breakfast, to pastas, to sushi, to sandwiches and soups.  Great for indecisive people who don't know what type of food to eat (like me) lol.   I have yet to try the sushi burrito.  The place is well decorated, clean, and spacious.  Friendly staff. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"The craze for sushi burritos is on the rise at the moment, so when I found out that theres a place in Mississauga that serves it I was determined to check the place out.
It's located in an unexpected area, and I think it would do so much better if located somewhere more visible and central. 
I really liked the decor of the place. It was huge with a chilled ambience.
There is no table service, so you will have to go to the counters and order. One counter served all day breakfast, along with pre-made salads and sushi. Another counter had the sushi burrito's (sushirrito), and the final counter had this 'make your own bowl' option, which is just like Basil Box where you choose your carb, protein, vegetables, sauce, and toppings. 
For the sushi burrito you can choose your protein, sauce, and vegetables.
Although I selected this restaurant to try the sushi burrito, the bowl really intrigued me and resulted in me changing my mind. What made this bowl stand out for me was the many more options, especially the rice. you could choose between quinoa, brown rice, coconut rice, and egg fried rice. The proteins were all stir fried, which was a disappointment, since I'm not a fan of greasy stir fried foods. But I opted for the lemongrass chicken. My friend got the vegetarian eggplant with his coconut rice.
The bowl was pretty deceiving, as it looked pretty huge but actually wasn't. Mine was okay, although I did fall in love with the coconut rice. 
One thing I noticed was that majority of the people coming in were all getting the sushi burrito's, since it's a pretty new thing right now.
For the serving size, I found this place pretty pricey. The sushi burrito's were quite expensive too ($12 for one burrito) and I doubt one can fill you up.
I do recommend this place for something different and I'll be sure to return BUT for the sushi burrito."}
{"text":"Nice, cozy dessert place. Open til past midnight so it's perfect hangout place after movies. Typical dessert place and nothing really special there. Decent food and decent service I would say."}
{"text":"Desserts are not made in house but I'm ok with that as it's delicious! They also have a cappuccino/espresso machine which is a plus! Sushi burritos and pokes are decent. And so is breakfast. But got table with the more \"Chinese\" type food is just meh. Atmosphere isn't bad. It's kinda like an Asian resto met Panera Bread."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is inviting, large, not crowded and has comfy seats. The washroom is large, modern, and clean. 

There are a huge variety of food to select from. Apparently you order first, pay, get your number and your food will be brought to you. 

I had to ask for water and in return, the girl at the cashier told me the entrees came with complimentary coffee which you serve yourself. What??? My partner didn't know about it and she offered him a drink/soup combo for an additional $2.50 - which he declined. So I got us coffee and water. If only she was clear from the beginning instead of me walking around. 

The food was mediocre. My chicken penne pasta was not hot at all. So indeed I was disappointed. Few sun-dried tomatoes on top only. The portion was good for a lunch. My partner had tomato sauce pork chop which was hot and it looked good. He enjoyed it. 

Verdict: if I do go back, I'll like to try their brunch menu. No pasta for me at this place.  Overall, I loved the inside atmosphere since it's in an eccentric plaza."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourite go to's. For the price, you get a lot of food, especially if you are getting the protein bowls or the sushi bowl. Great atmosphere as well, as i study here on occasions; yes, they have wifi. Will come back again and again."}
{"text":"You order your food from the counter but the quality of the food is better than any breakfast place. It is served to you from the kitchen. Had pancakes with blueberries, cream and sausages. Every element was good quality; the pancake was made as good as it gets with a slight crunch on the outside and soft as cake inside. Sausages were just fine - crisped outside and slightly gooey and juicy inside. I liked the medium roast coffee. Now with the set up as unique as it is I don't know if and how to tip. Sure you order from counter but you get attentively served when your order is ready."}
{"text":"Sushi burrito, poke bowls, rice and noodle bowls, breakfast, pasta, cakes, and the list goes on and on. My mouth watered as I scanned all the menu offerings; it was so difficult to decide what to get.

First and foremost, it's pretty much like a food court but upscale - you go to the different stations and place your order, then take it to the cash register, pay, and grab a comfy seat.

I decided on the sushi burrito and my colleague suggested the Rising Sun, sub seaweeed in lieu of the lettuce. $11.99+tax for a full sushi burrito (2 giant pieces) was more than filling. I finished only half and saved the other half as an afternoon snack. Ingredients were average, nothing overly exceptional, but for your options in Mississauga, this was pretty good!

As we were leaving, we saw another party order their new sizzling plates - definitely know what I'm ordering next time! 

Overall a pleasant place, would recommend you check it out (maybe more than once too to try everything)!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. During the first time,the eggs Benedict was great, properly cooked with runny eggs. The hash browns were amazing, as they were shaved and delicious. This second trip was disappointing. Eggs were overcooked, the English muffin was barely toasted, and they gave us the wrong hash browns (home fries). One thing I'll never understand about this place, is that they only provide those little ketchup packets and it reminds me of going through a drive thru. Nice atmosphere and presentation. Hopefully this was just an off day for the kitchen."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on a Wednesday. First time there and tried the sushi burrito. Flaming dragon. Had to pay $1 extra for brown rice which is OK but the guy behind the counter was training this other guy and speaking in Cantonese and he must have thought I couldn't understand but he was basically saying skimp on the salmon. For $13 before tax it's pretty expensive. The amount of salmon is probably one ounce. Needless to say I was not impressed! However my friend got the mum bowl which is noodles or rice plus meat and veg of your choice. It looked pretty good and there's way more meat than the burrito. I will give them another chance but seriously don't scam the customers and be stingy with the ingredients. Nice atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Just started going here last week. Been here a few times after that. Loved it! Food is good and reasonably priced. Today I found out that they made some changes.... Such as: 3 veggies in mum bowls instead of 4 and no sauce (not sure if the sauce is coming back). Sorta disappointing! I hope they go back to how it was."}
{"text":"Normally I have a really good experience here but the last time I went was disappointing service wise. I still gave 4 stars because the food is great and most of the staff is nice but the one particular employee I had the other night gave a bad experience. To start, I had asked for their premade salmon poke bowl which I would still reccommend, but he kept asking me what vegetables I wanted in my bowl. When I explained for the 3rd time that I wanted the premade bowl, he seemed to understand but then continued to ask me a bit later. After this I explained I didn't want a build your own bowl, and then he again seemed to understand and the rest went smoothly. I arrive at the cash to find that he had wanted to charge me for a build a bowl. The cashier was kind and when I explained the situation just charged me for a regular bowl but it was frustrating that the person making my food kept trying to overcharge me."}
{"text":"After seeing insauga' post on Facebook we decided to try the sushi burrito for lunch. It's in an old plaza but the inside is clean and modern. Besides offering sushi burritos, they also offer breakfast items, sandwiches, mum bowls, take-out sushi, and dessert. 

I expected sushi burrito displays with the names but they weren't there. I asked the staff but their English wasn't the best. So I just played it safe and just got an unagi roll. The unagi roll didn't have much unagi which was a bit disappointing since the burritos aren't cheap. My sushi burrito was mostly filled with vegetables. My boyfriend ordered the sunrise sushi burrito which had plenty of salmon. He was able to finish the entire thing where as I only could finish a bit more than 1.5. 

In total, just for 2 sushi burritos it came out to $29 and change. I wasn't expecting to spend that much for lunch. It was a different experience but I won't have it often."}
