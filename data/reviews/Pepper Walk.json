{"text":"The food is quite poor in terms of taste and presentation. Service is also mediocre. We've tried it on two separate occasions and the experience was not really worth it. In a city where there are so many halal food options, I'd choose to go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Finally a halal steak house that knows how to cook a filet mignon at Medium! I really enjoyed this new restaurant located in heartland. They used fresh ingredients and seasonal vegetables. I enjoyed their desserts and milkshakes were made fresh with real fruit. I appreciated the fact that I ordered chicken bites for my son thinking that they'd bring out frozen nuggets, but they didn't. They made their own in house nuggets with chicken breast.  A clean, modern restaurant with great service. Prices are reasonable for the quality of food."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. I did not expect a halal establishment to come through with amazing steaks and bbq food. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because they were understaffed so things took slightly longer but still no complaints. The server was fantastic. The food, well let me tell you about the food.   Their Jalapeno poppers are one of the best I have eaten. I ordered the 12oz AAA NY strip(medium) was slightly close to medium well but still good and I topped it with their shrimp add-on. Amazing combo. The quality is top notch and comparable to most high priced fine dining restaurants. The pricing is also very fair.   My wife ordered the chicken clubhouse sandwich and damn it was good. Definitely going to be a regular patron there. We need more halal establishments like these.  The restaurant was clean and well kept and the decor was modern and contemporary.   I highly recommend you try it if you have any doubts. I was going to read reviews and then try it but my wife suggested we go in blind and just give it a shot.   Hats off to the owner and I'll see you guys again very soon."}
{"text":"Looks like they have made changes to their menu as all negative related to certain dishes are no longer on the menu.  Went with my wife for early dinner so the place was empty. We got the calamari, tikka boti and garlic shrimp ravioli. We got the kids penne ala rosa from kids menu. Everything was really good. The servers came by often to make sure everything was OK and topped up the drinks.   Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Stopped by again! Service and food was excellent! No complaints whatsoever. Any of the burgers will do :) The jalapeno poppers were quite good too."}
{"text":"Great tasting food and presentation. The owner was also very involved in making sure we were satisfied with our meal, which was a nice gesture."}
{"text":"First time dining at Pepperwalk and  our visit started with terrible service.    The person waiting on our table didn't know the menu well, they could not make any recommendations and simply stated \"I don't know\" to inquiries rather than \"let me find out for you\".  Next, this is a dine-in restaurant, a hoody is inappropriate attire and if the restaurant wants to charge high prices for their food items, the quality should match the price.    The double cheese burger was mediocre for $17 and the chicken parmesan sandwich at $17.50 was bland.  I ordered the chicken parmesan.  Instead of a bun or baguette, regular white bread was used.  Most concerning is the fact that the chicken was undercooked, a good portion of the chicken  was raw, for that reason I could not finish my sandwich.  It went to waste and I left there hungry.  Although the manager apologized, I still had to pay for the food, I was not offered a replacement.  I did receive a mere 15% reduction in price (even though only half the sandwich was consumd) which amounted to$2 and something sense.   Absolutely terrible.  I highly regret not snapping  a picture of the meat as verification.  Undercooked/raw meat can cause food poisoning .  The only thing decent from the foods tried by our group was the grilled portobello chicken supreme.  Would I recommend this place?  ABSOLUTELY NOT."}
{"text":"I love their food and environment all the time I go there . Food quality is excellent . There one manager talks little extra lol but I rate this place 5 star . Excellent place for halal food . Thumbs up for desserts too . My fav is Caramel Pecan Brownie"}
{"text":"Went here with the family, ordered a steak, crispy onion burger, the salmon, and the balouchi half chicken. Everything was done exceptionally, and the service was friendly. They also offered us an appetizer for free while we waited for our food (crispy chips with hummus). Overall, was pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Weve been here twice. The first time was during their soft opening phase and the 2nd one just last week. There's been a huge change in their portion size. The serving size has basically cut in half. We ordered their Double Cheese Crispy Burger and the Balouchi Chicken. The burger was over cooked and under seasoned. The balouchi chicken was initially served as a whole chicken now its half chicken at the same price. The worst thing was we ordered orange juice for the kids and were given a box of minute maid and we were charged $3 for that!! The service was good (3starts) but the food is definitely over priced. We probably wont visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent Place .  Awesome Service. Finger licking good food. What else can i expect. And yes new Lunch Menu options for 9.99"}
{"text":"It was on my list for a while but didn't get a chance till last week. Nice ambience good food service wasn't too bad. Value for money was ok but overall a good experience me and my family enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Great service here .. the owners are so nice and accommodating. Food was really good and we enjoyed our dine here .. will revisit again ."}
{"text":"We went for dinner with family. The service was great, the food was excellent and the atmosphere was very nice. I felt the price was little bit on higher side."}
{"text":"Been there multiple times with multiple people. Good food overall not wow but not bad. Service could be improved."}
{"text":"It's only been opened for 2 months when we came here to test it. We were the only ones in there and its a pretty big room so it felt awkward cause there were more servers and hosts and cooks than customers. Me and hubby. It was a Friday night at 6:30 pm.  They sat us by the cooking area which gave us no privacy. The lights were not dimmed so it was a bit uncomfortable while they try to look busy as we ate.   Now the food. It was actually delicious! Started with calamari which had good batter and sauce. Hubby had their burger and i had their chicken tikka boti. Then finished with lava cake which was soo yummy!   Would go back once they get settled and set their ambiance better for sure."}
{"text":"~3.5 stars~  Couple of us went to try this place and the restaurant was quite big and had a nice seating area. The server was friendly and the food came in a decent time frame.  We started with Chimichurri Cheesy Garlic Bread and Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers as appetizers. The bread was really good but we didn't like the Poppers as they were made with the red pepper and were not spicy as we anticipated.  For the main I ordered Chicken Parmesan Club Sandwich. It was a very good sized sandwich with crusted chicken breast and Smoked beef bacon with Chipotle ranch dressing, caramelized onion and sautéed mushroom. The combination was great and I enjoyed every bit of the sandwich.   The desert was on the house and the manager came to apologize after my friend complained that couple of ingredient were missing as mention on the menu. Apparently, they were out and didn't tell us. So we got to try Caramel Pecan Brownie, which was decent.  For my Muslim bro and sis - They serve halal food at this location"}
{"text":"I was surprised to find a nice, clean steakhouse that actually knows their meats. There were six people in our group ordering so we tried all the different cuts of steaks and each one was cooked exactly how we asked (medium and medium well). I would suggest you go off peak, avoiding weekends especially, so they are able to ensure your meal is perfect. By the time we ordered, it got busy so it was hard to get waitstaff's attention. But, all in all the food was fresh, tasty and our server did her best to ensure we were happy with our time there."}
{"text":"This is a new halal restaurant in our area.  Very clean Not enough servers for the amount of people that were there. I had the portobello mushroom chicken and it was delicious.  Smaller portions but very good presentation and flavour.  There is no kids menu. So my kids had cheese quesadilla and that was average. Just cheese on tortilla.  Would go back for sure to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in 6 months. The food is usually average to good depending on the dish. However, each time I came in, the prices have gone up each time. When I mentioned this to the manager he accepted and understood why I walked out.   I understand a price adjustment, but it should not happen this frequently and this significantly. Prices have gone up by 25% each time!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite halal Steakhouse in GTA. Excellent ambience and service. Went with a large group of about 20 people and everyone enjoyed the food. Staff was very courteous. People who complain about small portions surprises me. I have been to many fine restaurants in the world and what you pay is not always the price of the food. You have to consider other things too. Overall I would highly recommend this place and would go again!"}
{"text":"The grilled portobello chicken breast has an outstanding creamy sauce, so did the bow tie ala rosa... amazing!! The burgers in general are great too!! That's what my partner always have. And their staff is so friendly, they even paid attention to the kids and were talking to them and asking them if they liked the food.. which they did."}
{"text":"We got the smokey ribs, portobello chicken and tenderloin. Their meat is so tender and juicy. The masala fries are delicious. The place is very clean, spacious and quiet."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place. First off, all their food is hallal which is a definite plus. Every dish we got was absolutely delicious! The steak was smooth to cut through and so juicy. The appetizers they gave was a bonus, it was hummus and breadstricks. The restaurant has a beautiful sleek and classy vibe to it. The staff was ridiculously nice and welcoming. It's definitely a place you want to dress up to. We were there for a surprise party and they were really helpful in helping us coordinate it.  Their menu ranged from sandwiches, to pasta, to steaks. They sadly had maybe 3 veggie options. I eyed some that maybe could be customizable.  The prices are a bit high, but I would say fair. Most dishes were about 20$+"}
{"text":"Good steaks and BBQ, but lacks consistency. Quantity for the price is less. Been there twice but could have been usual if they improve quantities and maintain consistency."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Pepper Walk.  From the moment we walked in the service was excellent and the staff were very nice ! The food was exceptional and delicious.  If you are in the area and need to grab a quick bite , Pepper walk is the place to go ! I will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this place 5 or 6 times now, and I think it has progressively gotten better each time. Their parmesan chicken club sandwich is my favorite so far. Service used to be a bit slow when it first opened, but is quick and accurate now. Overall a good local grill with an East meets West fusion!"}
{"text":"This is my first review so I'll try to be kind...went with a group of 8 for my birthday...Place was really busy so that was a good sign...service didn't go so well. We did have have to wait a very long time for the food and had to talk to the manager twice...who by the way did come to our table afterwards to apologize as well as the waiter who offered to pay for dessert, which in my eye did show ownership of the issue. All our food was served except mine...and had to be asked what my order was...:(  Food was good but it could also be the fact that I was hungry after waiting.    I do love the fact that they have a variety of items however this could be the reason for delays in service. Simplicity in the menu might be food for thought.  Restaurant decor was nice and clean. I do however think they should get rid of there ordering system which is by tablet since I believe that also caused some delays with the server taking our order and my food. Also when someone orders water please I would hope in the future they ask bottled or from tap since some people have preferences and don't prefer and over charge on there bill.  All in all I would give the night a 3 star. I would go back and give them a second chance on there service only because of the food quality.  I hope my first review will help them improve and stay tuned for the next great review...)"}
{"text":"Came in and it was empty. Should have been a sign to leave but wanted to give it a chance. Saw the menu and the mains seemed more expensive for the type of feel you get from the restaurant (menu is on a piece of paper). Ordered chicken breast portabello and lamb chops. On the menu it says you have choices of sides but the waiter didn't ask us what we wanted. The food came out and we both got frozen bagged vegetables and garlic mash potatoes (I doubt that's fresh too). For $27 dishes I would think they would make the sides fresh. Lamb chops was pure fat. Wasn't a great experience since I could have made a chicken breast myself and dump a can of mushroom soup on it. I will never return. Monetary loss:$70"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. Went with my wife and we loved it. We were greeted by Arun, and he provided us with exceptional service throughout the evening. He made sure we were taken care of during our meal. As for the food; probably the best halal steak and poutine I have had in the city so far. Would definitely return and recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous experience tonight.  I was the first to review this restaurant 5 months ago, shortly after they opened. Overall, I enjoyed the experience and decided to return tonight.  We called during the day today to book a table for 5 for tonight (Saturday). The group was fasting for Ramadan and we open our fast at 9pm. We were told to come at 8:15pm.   2 of us showed up on time and there was no record of our reservation. We were seated anyway at the corner of the restaurant and placed the order for the whole group around 8:30pm - 2 pops, 1 appetizer and 4 mains - and said we wanted the food at 9pm.  Before the fast broke at 9:04pm, we were given a couple plates with dates (nice touch, it's customary to open the fast with dates) along with the 2 pops and water. Everything went downhill after this.  We received the appetizer at 9:15pm. I asked for an ETA for the mains - server said she'd go and check - she never came back to give an update.  We asked for another pop - did not receive it.   One of the pops received was flat so my friend asked for another and for an update on the food. The waiter took the drink, and never came back to give the drink nor give an update. The friend had to ask again.   We received our mains at 9:53pm...1 hour and 23 minutes after ordering. I get it - it's Ramadan and most customers at the restaurant at this time are probably fasting so we all want our food at exactly 9pm. It must be tough to manage, especially on the weekend when it's busier. A bit of a delay is understandable. However, it makes zero sense for the food to have taken THIS long, especially when we were one of the first groups there (it got busy after we ordered).   One person in my group had asked for cheese on one of the burgers - did not receive it.  Another had asked for chipotle mayo on the side - did not receive it. She asked again and got it.  The food was actually good (as it had been at my first visit), if you ignore that 3/4 mains were room temperature. We waited 1 hour and 23 minutes for room temperature food?  The main server apologized for the delays, but no comps or discounts were given.  Giving 2 stars as an average of my two experiences."}
{"text":"It failed to impress me. We order 3 burgers and they all were burnt. The staff was nice enough to make me a new one, but how can you burn a burger? On top the burger was extremely salty. I couldnt even eat half of it. Club sandwich was good. Price is too high. I wouldn't go here again for this price."}
{"text":"No Menu prices listed on their website, no menu copy posted at the restaurant entrance and no liquor service (not licensed). Menu printed on a legal size paper similar to a Diner menu. Menu items are way overpriced for services rendered. Service was not attentive to details as server did not provide napkin and cutlery to all guests on our table, poured water was at room temperature and glass was not refilled thereafter. Food quality was good but presentation was poor for my butter chicken order priced at $19.50. Bill was placed on the table without any plate or folder. Needs improvement for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Good ambience and quality food. Portions however were small and pricy. Staff was knowledgeable and quick.   Menu has a mix of South-Asian and western. There well-done New York steak was fully cooked and delectable. Food prep was outstanding and perfect for your trail of social media following (You welcome)"}
{"text":"We went there yesterday for Iftar - we were a group of 12 adults.  When we arrived, they had seedless dates on the table, which was nice. After breaking our fast, we all prayed in a designated prayer space they had created for Maghreb.  We ordered pretty much everything on the Appetizer list and topping our list were Jalapeño poppers and Nachos. The Jalapeño poppers were greater in quantity and better in taste then Affy's in Mississauga. The nachos are the best I've had in a long time.    Dining experience was wonderful. From the halal options in GTA, this restaurant is more \"upper-end\" and it's hard to find a fine dining halal place where we can treat some guests and not have to be surrounded with alcohol.  Most of us ordered the burgers for our main course - my Angus Burger was very juicy, sizeable and the side of fries made it a perfect meal. I actually wasn't able to finish all of it, so got the rest packed before I left.  Service was top notch - the servers were polite, kept checking up on us, did drink re-fills and were able to split the bill equally among our guests which made it easy and quick for all of us to pay.  Overall, it's in a great central location (heartland), excellent food and outstanding service - i will definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the gf right when it opened on a Sunday. Safe to say we were the first ones to dine in and were promptly greeted by the server. I had ordered the crispy onion burger with fries and my gf ordered a chicken tikka wrap with sweet potato fries. We also ordered the spicy fried calamari to start. The calamari was good and the serving size was decent. My burger was nice and juicy but nothing special. My gf found the wrap to be good overall but nothing to write home about either. For some reason, it took quite a bit of time to get the check even though there was only one other party seated at the time."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today- lunch on a Saturday at 2pm. The restaurant was empty, three tables occupied including mine. Extremely slow service. Large, open space, suitable for parties. My southwest chicken club sandwich was alright, 3/5. It was quite expensive for the two sandwiches. My friends all ordered the New York steak which they were pretty satisfied with. Not a bad restaurant, besides the fact that it's on the pricier side, and has slow service."}
{"text":"A very nice surprise to visit a Halal BBQ steakhouse with a good atmosphere. Great to celebrate any occasion.   Upon arrival we were greeted and seated at the table we had reserved. The family and I noticed the restaurant was uncomfortably cold inside. The heat was obviously turned down and we brought up this concern to the waiter in which he proceeded to say that he didn't feel it was cold. We just decided to continue with our experience at the restaurant but very uncomfortably.  I ordered the chicken parmesan club sandwich with the cesar salad and overall it was quite tasty except I would have changed the white bread used for the buns to maybe a ciabatta bun. The rest of the family ordered the double cheese crispy onion burger, grilled chicken with cesar salad and poutine, chicken tikka boti and chicken reshmi tikka both served with biryani rice and salad. My family found the poutine to be salty along with the chicken tikka botis and chicken reshmi tikka. The rice served with both the tikkas tasted old and bland. We voiced our dislikes of the foods and the manager/owner personally came to speak to us. He was very kind and listened to all of our issues. He told us he would let the chef know going forward and that he would knock off the two meals from our bill. Service provided by him was excellent and would definitely return to try again the dishes he said he would make changes to. If these changes were made to the menu items and seekh kabobs were offered for dinner time a 4 star is definitely warranted."}
{"text":"We went to Pepper Walk Steak House for my husband's birthday dinner. It was past 9 PM on a Friday night. I called ahead, and they said the restaurant is open till 11 PM and the kitchen closes at 10:30 PM. We got there a little while before 10 PM, and were greeted in a friendly manner (by two people!), and seated immediately. We were impressed by what a large space this is, and my husband felt the decor/ambience was nice. It wasn't very busy, but there were maybe 5-6 other active tables.    We ordered two steak dinners with sauce on the side, a shrimp topper for my steak and a mocktail. The total was about $60 before tip, which is around exactly what I'd expect to pay for a halal steak dinner at a restaurant like this (think Affy's, Kara Mia, Crave, etc. About $18-$22 for 8 oz. steaks and $4-$5 mocktails).    Pros:  - Great service. When we walked in, we were greeted by two people in a friendly manner. We were seated immediately. We had multiple waitstaff come to check on us throughout dinner -- visited probably 7 times throughout. We weren't made to feel rushed or anything, despite the kitchen and the restaurant closing soon.  - The food came out very fast.  - The plating was nice! Presentation is everything.   - The crispy fries and the poutine were excellent. Wish I'd had more of these. - The shrimp topper for my steak tasted good.   Cons:  - Steak itself didn't taste great -- it was way too dry and well-done, even though we requested medium and medium rare. They serve it with herb infused butter which it did need. It also needed sauce, but the chimichurri sauce did not taste great either. It didn't taste fresh with natural ingredients, tasted like it came out of a bottle from the grocery store. Maybe we should've gotten the peppercorn demi glace or the... bourbon mushroom demi glace? (Wait, they have a bourbon demi glace on the menu? I thought this place is halal.)  - All the steak sauces were an extra $2 on the side. Why? Just include it with two sides as part of the steak dinner.  - The saffron biryani rice did not go with the steak at all. I get that it's a fusion restaurant, but this should not be an option as a side for steak.  - The mashed potatoes were also not good at all.  - The $5 shrimp topper for my steak was 3 shrimp. I feel this should've been more value for the money.  I'm writing out these cons because the sense I got was that this is a fairly new restaurant and the owners are looking for feedback!  Always happy to have another halal restaurant in the GTA, and the large amount of space make me think this could be a good place to have a celebratory night out with family/friends -- however, I don't think I will be getting the steak again."}
{"text":"My favorite steakhouse in the area was closed for renovation ! I was obliged to look for an alternative and i found Pepperwalk ! That place is just woaw ! Very nice dining area, very good food ! Good portions and gorgeous presentation ! Decent price ! I recommend, i loved and i will return !"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant that just opened up in heartland so my friend and I figured why not give it a try. We were greeted by a lady who gave us our table. The place was really nice, can tell it was newly renovated. It was pretty empty, only one other family eating, but we did go on a Wednesday for lunch so that was understandable. Also being a new restaurant I'm sure the traffic will pick up.   I ordered the crispy onion and cheese burger. Just a note the website shows different menus for lunch and dinner, but I was able to order from the dinner menu during lunch. My friend ordered the steak sandwich. We both loved our meals and were extremely satisfied. It was also very reasonable at around 14 dollars per meal. The burger was thick and juicy and the crispy onions complimented it very well. My friend said the steak sandwich was also really good so I'll have to try that next time. They also have a variety of Indian dishes and maybe we'll try that out in the future.   Only a couple issues we had. It took a while for our food to arrive. We waited around 30-35 minutes which is longer than usual. As the previous review said we can cut them some slack since they just started out. The service was also a little bit awkward. After the lady greeted us and we got our table, she told us to come up to the front to order our meals. When we went to the front a fellow who appeared to be the chef came out to take our order and then asked us where we wanted to sit. We mentioned that we had already been seated. Also when it was time to pay both the lady and the chef came out as we used the machine. It was a little awkward but you can tell they are very new at this and are still learning. They were very nice and friendly and overall we had a great experience, definitely will be headed back soon to try other items."}
{"text":"Excellent tasting gourmet food. I came here on a weekday at 6 p.m. That place was dead.   We ordered a beet salad and it was enough to serve three. Good thing we shared it anyways. We ordered Tikka Kabab. It was seasoned perfectly, not very spicy at all. The tomato chutney condiment was also very tasty.   The menu is vast. The price is a little more than average ($50 for two people for just a  shared appetizer and 2  dinner kabob dinners. No drinks, no desserts)  I would totally eat here again."}
{"text":"Just had a family dinner this evening, the food, the ambiance and the service was awesome!! I highly recommend, and definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"First time here, we brought some friends from out of town. Overall exceed expectations! Loved the atmosphere. Delicious food. Delightful dessert. We are looking to go back and hope that our experience is consistent. Definitely a must try! And great addition to the mississauga halal restaurants!"}
{"text":"At  Pepperwalk I with group of 8 went for the Iftar buffet. There were four main selection for the buffet to choose from. Mushroom Boneless Chicken, Spicy Chicken, Plain Rice and Pasta. Salad selection included Lettuce and spicy Chick Peas. Appitizers included  Nachos and finally for deserts Gulabjaman which is a common Pakistani/Indian sweet.Importantly, they did give out steaks.   While sitting at the tables they were nicely cleaned and proper utensils were provided. Pepperwalk was heavenly understaffed. It was difficult to get the staff to come to our table.  There was just one person that was visible in my books he was just running around trying to meet everyone orders before the Iftar started. Wherefore, we were unable to get what we wanted before hand. (Management needs to hire more staff on busy occasions.)  Moving along to the Salad the lettuce was some what fine in texture. Spicy Check Peas were normal in taste. (Nothing special).  As for the mains the Mushroom Boneless Chicken was quite decent.  It was plus warm. In comparison to the Spicy Chicken, Plain Rice and Pasta which were cold. (They should have not been cold as the food should have been hot for Iftar time). Plus they ran out of the Mushroom Chicken as it was the only decent thing to eat. (Pepper No Meat Grill)  Moving to the Steak it was was difficult to cut as it was dry. Importantly, talking about utensils. The spoon that was given to me was sharper than the  knife. (XD)The steak was a unbreakable meat. No tenderness or flavour I got from it.(Pepperneedsawalk) As it is a steakhouse the steak should have been genuinely nice. (If nothing else was).   Last to point of the sweet and nachos were general plain what could be bought from the market. So they were fine.   Overall, would not likely be returning to this walk for some steak and buffet. So should you unless you would like to gain the same experience of disappointment."}
{"text":"The decor is very impressive and the restaurant is clean (well it is brand new).  There was 4 of us and we ordered the chili fries, which was just minced meat on the nachos, the mutton dish was cold and tasted too tomato-y, the boti chicken was decent as was the philly sandwich.  There was one server, clearly not enough for the number of people in the restaurant however you could see 5 people in kitchen.  our drink order took forever as well.  We decided not to say anything, it's a new restaurant so we wanted to cut them some slack. But then one of us went to the bathroom and there was no towel paper, well that the last straw.  We shared our feedback with the head cook, who just said thanks. Um hello, I was expecting a bit more considering we dropped more then$100 & they should be trying to get people to return but that didn't seem like their priority that day.  We wouldn't return"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Horrible Food. Don't Go Here.  We were with friends last night for a bday party. I ordered medium rare and they gave me a steak that was well done and the fat had not been seared. On informing the owner, all he had to say was thanks for letting us know. Didn't even offer to correct the steak and send it back. HORRIBLE FOOD. Save yourselves some time and money and do not go here. Doesn't even deserve a single star."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch the other day with family. Had a good experience. We were greeted by pleasant hostess. The order came out pretty quick The food tasted good. Very decent food. They have a good variety. You can have quite a few different types of cuisines there.  They were all pleasant. The owner came to check on us to ensure that everything was up to our liking. Even gave complimentary ice cream to the kids. Overall a good experience."}
