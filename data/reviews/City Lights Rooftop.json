{"text":"$$$$ drinks but awesome view. Just not worth the money. Ok, what's with the bouncers. They seem like off duty cops just waiting to slam someone. OMFG! Relax guys..kinda making it uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing! The food is tasty although the prices are extreme. The service leaves much to be desired. There was only one waitress/waiter on the floor on a Friday evening and there were two parties plus other patrons. We brought to the attention of management that we had not been greeted for about 15 mins after taking a seat and it wasn't until then that our order was taken and we never saw a sever again after food was delivered. You must do better."}
{"text":"Super slow drink service, no itemized receipt, expensive watered down drinks, expensive parking, and slow elevator (only one)"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying this venue has great potential for the after work, young professional, and mature folk. Great service, from certain service staff. Colton however, not so much. As a bartender of a 5 star restaurant and bar. I know what last call means. He does not and should be trained otherwise. Last call means you have 30 MINUTES TO ORDER A DRINK. His customer service was horrible and should not be allowed in a hotel bar. Period. The others behind the bar were great and helpful. Scott, was great helped us when Colton refused service because of \"last call\""}
{"text":"Nice view! Drinks and food both are tasty but the drinks are WAY over priced and the food takes a while to get to you. But if you do go try the king of pops drink! Yummy! Just a quick tip to the owners/management.... take the time to train your staff and please give them better uniforms! Something a little less insane asylum looking!"}
{"text":"Awesome view, nice outdoor seating area, drinks were overpriced. The service was fine for me, but I believe the other complaints - everyone seemed a bit new."}
{"text":"My sister and her husband took me to City Lights on my 21st bday for my first drink on a Saturday night.

THE DRINKS: AMAZING. Ok I might not be the best judge, because it was my first drink but I had a glass of Brut and a strawberry lemonade King Pop. Is there anything better on a summer night? I think not.

THE SPACE: Gorgeous. CLT has a breathtaking skyline. The bar is under a small glass cover that leads to the outdoor seating/standing area. It's a bit small but there are plenty of nice seats all with good views.

THE EXPERIENCE: We got there early, around 8 and paid for parking. (The worst part of being located Uptown). We got nice seats and enjoyed our drinks while watching the sunset. As soon as the sun fell, holy granola bears things changed. It went from a place to chat with coworkers to a full out real housewives club. It was PACKED, loud and like what you see on TV. If you like drunk guys hitting on you (a give-in), loud EDM music and being packed like a sardine on top of a building then this is for you. The line to get in bled into the lobby of the hotel downstairs. There is not clear markings advertising the club either, and for good reason, it's beyond crowded. Until the hype dies down, I wouldn't brave the crowd again."}
{"text":"I'm new to Charlotte and I've heard great things about city lights! What an amazing experience! I was greeted by the manager Josh in the elevator! He recommended the Rum Punch! Oh man its delicious. After, I got my usual drink (Grey Goose dirty martini with extra olives), Jack made it perfect for me! The view is absolutely spectacular and the vibe is perfect! Can't wait till summer time! This will be my favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Drinks are expensive-- I think $9 for a beer and around $14 for a cocktail but the atmosphere is great.  Very trendy and awesome view!"}
{"text":"Maybe I would have liked this place better if I was 10 years older, miserably single and a frequent partier. The hotel it is located in is gorgeous, but theres barely any signage to help you find the bar. We got there early so we didnt experience the absolutely ridiculous wait. The rooftop is beautiful and the drinks were good. but if I'm going to pay $15 for a glass of wine with a Popsicle in it again, it wont be here.
Maybe I'm the odd one out, but the scene here is the last place I want to be.
All the men look the same and radiate the \"I was a frat guy in college and still act like im 20, work at a bank, am 35 and single and am way too sunburt\" vibe,
and its full of the epitome of what you would call 'basic' women. 

I'm 23, married, and have no time or patience for the type of people I encountered here.
Forget anytype of romantic rooftop vibe you have in mind. this is a straight up club atmosphere. this is NOT a place to come with your husband/boyfriend and probably not a place to go at all unless youre looking to go home with a stranger who is maybe a 3-4 on a scale of 1-10"}
{"text":"Could be an amazing place! I feel the potential! It definitely has the view going for it!!! 

The view, my company, and the beverages were by far the best parts about the place. 

I really like going into a place to instantly feel comfortable and enjoy the ambiance.  This place didn't do it for me! The cushions were miss matched and fading with the sun. The flower boxes were falling apart and had trash in them. The music seamed to be too loud for casually sitting out in the day light. Although, it may have been serving a purpose to muffle the sounds of the HVAC on rooftop. It seamed like they created a cheep fix for covering it up, with a tall fence covered by some tacky green fake fabric grass that was threaded through. I will spare you the other details.


..Onto the food and drink..

Fair warning, they have an ultra limited food selection.

French Fries- decent, I asked for nothing on them. Tiny side box for $10. I was surprised when the bar tender brought up a to go bag which contained a small box of fries with a side of ketchup. I also asked for ranch on the side too. Which was also, only ok. 

Hendrick gin a tonic- Excellent!!



I can't recommend this place all together, but for sure and with enthusiasm I would recommend Fahrenheit!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but absolutely terrible drinks. Popsicle in champagne was great but I also had a Bellini and lavender Cosmo I believe and both were undrinkable. Hoping it was just the bartender of the night. They also bring your food out in paper bags which is embarrassing. Took some clients there and terrible drinks with food in bags didn't go over well. Live music and rooftop vibe is great. Would go with friends but it's always too crowded. Hoping they have got it figured out by now :)"}
{"text":"To start, the view is beautiful and the King of pops with prosecco is delicious. However, the service is terrible. Our waitress brought us our first glass of wine that was 1/2 full and we still got charged full price. Then we ordered appetizers and one was forgotten about. Instead of bringing it out later or comping a different appetizer for us she just apologized and took an hour to bring out our entrees. All in all this place could be really cool, but the service and half poured glasses of wine for $12-$14 really turned me off. I will probably not go back."}
{"text":"The view is absolutely amazing! Especially when the sun goes down! Perfect breeze and a relaxing setting on a Sunday evening! We ordered a glass of wine that came with the popsicle inside! A bit pricy but worth the experience. I hear it gets a little crazy on Friday nights with a DJ and dance floor. I enjoyed the mellow Sunday evening."}
{"text":"DRINK and ROOFTOP:
The Prosecco and blackberry popsicle drink was excellent with its minty notes! Monday nights seem to have an older crowd, so it's much quieter. The view is phenomenal of downtown and the seating area is covered with lights, colorful seating, and canopies. This is a great place for date night--not too loud and not too quiet with two seat couches and secluded areas to get cozy with your date :)"}
{"text":"Great view. Lots of seating. Bar service sucks. No drink menu. Bartender offers no ideas. Guy at the door says the peeps in front of us were \"professionals\". Whatever that means. Proceeds to rudely card us."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and I aren't \"follow-the-trend\" people in some aspects. we march to the beat of our own drum and don't like things that are played.

...and then we found ourselves at City Lights.

now, we also found ourselves here at 4:00 p.m. on a Saturday, before what I can imagine is before the craziness of the 11:00 p.m. hour is (okay I am not old, but I do not leave the house at 10:30 p.m. anymore to 'go out' okay, fine, I'm usually home by that time, I'm tired...okay!?)

Great view of the city. We had almost the entire roof to ourselves which is the only way I'd have it. Pleasantly surprised, and thrilled that my sparkling wine was served in an actual glass flute and not plastic. J's margarita was very sweet, but hey, that's what you get when it's turn and burn as quickly as possible. You're not here for craft cocktails. You're here to sit on a roof.

They're known for those popsicle drinks, but, we didn't go for the typical play route. Go figure."}
{"text":"Wow guys. I am so disappointed. The food of this \"upper scale\" place is probably the worst menu in Charlotte. Kids meal oriented. Muzzarella sticks and french fries. And that's if you are lucky to order before 11pm. The drinks are super expensive. But the view is amazing."}
{"text":"First of all this place is great and the bartenders mike and Robert are amazing. The coolest guys in Charlotte they will make you feel that you are at your own local bar at home. If you are in Charlotte for one night only you need to come up here and let these guys take care of you."}
{"text":"City Lights benefits from the fact that there aren't too many bars around, as the Sheraton/Le Meridien are slightly outside of Uptown. It's worth going up to City Lights at least once, because you probably won't get as good of a view anywhere else in Charlotte!

The good: The view is the main attractor, but there are some other nice aspects. It's mostly outside, and there's a good amount of space, tables and couches. When we went there was some function happening, but we didn't feel like we were fighting for space. As far as drinks go, the only one I'd recommend is the Popsicle + Champagne (plus some other alcohols you can pair with). The popsicle adds a great flavor to the champagne, and who doesn't like popsicles! 

The bad: The drinks are way overpriced for what they are. They are advertised as \"craft cocktails\" but do not taste like craft cocktails. In addition the service is SO SLOW. You better enjoy the city view, because you'll be waiting for a while."}
{"text":"The view is perfect. I mean picture perfect; which is probably why the cost for food and drink is so expensive. There is nothing too unique about the selection except the King of Pops + champagne drinks. The service is okay; it took a while to find a server to come take our order. The other option was waiting in a long line. This is a great place to get together with friends before a night out or after dinner. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, always bringing out of town guest for the fabulous view or from time to time for a date night. I've never really been blown away by the place. Yesterday kind of ruined the whole place for me!! 

I'll start by says it's very pricey!! Drinks are way to expensive. They are known for the \"Pop and Sparkle\" which is a King of Pops in champagne and it's $14 plus tip EACH! All the other drinks also run quite high. The food is the same because they charge $10 for a small order of parm fries. They only offer a few food items and they are all over priced. (See Menu Photos) 

Yesterday we arrived and we were greeted at the door, once we got off the elevator which was a nice friendly touch but that was the only thing good. Both my fiancé and I got a popsicle drink from the bar and went to sit down. We were approached by many people, I guess they were cocktail servers. Once we were ready for another drink we stopped one of them, Savannah was her name I believe, and tried to order but she told us that we needed to order from Anna. We waited and I saw a woman walk by and the table next to us said \"oh there's Anna\" and ordered from her so we grabbed her to order too. There was a bit of a language barrier but we pointed to what we wanted on the menu \"Rosè and Malbec\" and she said ok. When she returned we asked to close out but when she brought us the check it was the wrong amount. I told her and she walked away to fix it but then a bartender Colton came up to us. He said you are drinking what is on this check and I explained neither of the names matched with what we ordered and one glass cost $4 more than what I ordered so I wanted it to be fixed. He was very abrasive and had a huge attitude and it was a very uncomfortable situation. I feel that it would have been more appropriate for a manager to come ask questions if there was an issue. We ended up figured out they they actually gave my fiancé a Merlot and me the wrong Rose so BOTH drinks were wrong. The bartender returned with a check and then continued to blame us by saying \"you need to order from people in the white shirts not the ones in the black shirts because the woman you ordered from doesn't even speak English and she is just a runner.\" Then why did she take our order? Why did we see her take 3 more orders while we were sitting there? Don't blame patrons for your flaws City Lights!! Savannah didn't take our order because she wasn't suppose to so if Anna wasn't suppose maybe the right person should have been sent over. I think Colton needs to be reevaluated because his attitude is horrible and treated guests like they were scum for asking for our check to be fixed. 

Needless to say it's just not worth the headache to come here. Like many of the other reviews say I also would rather go to Fahrenheit!!!"}
{"text":"It is unfortunate too see some of the highly critical and negative reviews of this place. I personally had a positive experience. The cocktails are fantastic, atmosphere on point, and view of the city beautiful! 

The staff was all hospitable, genuinely friendly, and helpful when guiding us up to the rooftop. 

One employee in particular made the experience a memorable one. Kyana, the bartender was amazing! She helped our group decide on cocktails and was very patient with all our questions about the drink list. She is very knowledgable and makes a great Cosmo! 

Our group will definitely be back for another ladies night!"}
{"text":"I love love love this rooftop bar, and wish I could afford to go every weekend! The views are spectacular and the drinks are a lot nicer than Fahrenheight IMO. 

It is located on top of the meridian hotel, so it's relatively easy to find. There's no parking lot for it though, so you need to pay at the hotel or find street parking nearby. 

The whole process getting up to the bar is really neat to my inner child. You go up the elevator to the very top floor, meet the doorman to check your ID, walk through a swanky lounge and hallway to your staircase ascending to the bar. Super neat!

The staff has always been beyond friendly and they take the time to talk to you about each drink and what may suite your palate. There were two younger girls that tried to cut line in front of me, and the bartender came to me first which was nice. 

The drinks are a bit pricey, but the overall experience is worth it. The outdoor area has plenty of seating and standing room. I would only suggest turning the music down a little bit. Otherwise, I love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely pretentious with brazen and impudent clientele in their early to mid 20s. I only came for the view as the hotel I was staying at had recommended it. Parking is hourly or you can get valet. The views are most amazing. Definitely go for that! Drinks were being charged ridiculous prices. Not even San Francisco and New York bars charge this much! Anyway, they had an event going on which I actually won. I was supposed to get a $100 bar tab, but that didn't happen. I ended up with a cheap bottle of prosecco. The atmosphere was interesting. I liked that they had giant screens that played movies. There was loads of patio furniture offered as seating. The DJ kept playing basic songs. No one was dancing, excepting the drunk older couple. It wasn't all that bad, but it wasn't fantastic. I wasted two hours of my life here and left completely disappointed! Come if you can stand people using the word 'like' incorrectly, at a rate of every three words and if you are into a crowd that stuffs their pants, both front and back. I say this earnestly- please stop with the butt pads and just squat!"}
{"text":"Ehh...not impressed with City Lights. The outdoor rooftop is gorgeous, so enjoy the view, at least visit for that. It's cool to explore the few CLT rooftops there are. 

The bartenders the evening I went  (a Thursday) had horrible bar vision. I didn't get an eye contact or acknowledgement for awhile, despite me standing there attempting to subtly get their attention- I'm not the \"snap your fingers & whistle\" patron, it's rude and bar keeps hate it. If I did tho.  I may have gotten served. 

Liquor selection - mediocre
King of Pops Sparkle drink - it's Prosecco & a pop dipped in it, $15. The drink was decent but not $15. 

Not a fan"}
{"text":"Amazing view and great atmosphere! No where else in Charlotte has a rooftop feel or view quite like city lights! 

The bar just opened tonight so I think they are having some growing pains. Drinks were a tiny bit inconsistent and bartenders seemed overwhelmed.  If City lights can figure that out than it will become a great bar here in Charlotte! I will 100% be back."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk into this modern hotel you are instantly enveloped in European chic; however, if you walk to the right of the lobby, get the white clad elevator assistant to get you to the 18th floor, and walk up a flight of stairs you are greeted with a sleek modern bar and an amazing 360 degree view of Charlotte. City Lights Rooftop Bar, the hottest new rooftop bar in Charlotte, is great for cocktails after work or before dinner! Seating is limited and this place fills up fast! You can enjoy the skyline view while sipping on one of their many cocktails or drinks. My favorite, and what everyone seems to be raving about recently, is the King Poptails. King Pops meet glasses of prosecco to equal one sweet concoction -- a pair meant to be!"}
{"text":"The view was nice but the service was HORRIBLE. Never got drinks, never got food. Manager did not even know how to handle problems. Never came to apologize or anything ! Don't go if you want anything to drink"}
{"text":"I took my first Charlotte skyline snapshots from City Lights when I first moved here three weeks ago. Located in Uptown, the rooftop at Le Méridien Charlotte Hotel offers spectacular  360-degree view of Charlotte. 
If you're in the mood to cool off with ice pop in Prosecco (as I was), trendy rooftop bar, and usually overcrowded, yet fun place to hang out and enjoy one of the most gorgeous view of the city, this is where you need to be.

{"text":"This goes on my list of GREAT ROOFTOPS!

The food & cocktails are ALL DELICOUS - I think we ordered everything on the meal twice.  We came for sunset and stayed into the night.  It's not really a music venue - more for cocktails and conversation."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. The view is worth it just alone. Grab a drink and some appetizer and you have yourself a nice place to chill before grabbing some dinner or dance floor. End the night with a beautiful view of the Charlotte skyline."}
{"text":"You pay a premium here for the view, and it's admittedly a killer one. City Lights is beautiful - an expansive, spacious rooftop with panoramic views of the Charlotte skyline. I was there a few weeks ago and they had a keyboardist covering Billy Joel tunes (quite well, too) so that didn't hurt either. You'll feel like a B-list celebrity for hanging out here. 

Go on Sundays - take advantage of the rose-all-day promotion, even if, like me, you're not crazy about sweet pink wine. It's a damn good price for alcohol on a pretty rooftop. Just go here so that you can say that you did."}
{"text":"I stayed at the downstairs hotel ; Le Meridien. So the rooftop bar is advertised and suggested. After the first night my friends and I decided to go! The view is really good, and there's a lot of space and it's lively! The DJ isn't good at all, that was the biggest con of the night. I enjoyed the drinks, they were moderately price. All night, the workers was coming around cleaning and taking glasses which was great!"}
{"text":"Overall, I like the furniture and spacious rooftop patio that City Lights has. It truly was a perfect spot to enjoy the sunset on a summer evening!

However, the music was WAY too loud. It was only 8pm, and they were bumping club music. My friend and I had to move twice to find a seat where we didn't have to yell over the speakers. It definitely ruined the ambience - it's got a classy feel and I'd prefer more chill music at a reasonable volume.

The drink selection is pretty standard. I'm not blown away by any of the cocktails, and they've got a typical wine and beer selection.

Definitely worth coming for the novelty, but not much else."}
{"text":"So disappointed went Friday night. There were multiple cockroaches running around. One was running across the lounge sofas. The waitress said it was because they sprayed. These roaches were fearless and bold out in the open. We had to leave we were so disgusted."}
{"text":"I am surprised that it took me so long to discover this place! I first saw the whole popsicle in drink concept in New York when I was visiting the High Line. I'm glad that I can find this in Charlotte as well {BUT}...

First off, did anyone else have a lot of trouble finding this bar? My friend kept telling me that it was located NEXT to Le Meridian. Here I am walking around the surrounding hotels looking like a tourist! Finally, someone directed us inside the hotel and brought us upstairs. City Lights rooftop is located on the 18th floor. The elevator ride can get a little awkward since you're going up so many floors!

When my friend and I arrived, we weren't even greeted. As we approached the bar, no one asked what we wanted either. I had to ask for a menu and of course, I wanted to try the drink with the popsicle. For $14, it's definitely NOT worth it. The quantity of drink they pour you is so inconsistent too. My friend got significantly more wine than me. Another friend had also ordered wings, and after 30 minutes, it still wasn't done yet. We just canceled the order. THey didn't even apologize for the wait or anything. Don't get food from here unless you are ok with waiting for a while. 

Thankfully the views were beautiful so it made my time here nice. I wouldn't recommend coming here though. Hopefully there are better rooftop bars with better service."}
{"text":"Weak drink and service was awful. Bartenders not attentive to customer service. View is nice, the only positive thing about it."}
{"text":"When I arrived, there was no one to direct us where to sit. After asking the attendant at the door, who told us to sit anywhere, we were greeted by 3 empty tables all with other parties' leftovers on it. We chose one, sat down, and the cushion was completely soaked from the rain, which the attendant didn't tell us prior to sitting down. After trying to dry off, it took about 10 minutes just to get a menu. Needless to say, service was subpar."}
{"text":"City Lights has by far the best view in Charlotte! The King of Pops in Champagne is to die for, and is perfect with the weather right now. But the drinks are very expensive, 14 dollar cocktails and not a particularly good menu are balanced out by the view and decoration at the rooftop bar. Service was good for us but I've read that they aren't usually the best. 

It's a good spot for groups because of seating and it's not too windy for pictures (just throwing that out there for my fellow females), I'd prefer going here than Fahrenheit anyday!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and pretty view!!! 
We got a few food items ... Took forever and nothing special especially for the price. I would definitely eat prior to coming!!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte for a wedding and researching local spots that were a must to hit. Everyone raved about this trendy rooftop so I had to see it for myself!

1. The view rocks, if you're visiting Charlotte and looking to see the city, you've got to check out this spot. Go in the afternoon and grab a cold one and watch the sunset fall behind the skyscrapers.

2. Get the Sparkle + Pop drink. (Your choice of Champagne or Rosé and your flavor popsicle). Yes it's trendy and yes it's pricey ($14), but it's seriously refreshing and so cute for a picture! You really only need one. 

3. Drinks areeeeeeee pricey here. It's a rooftop, you're paying for the scenery, the vibe and view. But it's a really cool spot and something different! Bring a few friends, have a cocktail or two, and move on to the next bar!"}
{"text":"You know it's bad when you receive better service from the Security than the wait staff. Yesterday was my first visit to this location and probably my last...unless I'm not sober. ;) However, I'm giving City Lights 3 stars because the view is AMAZING and because of the service recovery. 

I thought this would be a great place for a daytime date with my guy and finally a chance to try out those infamous popsicle drinks, which by the way were amazing, but we waited for over 15 mins for two drinks. And not just waiting, but attempting to get the attention of THREE people serving maybe 5 people for the span of those 15 mins. You would've thought this place was packed by the way the staff continuously overlooked us as we were basically climbing over the bar to get their attention. It took about 5 mins for us to even get the drink menu and then another 10 mins to actually put in an order. I mean how many times do you need to say, \"Excuse me, sir\" before you start to think something else is going on. \"Do I look broke right now?\" \"Is it because I'm not with the \"boys in suits\" over there?\" Like c'mon! Sooo frustrating. This MIGHT'VE been understandable if it wasn't for how empty the place was. 

Once we finally got our drinks and picked a place to sit down, we watched a cocktail waitress stop at every seating area except ours. We were trying to get her attention, but she didn't seem to notice. Instead we waved down Security to help us out and they were extremely nice. :) 

After about an hr, one of the bartenders came over to apologize for our experience at the bar and offered us two free drinks. We accepted and it took only about 2 mins for him to return with the drinks. While I appreciate a great service recovery, it wouldn't have been necessary if the appropriate level of customer service was given from the beginning."}
{"text":"One star for the great view. I was overcharged $80 for 3 beers and 2 well drinks. Insane. Will NEVER return. If you choose to go - bring cash!  Learned my lesson. Also the crowd is a bizarre mix of pretentious kids. If you're late 20's and up ...prob should check out a much cooler spot in uptown or NoDa. 

There are better bars to go to with views! Don't say I didn't warn you!"}
{"text":"An addition to Charlotte rooftop bar scene. The view is great. The place is busy but the wait to get  on top is not bad. Now the drinks are mediocre and overpriced. Bar service is not the best either. Not a bad place to check out once."}
{"text":"We were super excited to try this place out this past Friday . The venue is the rooftop floor of Le Meridien hotel . No cover charge to get in , beautiful view of downtown skyline and a DJ . Needless to say pretty excited to give the place a try . Some of the things that knocked this review from a 4 to a 2, the bartenders seemed to ignore us even when there was no one up there . We had to literally try to get their attention like 3 times . The worst of all though was the place had COCKROACHES running around the rooftop , like so disgusting . Imagine my surprise as  I'm sipping my prosecco and a bug runs in front of my feet , yikes !   Being all the way on the 18th floor I would think bugs like that wouldn't even be up there , but apparently they must be running rampant in the hotel or something , really don't know . I'd probably try them again just to see if this was a one time fluke  , but I'll make sure to wear closed toes shoes and be on guard for  bugsssss!"}
{"text":"The 2 stars are for the amazing view and our awesome cocktail waiter. Everything else was sub par. Drink service at the bar is ridiculously slow. I got ignored by one of the bartenders for almost 20 minutes and the place wasn't that busy yet. Once we were seated, my friend got acquainted with one of the cocktail waiters and he was great. The bar is on the roof of the La Meridian hotel and there was only one elevator to get to the top, so prepare for a wait. It's worth a trip for the view and experience but the service should be better for how expensive it is."}
