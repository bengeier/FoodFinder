{"text":"Ok. I was at this location on the weekend and I will say the food is good. Here's why I won't return. The owner in a vary unprofessional manner treated an employee poorly in front of customers. Yelling at the young boy in front of everyone. If an employer has an issue with an employee the should take  the issue in private. Not scream for all to hear."}
{"text":"Wow! Fantastic flavour; huge portion. Definitely will be back! Did take out but decor is really nice, very welcoming."}
{"text":"Was in the area and tried the place.

Food was really good and decent priced , and big portions. Also well seasoned. 

The owner was nice and friendly and caters to all your requests. Busy during lunch time, but the service is speedy and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"I FINALLY FOUND A SHAWARMA NEAR MY HOUSE!  

We recently moved near Bolton and we found a hard time finding a place that had good food. My dad was recommended this restaurant by a friend to try it out. So my dad brought home a shawarma plate for us. After trying it out, I've been going back ever since. The restaurant is clean, and looks really nice inside. I haven't had a chance to sit down and eat, mostly have done take out. I love how you can substitute for fries or rice for the plates. The staff is really friendly and fast service. One thing you should know is that the portions are really big. Which make the price well worth it. Only thing that sucks about the place is the parking lot. There isn't many parking spots and many times I have to park at the back. Overall I would definitely go back, the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"The owner Mustafa taamneh is a thief and a scammer. He stole people's money before closing his restaurant on Dixie. He changed his phone number and opened la shawarma with stolen money. I doubt that he cater halal since his money is not halal to start with!!"}
{"text":"The place has a great environment inside, and the food is good. The shawarma on the rocks and salads (Greek and Caesar) could be better (all the same iceberg lettuce with different dressings and canned diced olives), but the shawarma wraps are really good and much larger than the shawarma wraps you're used to having.

The shawarma dinners are really good but almost 20 dollars after all is said and done.

Best bet: try the shawarma wraps, they're all good."}
{"text":"Really happy to have found this gem near my house! Great ambiance and customer service. My mother and I ordered a plate of falafels with some rice and also a chicken Kabob wrap and some hummus with pita! The portions are definitely a lot more than what we were expecting. We did end up packing some of the meal and didng quite get to the wrap either. One meal can easily serve two here :)"}
{"text":"I've had two meals here since they opened. Staff are super-friendly, extremely welcoming, trying very hard to build up their reputation, which is sincere and great. The sit down is nice, great atmosphere - wood tabletops, wood paneling on the walls, modern light fixtures, marble bar top - casual, but stepped up. My only objection is that the shawarma is a little dry and only works if you add sauces. It's an easy thing to fix and it'll quickly make this place a 5."}
{"text":"I had the chicken shawarma wrap there while on a recent business trip to Bolton and I can honestly say that it was one of the tastiest sandwiches I've had. The restaurant is tightly nestled between a Subway and Popeyes Fried Chicken and the owners are quite friendly and accommodating.  I'm looking forward to being back in Bolton and coming back to La Shawarma."}
{"text":"Ordered a meal for take out. Place looks really nice inside but we were all disappointed with our meals... Don't order from here unless you want your order messed up. I was so disappointed :( This meal was so terrible I will not eat schawarma again in Bolton UNLESS it's at bona pita. Unfortunately they were closed and I resorted to this place. Worst decision of 2018 so far."}
{"text":"I work in Bolton, and stop by various places for lunch. 
Bolton is a small town, and I would try to rate it relative to other places locally.

Speed read:
1) Good price, speedy service
2) Nicely decorated - they inherited everything from Hole-E burger.
3) Alcohol and Patio!  
4) Hard to find Parking

The hot and new place for Bolton
Patio, Alcohol, good price, good food, fast service.  Awesome place for lunch.
The only reason it's not getting a 5 star is the lack of parking in this plaza.  
We had the Kabab, and I would say it's very well seasoned.  I am not an expert on Shawarma.
For $5.99 with a free pop, I would say it's a very good for deal for lunch.  The wrap is a little smaller than Bona Pita, but it fill me up well.  

Definitely will go back to try the BBQ 1/2 Chicken Combo for $9.99.
It's always convenient to finish up with a Starbuck next door.

If you read it this far, here is a tip for lunch.
Go early to find parking.

{"text":"this place is disgusting from the owner sam to the food. burnt dried up chicken thats been left to burn on the spinning grill for hours due to lack of customers (not surprised). gave us two burnt chicken shawarmas came back to the store to ask for refund or exchange. he threw the wraps in the garbage and said no refunds or exchange i was left with no choice but to give them the f word and he tried to fight me inside his store. if it wasnt for his employees holding me back i would have turned him into a shawarma and give him a taste of his own medicine. people like him and businesses like that should not be allowed to operate at all."}
{"text":"Quick stop after a long  home. Delicious, huge portions and cheap!!!
Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"WOW, very different experience from my first visit...Today, I decided to try the fish and chips,  the picture on the menu board showed a fresh battered fish with chips. I asked what kind of fish it was and was told Haddock. Sounded great and I ordered. 
I was beside myself when I received two flat pieces of previously frozen \"Mc Fish\" that tasted horrible and soaking in oil. When the waitress asked how it was and I told her that this was not what was advertised. She told me \"not my choice\" and never came back. After this I also heard my family say it doesn't taste like the last time. 

Is this business already starting to cut corners and going into a nose dive? Not sure I'd return a next time after this sad meal and experience. Not happy even after letting them know I was snowballed!!"}
