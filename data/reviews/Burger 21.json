{"text":"The burger was excellent! The fries were meh, the shake was meh. But the place is known for burgers so I would go back for that alone!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! I had the mushroom burger and sweet potato fries. Very juicy with a nice thick burger patty. Decor is nice too. Excellent place to grab lunch. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went today and was not terribly impressed. They are experiencing new business pains, and the service is really slow.  We waited for about 20 minutes to get served after ordering, then my burger was wrong and they had to re-do it. Another 20 minutes later, my re-fire finally showed up. They offered a milkshake to make up for the slow service and the staff was nice about everything.  The food was nothing to write home about. The burger was average. The fries were nice and crispy. The milkshake was not very good - it had an unpleasant aftertaste."}
{"text":"Food, service and milkshakes were amazing!!! Staff was extremely helpful! We walked in about 45 minutes before they closed and they welcomed us with smiles and fresh food!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not surprised to see this location closed. The service was absolutely horrible. The French fries we ordered were cold and tasted of rancid oil. When we brought this to managers attention he then asked us if we would like hotter fries. I responded \"not if you cook them in the same oil.\"Then would not give me a refund for the fries we turned away. I wouldn't eat in any of their other locations."}
{"text":"Beef burgers were good, but don't get the Shrimp burger unless you like eating a mushy mousse-like texture... The shrimp burger also had no flavor... I've had shrimp burgers before that were entirely made of shrimp and not full of fillers... Gag."}
{"text":"Order took too long, it was cold, and how can a burger be pretty costly and taste like crap...I ate at Zin Burger and although they too are expensive, ordered a Kobi burger for 15.00 at least it was delish.. but not in my neighborhood,  so I must say the best quality burgers are made at Whole Foods,  and the Bison is awesome. ..don't wast your money ..Shakes looked good but not for like $6.00..."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised. The decor was modern and inviting. The service was fast and friendly. Tad bit pricey but I feel like the quality of the food is worth it. I'll have to try a shake next time."}
{"text":"Love this place....great for the entire family! The turkey burgers are awesome!"}
{"text":"Let's be real here.  This is my favorite place in town.  I swear it's hard to not eat here every day.  My go-to meal would be a Black and Bleu burger with a creme brûlée milkshake, but don't be afraid to try anything and everything on the menu.  My 3-yr old nephew loves the turkey chili!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! The Turkey burger was the best I have ever had. No hormones just organic and tasty !"}
{"text":"Not much taste to the burgers or fries for that matter. Employees were great. Nice inside."}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied with dirty appearance on Friday.  The table we sat at was filthy and was still sticky after using an alcohol wipe. Food on floor.Lots of folks working there, but no one cleaning up.  Seems to be a trend here....should focus on cleaning up the place."}
{"text":"Meh. As other reviews have noted, Burger 21 is overpriced. For 2 adults and 1 child, we spent $35. And, for what? Two burgers, 2 drinks, an order of sweet potato fries, and a children's meal. The burgers and fries were OK.  My boyfriend said, \"I don't need to come back here.\" I agree."}
{"text":"It was my first time there and the cashier went through the whole menu with me and explained every choice to me. I ended up ordering the Black Bean Burger and was impressed. My husband was equally impressed with his Tex Mex Haystack Burger. Will be back. Fun place for kids."}
{"text":"I consider Burger 21 to be a close competitor of Smashburger.  However, I would say that Burger 21 is a bit more refined or less fast-foody than Smashburger.  The burgers are very good and I like that Burger 21 has some unique \"burgers\" on their menu.  Their shrimp burger is an interesting feature.  I thought it would be whole shrimp sort of like a shrimp po'boy.  Instead, it's ground shrimp in a patty form...with a lot of spice!  Quite interesting.  Be sure to brace yourself for the heat if you get it.  Burger 21 also has awesome shakes.  But you could get on serious calorie overload if you get a burger, fries, and shake.  But what the heck, right?  Overall, I like Burger 21.  Keep it on your short list for a more refined, \"faster food\", burger."}
{"text":"Ordering setup is awkward.  The staff at the registers were very friendly.  We ordered 2 regular burgers and a kids burger.  The kids burger was somewhat dry and tasteless, but my 3.5 year old ate it.  He wanted chocolate milk, but we got somewhat warm white milk with 1 squirt of chocolate syrup. It still tasted like white milk, and warm, ugh.   Took it back and asked for chocolate milk.  It sat for about 5-10 minutes and they then just added another squirt of syrup and now it was warmer slightly chocolate tasting milk.  I sent it back and replaced with apple juice.  Had a regular milkshake and a kids milkshake.  Both were just okay and ended up being a chocolate milk consistency after about 10 minutes on our table.  The fries with ale and cheese sauce were not too great either.  The fries were not hot or crispy.  They were soft and flimsy and not much taste.  The cheese sauce was not cheese and did not have hardly any taste.  We did not eat much of it.  My blue cheese burger had a meager slice of bacon (supposed to be applewood smoked bacon) and a small amount of blue cheese/sauce.  The burger was small for the bun size and the price.    Overall, I probably won't come back here when there are so many better burger options, even McDonalds across the street would be competitive in quality and taste, and much lower cost. Five Guys, BRGR, Burgatory are all light years ahead of this place.    I have 2 stars because the staff were very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"In living right across the street from this place, I was hoping that it would be great.  Everything about the food was mediocre.  I knew we were in trouble when the guy at the counter didn't ask how we wanted our burgers cooked.  Again, the burger itself was just ok. Seeing how it is a burger restaurant, their staple needs to sparkle.  Unfortunately it did not.  We have never gone back...but we drive by it all of the time and wave as we pass it by to go out for a great burger.  The sauce bar was unique, but again, nothing special that would bring us back."}
{"text":"The burger was great( bacon cheezy) and cooked just right(medium rare). The fries came out fresh but small shoestring size, still good. The sauces was a pull for me to go. Sadly those fell short. Thai ketchup was maybe the best, other than that it was blah. BBQ, ranch,honey mustard, chipotle mayo and ranchero? That was like a ranch chipotle mayo mix. The oreo shake was great."}
{"text":"As I walked in to what I thought was gonna be another cliche burger place I was pleasantly surprised at what I saw. There was old fashion burger place style integrated with a contemporary design, a very warm welcome.   The burgers look great and taste great. Their fries are better then others, you can tell by the taste.   They have a bunch of dipping sauces to choose from. They have your regular ketchup and a marshmallow sauce for those inclined.   It's a casual vibe and the staff treats you like friends. When our server brought out our food he said \" shits boom dude\". I'm sure his boss wouldn't like hearing that but I found it funny and comforting.   Great atmosphere. Great fries. Great burger"}
{"text":"They made a mistake on my order..no big deal. However, I brought it to the manager who apologized, but wouldn't redo the order unless I paid the $1.50 difference, to get what I originally ordered! I've been coming here since it opened and I'm outraged that they actually made me pay before they'd fix it. My entire family was done with their meals before I even got my \"fixed\" order. Should have never charged the $1.50 for their mistake!!!! Hope it was worth it because they just lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Had the Bacon Cheesy burger - good, but the bun was a bit greasy.   My friend had the Philly Cheese burger - too many sauces mixed together, so she didn't finish it.  She has a vanilla shake, good, like a Fribble.  We got fries & the onion strings as a side.  They aren't on the menu, but you can ask for them."}
{"text":"Went very excited to try out these burgers and was pretty disappointed. The chicken burger itself is good but the toppings (I got the Mexican burger) left something to be desired. The fries were decent and the service was good. My father came with and got a different chicken burger and liked it. I like the setup and the ambiance. Overall, wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Really good burgers.  Price is reflective of quality, so it's definitely not the cheapest, but not the most expensive either. Burgers are large and they have all sorts of different flavor ketchup. They also serve bottled beer. Nice patio area."}
{"text":"We had a very poor experience here. 2 adults and 2 kids on a Friday night. They forgot 1/2 of our order. It took 30 minutes to get 2 burgers, a grilled cheese sandwich, and a grilled chicken sandwich. The regular fries (not the sweet potato fries) reminded me of my high school cafeteria (frozen food company fries). The grilled chicken was some kind of mystery ground chicken. Very odd texture and didn't taste good. We won't be going back. Too many other good burger spots.   One extra star because my wife liked her burger."}
{"text":"First visit to Burger 21. Ordered the Burger 101 and onion strings to go. The onion strings were so heavily coated with salt I could not even eat them. The burger was very salty as well and did not finish it. Very disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"2nd time in a row they messed up my burger. I will not be back. Good food once it came out though"}
{"text":"New burger place in our area, decided to give it a try for dinner on a Monday night. You walk in and order your food at the counter, they give you a number and then bring it out to you.   Food = REALLY good! The burgers were cooked perfectly, and all the ingredients tasted fresh. My favorite part...they have a condiment bar! I didn't count but I'd guess there are at least 10 different sauces to pick from. This is helpful for someone like me who is super indecisive. We also ordered a large regular fry to share and they were also prepared perfectly!  Service = Also great! Our burgers came out within 10 minutes (if that), and we were checked on once during our meal. After we finished someone came by and cleared our table. That's pretty attentive service for a place without waiters.  Atmosphere = The set-up is a little odd, the drink/condiment station is in the middle of the restaurant. All the tables are pretty close together so it really lacks any sort of privacy. Kind of feels like a big, bright cafeteria. They do have a big patio area which was empty, maybe if they have some heaters out there that'd be a nice option next time. And I noticed Burger 21 is dog-friendly!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger and service. Food brought to your table. Highly recommend the bacon cheesy. It's an amazing burger cooked to your liking topped with your choice of cheese as well as crispy applewood smoked bacon. Their burgers are so juicy and flavorful. I'll be back their for more. It is a little pricy but it is very much worth it."}
{"text":"Not going back. Went in on a Sunday at 3pm to get take out. Waited what seemed like a long \"10 minutes\" for nobody to be in there at the time. Drove 5 minutes home. Turkey burger looked like a McDonalds chicken nugget and had wilted lettuce. Tasted ok but nothing great. Got the mixed fries. They were nearly cold and getting mushy. The regular fries tasted like cardboard. I even spit one out that was just pure cold grease. Sweet potato fries were too thin. I would guess they made the fries first and then the burgers took awhile longer so we ended up with cold fries when we got home. Not sure this place will last if they don't improve!"}
{"text":"Horrible Service.  They made the wrong sandwich and when I told them it was wrong they said I would need to come pay for the correct sandwich because it was $3.50 more then what they had rung up.  It then took three servers and a manager to figure out how to correct the ticket on the register and charge me the difference.  I had also order fries for the table and when they took back my sandwich to make the correct one they also took the fries.  I had to request the fries several times from a server.  Felt bad for the others at my table because they had their sandwiches but did not have fries to go with it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this area! We needed something good but quick to eat between soccer games & this was great! The Black Bean Burger was juicy & cooked to perfection! The kids loved their salads & hubby enjoyed his burger!"}
{"text":"Ordered a to-go order, came to pick it up only to find it had been given away to another customer and that they could either refund us or remake the order. Had them remake it, got home and one of our orders was wrong and we were missing the side of frys that we had paid for. Food was nothing but below average. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"We got a coupon in the mail & gave this place a try.  Absolutely loved the burgers!  I got a Marsala Chicken & my husband got the Tex-Mex burger.  Both were super good.  Bonus - they have a ton of fun condiments to go with the fries and burgers.   Decor was nice & service was even better :-)  Will def be coming here more often for my burger cravings.  Next time, I will definitely give the shrimp burger a try :-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place. We live out in Matthews and we typically go eat there or get something to go every weekend. The sauces they have are so yummy, the sweet potato fries are always hot and fresh and the burgers are the best ! I cannot have gluten and I love that I can eat here and get everything gluten free and not have to miss out!"}
{"text":"So. The Ahi burger was delicious. Nicely seared, not overcooked. The burger was juicy and the bun was pleasantly sweet.  Why do people skimp on fries? I've never understood this. It's the least expensive thing on the planet, you might as well load me up so I'm satisfied. They were thin and crispy and plenty of different sauces to appease any craving.   I wouldn't rave about this place but I expect I'll be back here at some point to try the Thai shrimp burger."}
{"text":"Long wait times for a nearly raw burger. This is our second visit with the same results. Not recommended."}
{"text":"20 minutes for a burger! Although the TexMex sounded delicious, it was undercooked! Service was slow for the second time and two of our four burgers were undercooked. I will go spend my $10/burger somewhere else... unimpressed..."}
{"text":"I ordered the Skinny Turkey Burger.  The worst Turkey Burger I have ever had.  It was dense, dry and without flavor.  The lettuce and tomato were sparse at best."}
{"text":"They recently opened up and had a nice energy about the place.  And they had plenty of people working the floor and counter.  The burger is custom made to your order.  The french fries were really good and presented well.  They do not rush you so you can sit and chat with your friends for a while.  Wishing them success."}
{"text":"Visited Burger 21 last week for lunch and I agree with some of the other reviews with regards to parking.  It can be hard to find a spot near Burger 21 upon arrival, but I looped around a few times and was able to find a spot within a few minutes.  I was greeted by a vary friendly young lady at the register who helped me decide on what to order by going thru the menu with me.  I ended up ordering the Black and Bleu Burger with regular fries and a Coke.  There was plenty of seating and within a few minutes I had my food at the table.  The dipping sauce station was very cool.  I tried the Thai Ketchup and the Chipotle Mayo.  Both very good!!    My burger was cooked perfectly!!  The fries were very good as well.  The place is very nicely decorated and very clean.  Just an overall good experience and I will treat myself again every now and then.....  Happy Yelpin'......."}
{"text":"Burgers are ok. I prefer without the bun. This weekend felt I had a better burger at whiskey row. Service is interesting... They don't seem to be focused. Clean atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great burgers and shakes. Could use some improvement in cleanliness and service but overall it was a great meal. Many options on the menu. Turkey burgers and hot dogs too."}
{"text":"I had their sonoma salad with grilled chicken. It took forever for the food to come out. I was hoping that it was going to be an awesome salad, but it was average. Fired Pie in the same complex makes an awesome salad!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place! And I have Never ever liked a Burger before...I've tried Kobe beef and ostrich,...nope!The burgers are cooked to your version of perfection...even if its unusual! I love the staff is kind (Gillian) and friendly. They also have really reasonably priced milkshakes that are out of this world good!!! I would eat there everynight if I could!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was so nice! The girl in the front named Dominique was so incredibly sweet and made a great first impression right off the bat. They have two really nice vegetarian options (try the bean burger)! Fries are bought separately but they aren't over priced and the regular was plenty. I got a totally filling bean burger and fries for 10$ and the service was impressive and very nice and welcoming. Loved it! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Good Burgers! Kids love the place! Milkshake with cinnamon on the whipped cream could cause a lot of problems for your kids. My kids threw there's on the floor they said the cinnamon ruined the milkshake. This place is expensive"}
{"text":"After my previous review, owner himself of Burger 21 called to discuss my unfortunate experience.  Todd was wonderful and very interested in the feedback that I gave. He sent me a burger bucks gift certificate for me to come back and try again. I went this past Wednesday evening with a friend, and service was swift, the staff very nice and the food was great. So wonderful to have a business that truly cares about your experience and they will follow up with you to try to make things right if there's a problem. I will come back!"}
{"text":"there service was fabulous and burgers were  on point!  I highly recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"Great little spot to eat. my dad and i were greeted right away and we instantly noticed to quality of the shakes and the burgers they bringing to the guest who were already sitting.   he asked me how i liked my burger and thats how i got it.  the coolest part was the varieties of sauces they have and the AMAZIINNG and beautifully crafted works of art they call milkshakes. i had the chocolate malt shake and it brought a single tear to my eye. it was so good. i recomend anyone \come in on a hot day and just grab themselves one of those. the burgers were great too but i was overwhelmed by how good the shakes were. you wont be dissapointed trying this place. i know youve driven by several times and thought about it just like it did;)"}
{"text":"I've been here on two different occasions.   The first time, it was around lunch and not busy. The order took forever to come out, but it was very tasty. I had a Tex-Mex burger. The meat is so juicy and flavorful, I didn't even mind all the grease that oozes out when you bite into it.   The second time around, the place was packed. We had to wait a bit before snagging a booth that was newly vacant. Luckily, the food came out quicker than the last trip. I had the Cheesy Bacon with a lettuce wrap instead of a bun. They forgot the bacon -__-  It was just the patty with cheese, I had to get my own condiments (Chipotle mayo is heaven). I also ordered a kids chicken tender meal for my toddler, but they forgot to bring his juice. He enjoyed his food nonetheless.   Next time I go, I'm ordering a milkshake."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger entree with sweet potato fries. The fries came out tasting like they were set outside for too long. I might go back if there were no other options.   This place had mediocre service so I didn't bother to ask for a redo on the fries.   I liked the restaurant environment. I might go back again."}
{"text":"The milkshakes are sooo good! I got the chocolate malted milk ball...now I want to go back and try them all! The black and bleu burger was a bit too salty for me but good. My mom got the black bean burger and said it was great.  Great fries. I got sooo full. Both Regular and sweet potato and good selection of burgers. . . will return!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and good fries, also have really good shakes, will definitely come back"}
{"text":"First of all, the staff here is SO nice. Second, they offer a number of gluten-free options (*not* just salads), and all their delicious sauces are gluten-free.  The first time I visited, as soon as I mentioned I wanted a gluten-free bun, the staff was quick to let me know what was and wasn't gluten-free on the menu, down to the seasoning on the sweet potato fries. The second time I visited, I found the staff just as knowledgeable and helpful.   The staff is very hospitable - they check on you without being obtrusive, and no request is too small or too silly. The second time I visited, my best friend from college had come down to see me after more than a decade of not seeing each other, and when the manager came over to check on us he asked if the music could possibly be turned down a bit. (Since we were early and the first ones there, it seemed louder than it would have otherwise.) The manager immediately turned it down and soon after, came out to check to see if the new volume was as my friend hoped. So nice!  Another thoughtful touch: the hand-washing sink near the back entrance.   The prices are a tad high for burgers and fries but not more than other local places, and their sauces are amazing, especially the honey mustard and apple cider sauces. (Try the toasted marshmallow sauce at least once!) And you can use your Ballantyne card to get a discount.  My one wish: if you have a gluten allergy and you also don't eat beef, there are no burger options for you. The turkey and veggie burgers are made with bread crumbs. During my second visit I ended up just getting a basket of sweet potato fries since I really don't eat beef, and the staff obviously felt terrible. They kept asking if there was anything else they could possibly get me. Again, so nice."}
{"text":"This is for those of you looking for gluten free food--this place was wonderful. I have extremely sensitive celiac disease and can never eat out when I'm in my hometown, as no restaurants there understand how to cook for and serve someone with celiac disease. I always get sick. While in Charlotte visiting family, we went to Burger 21 and I decided to give it a try since it had great reviews on the Find Me Gluten Free app. I'm so happy I did! They have a gluten free menu so you don't have to wonder at all what's safe. The people working there seemed very cautious with my order as well. They have a completely separate preparation area and fryer for gluten free orders. The burger I had was delicious, and so were the fries. Not a single hint of a reaction, either! My family also loved their meals. I definitely wish we had one of these in Houston."}
{"text":"Clearly i'm the minority (although don't really see anyone addressing cost/value) and even with a decent net worth, must be much poorer than most of the patrons here.  Must be slumming from 131 Main as could just about eat at Firebirds for this cost!  Over $30 for two that has a 'decent' burger and fries that look very similar to Ore-Ida Frozen Fries?  I would hesitate going again even if the beef was truly Wagyu/Kobe, but then again, i get 1/2 a cow ground up into hamburger from Frontier Meats annually!  After the typical initial hub bub of the restaurant groupies, will be amazed if this place is still open in 3 years..but then again, Panera makes it !"}
{"text":"The burgers are top notch, high quality, very tasty with soft buns that don't get in the way.  I love the sink in the dining room to get your greasy hands clean afterwards as you head for the door.  But I'm not feeling the fries.  They are kind of dry and thin and tasteless or rather taste like frozen, long frozen something, not potatoes.  If they fixed that this would be a dreamy place to eat all the way around.  I also wish the straws were longer as they sell glass bottles of soda and the short straws fall inside."}
{"text":"Tala the girl who took our order seemed like she could careless. Our first time. Was not impressed. She didn't offer cheeses until I asked then charged extra without telling us. Wait took forever to get food. Price seemed high for what you get. Wish we would have been informed about the sauce bar before ordering basic ketchup and mustard. Other than that, food was pretty decent. Would eat there again but wish the staff was more friendly and informative."}
{"text":"The entrance/register layout was a little confusing but overall a very fun, fresh atmosphere. Burger sliders were delightful, juicy little beef patties on sweet hawaiian rolls - yum! What really sold me was the variety of sauces for the burgers and fries! A whole Sauce Bar with tons of choices. So fun! Join their email club and get a free milkshake on your birthday too. :) Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place for a great burger. Frequently go after sports games and practices. The staff have always been helpful and nice. Good prices for Ballantyne."}
{"text":"I really liked this place when they first opened.  I went back for a second visit with my family and was disappointed with the entire experience.   One of the people with us orders a shake that came halfway through the meal. I have a tomato allergy and requested no tomatoes on my salad, they were mixed in. I would have sent it back but it took a while to get our meal to begin with. Then they forgot my salad dressing. My burger on top was too rare so I ate around it. We also ordered a basket of fries for the tavle, not sure how fresh they were. Sad experience and I was embarrassed since I had originally raved to my dining companions.  It's such a shame since it is such a great concept and they offer a gluten-free menu. Not sure I will give them another try. Too bad."}
{"text":"The owners, Steven Tyler and Mick Jagger, sure know what they're doing when they make a burger!  The burgers here are great!  There aren't many burger joints that manage such a perfectly cooked and dressed burger.  So good!  The prices are what you'd expect to pay in Ballantyne... and not what you'd expect to pay at burger joints outside of the area.  There is an abundance of sauces to put on your burger or dip your fries in.  Very nice!   Try:  Dipping your sweet potato fries into their marshmallow dip  Avoid:  Unhinging your jaw to fit that burger in your mouth"}
{"text":"This was formerly the Qdoba across the street from Chipotle on McKnight Rd. We received a card at our office building for a \"free dinner\".  Apparently it was the \"last hurrah\" training session for the employees prior to the grand opening. This restaurant seems similar to Burgatory and BRGR:  gourmet burgers. Everything on the menu is a la carte. Burgers start at about $6.50 and go up from there. Fries about $2.50. Drinks and shakes $2.50 - $4.00. The burgers were a bit on the rare side for my taste.  Good, though, and served on a brioche bun.  Maybe when they open for real you can specify your desired level of doneness? The fries were good, albeit \"average\". The shakes were great. If we had been paying customers, our bill for 2 burgers, 2 sides, and 2 shakes would have been about $28.00."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! The service was great, very accommodating. They added turkey chili to my husband's burger free of charge. I had the veggie Greek with feta, roasted red peppers, cucumbers, lettuce & tomato....delish! Sweet potato fries were really good and a large variety of dipping sauces. Good selection of craft beers & fresh milkshakes as well. The menu also includes salads, chicken, hot dogs,  shrimp & Ahi burgers. Great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Very unique format for a burger joint, you order what you want when you first walk in, take a number and seat yourself at an open table or the milkshake bar. They bring it out to you, you go to the sauce bar and pick out one of the several sauces to choose from. One of my recomended favs is the roasted marshmallow sauce to go with the sweet potato fries.  The chicken basket i ordered was decent. Chicken seemed fresh but had some tough fat in it that i pulled out of the breading. Burgers look good too. Milkshakes are where its at though. Id recomend this place for people looking to go sit and chat over a shake.  Please is very clean, although you dont see the kitchen from the seating area, milkshakes are made fresh at the bar. Interesting layout but comfortable.  Most notable is the hand washing station at the sauce and drink bar."}
{"text":"This is WAY better then the competition (smash burger)!!! They got 5 stars just for customer service alone. Everyone there was so helpful and seemed to be such a great mood. I ordered the sliders, which come on Hawaiian roles, which sold me. I also was lucky enough to get a key lime pie shake, which was thick and delicious. The food was perfect, service was perfect, and the place was VERY clean.   So glad I work around the corner!!!"}
{"text":"The last time I went to burger 21 the restaurant was filthy.  The chairs have food ground into them and the floor has food smeared all over the place under the tables. Now here is where it gets gross.  When I wiped down the table with an alcohol wipe, my wipe turned black.  That has to be months of buildup because you don't just have complete filth everywhere from one day.  Not coming back until they clean up the restaurant."}
{"text":"Burger 21 was a great place to eat. I took my family and the service was good for counter service. The food came out really fast and the burgers had a great flavor. The fires were also really good and they have all finds of sauces for the fries it is a must try."}
{"text":"Good sized GF menu with lots of burger, salad, fry, and milkshake options. The server was super helpful and explained their process along the way and how they kept my French Fries separate. The most exciting part is they have GF Buns!! The bun was very good, not too dry or crumbly. The burger and fries were very good, and I'm not usually a fan of burgers. Their fry dipping sauces are very clearly labeled, and they made sure to clarify on the GF milkshake. My husband had a chicken sandwich and really like it. I will definitely go back. On a side note, the decor and setup of the place is really cool!"}
{"text":"This \"fast food\" burger did not taste like fast food.  I had the gruyere burger, and it tasted very lean and fresh, not greasy or gross at all.  The restaurant was clean and the staff were nice.  My only complaint is that the fries looked and tasted like an exact copy of McDonalds' famous fries, and don't get me wrong, they were still delicious.  Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Very good burger at a very good price. Went on a Monday night and had the bacon cheeseburger with a mix of regular and sweet potato fries for $7. Not a huge beer selection but a couple of decent local brews. Kind of a fast food setting, you order at the counter and they bring it out to you. If you want a second beer you have to get back in line. Again, not a gourmet burger but pretty darn good."}
{"text":"They have the best chicken tenders in town. The fries both potato and sweet potato are excellent."}
{"text":"The place is great. The atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty nice, and the menu has many options. But the burger doesn't come with fries. They have a great sauce bar. They provide many unique sauces. they don't have the best burger, but I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Burger 21's mission statement is to deliver chef-created taste without the chef price and according to the guys at the Charlotte Burger Blog the burgers are \"Excellent\". The menu is comprised of 21 chef created Certified Angus burgers and the vegetarian, chicken, seafood and turkey burgers are all hormone free. Burger 21 has a gluten-free menu featuring gluten-free Angus beef burgers on French Meadow Bakery gluten-free buns, along with gluten-free shakes, salads and fries. Most of the burgers come equipped with a toasted brioche bun and for the most part sound pretty delicious.  With all of great menu items and rave reviews you might be surprised (or maybe not) that I gave them a fail rating... but I did.  We checked out the Cheese & Ale Fries topped with bacon & scallions but thought they were nothing more than McDonalds fries with a side of cheap cheese sauce and .25 ounce of chewy bacon chunks. The Bacon Cheesy came with lettuce, tomato, red onion, applewood-smoked bacon, and our choice of American, Cheddar or Swiss cheese, on a toasted brioche bun. Besides the delicious brioche bun the Bacon Cheesy is your average uninspiring bacon cheeseburger with no more personality than any of its predecessors.   The Philly Cheese came with grilled peppers and onions, provolone and white American cheese, a dijon chive mayo on a toasted brioche bun. All of that sounded amazing... but it wasn't. Instead it was overwhelmingly greasy, messy, and all together a waste of time. The Chocolate Peanut Butter Milk Shake was too Chocolatey for me and too Peanut Buttery for Ella, so I guess you could say it has the perfect balance.  I find way too many fancy dishes with a lack of personality being dressed up with truffles or truffle oil and at Burger 21 I felt like that was the role of the toasted brioche bun. The meat had no density, the Angus Beef burgers were uninspiring and without the brioche bun nothing worth writing about. If you're in the Ballantyne area go to Five Guys, if you're on Park Rd go to NomNom, and if you really want to try a chef inspired burger that will make your eyes roll to the back of your head... go to Toast Cafe."}
{"text":"Just okay for me.  Burger doesn't have a ton of flavor so adding sauces to it seems to help some.  I added bacon which gave my burger the most flavor.  Now that I think about it I had mushrooms on my burger so that was uneventful.  Had the ability to be good so mess around with the burger patties and you might have a winner.  Staff was very helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"Usually I write reviews wondering why a restaurant is rated so highly... This is one of the rare times when I feel the rating should be a bit higher.  Not a lot more- 4 stars instead of 3.5.  But still...  Great burgers!  Tasty and unique!"}
{"text":"My husband and I grabbed a late dinner here last night and couldn't have been happier!  I ordered the black & bleu burger and he got the philly cheesesteak one.  I also had the chocolate peanut butter shake and we split a basket of the half & half fries (1/2 - regular & 1/2 - sweet potato).  My burger was amazing! It was topped with bleu cheese, bacon, fresh lettuce & some kind of delicious sauce.  My husband loved his burger, too! And the milkshake was simply amazing - it was the perfect consistency & flavor.  The fries were delicious as well.    The staff is all so friendly and helpful.  They have a ton of really good burger combos/choices on the menu or you can build your own if you don't like their combos.  The also have a decent selection of milkshakes and different fries & fry toppings!  Also! there are 10-15 different sauces to choose from to dip fries in besides ketchup.  This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Been a fan of Burger 21 since we first tried them.  Father's Day, we didn't want to go out but Dad wanted a burger... we called in the order, were told it would be ready in 10 minutes!  The kids drove over to pick up.   Great Burgers.  We did Bacon Cheeseburgers all around (4 of us) and the 1 lb. order of fries (perfect amount for 4 people!)  All Burgers cooked the way they were requested, and all condiments on the side which was also a great idea.  Like I said, we love this place, just never ordered take out before !   So far it's the best burger in Chandler.   Try it !!!"}
{"text":"Pros:   - Best chicken tenders I have ever had. Hands down!  They just melt in your mouth. - They offer sweet potato fries. - The shakes are delicious.  Cons: - Regular French fries are not fresh cut.  I'm kind of a stickler for this at places that are burger joints. Take the extra time to make an awesome fry! - Condiments are plentiful, but none are fresh or homemade. Again, the devil is in the details. If they took the time to make their own honey mustard, ranch, etc. it would move Burger 21 from good to gotta have!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great menu, nice place! The ONLY reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it is FREEZING in here ALL THE TIME!! Turn down the air conditioning!"}
{"text":"Let's just say this place is perfection. Burgers are well made and cooked to perfection. Do not skip out on the fries and milkshake because you'll regret it. The bacon and ales 1lb fries are delicious and more than enough for 2 people. The food in general is kinda pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"I wasn't very fond on the name and also yet another burger joint doesn't sound that appealing but I gave this place a try and it was worth it!  The fires were delicious and the cheese burger was pretty tasteful as well.   The service was OK but hey, it's a casual joint.  The shake menu looks amazing but my belt couldn't afford such crime. I'll have to be really good with my diet in order to allow me to do it but sounds pretty tempting.  Great addition to the neighborhood.   Cheers"}
{"text":"It fails to amaze me how crappy service can be...  How difficult is it to remember to put the gluten free bun ON THE SIDE and to ADD fries to the order?  I mean really....  I guess it's my fault because I didn't look on the bag...  I'll make sure to do that if I ever return."}
{"text":"From the custom made burgers, the numerous chicken finger options and the thick delicious shakes, this place has exactly what you want when you're  in the mood for that \"burger, fries and a coke\" combo. Be sure to know what you want before approaching the counter because there are numerous options to select from the menu and the expansive dipping sauce counter. One last thing, the fries are simple, crisp and  hot. Enough said."}
{"text":"Eh...not impressed. Over priced for just average burgers. Went with my husband & 2 kids age 10 & 7. Wasn't impressed with the chicken as it is not a whole breast of chicken but ground chicken. French fries had a weird after taste and were overly-thin. Probably won't go back, unless I get a gift certificate."}
{"text":"I imagine this place is what you'd get if Noodles & Company had Five Guys' baby. I think it's going for fast casual, although lacking on the fast and a bit too pricey for what it is--although I will say my burger was very tasty.  Problem #1 - You order at the counter as soon as you walk in the door, but you don't get to see a menu in advance. Confusion is not a good way to start your experience.  Problem #2 - After you figure out there's a paper menu on the counter, step aside to review it, and go back to to place your order, you pay and are given a receipt to write in a tip and sign. What exactly are you tipping for? You haven't even received your food to know if your order is right.  I guess because I didn't leave a pre-mature tip, I didn't get a thank you or an order number. So I assumed I seat myself, got my drink at the fountain, and slid into a booth.  After waiting for a good 10 minutes or so, someone comes out with my food--not sure what table it goes to because I don't have a number.  Okay, even though I ordered at the counter and got my own drink, someone did bring my food to the table. Seeing that there are no garbage cans, I assume someone will bus my table too. However, Noodles & Co and Boston Market do the same and have never asked for a tip. So I'm still a bit miffed.  Overall, it was a clean, nice casual atmosphere. My burger was tasty, but on the small side (about the size of a McD's cheeseburger, but thicker and juicier). Shoestring fries were fine, but nothing special. So I don't regret trying it, but I won't be in a hurry to go back either."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch with some co-workers. We were greeted promptly and there wasn't a line (order and get a number). I had a few questions since it was my first time. I decided on the Greek veggie burger (I'm not a big beef eater). Burger doesn't come with fries or a drink. I decided on the sweet potato fries and the cashier said most of their sauces are homemade and the toasted marshmallow sauce goes great with the sweet potato fries. And yes, it was delicious!!! Like so so good.  Burger was good. I thought the bun it's self was too thick and definitely more bread than burger when I took a bite. But the veggies were fresh and cut a little thicker. A friend at the table had a shake and it looked yummy, so I'll have to stop back for one!"}
{"text":"We visited Burger 21 for the first time this past weekend. The service was outstanding. One of the owners happened to be working and welcomed us and explained the menu. We walked up to order, got 2 burgers (Mediterranean toppings on a beer burger and Tex-Mex Haystack), fries, ale cheese dip and an espresso shake (which comes with chocolate covered espresso beans). The woman checking us out was very friendly, attentive and helpful. After ordering we picked out a few sauces (including marshmallow, which was actually delicious with fries) and picked our table. We only waited a few minutes for our delicious food. The burgers were cooked exactly as requested. Buns were delicious as well. Throughout eating our waters were refilled multiple times. I was extremely impressed with the quality of the food and excellent service for a good price. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great burgers....4 star because they are very salty. You don't need salt to cover up the beef flavor people! Fries are great and crispy but again overly salted. Can't go wrong with having a beer either....you are going to need it with all the salt."}
{"text":"Was going to eat dinner later but wanted a snack now.  Decided to just try a Creme Brûlée shake.  The shake doesn't have the crunchy \"brûlée\" pieces that Zinburger has (nor any eggy custard-like flavor), and just tastes like a plain caramel shake with a squiggle of caramel sauce on top.  It's still good, but not at the same level of Zinburger's by any means, and probably slightly below SmashBurger's Salted Caramel shake (though it's larger).  I wish they had the option to order a smaller size, as that much blended soft serve (not hand-scooped ice cream) didn't sit well with me.  The Rrstaurant is modern, clean, and definitely fits the Chipotle fast casual mold.  I would come back to try out their food, but would not come back for dessert or a treat.  It's definitely a massive improvement over the always-empty Qdoba that had this space before."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times before and had no problems, so I was confident that this time would be similar to the others. I was definitely wrong. When I went, it was around 45 minutes until they closed, so there was still plenty of time to order and get out in a reasonable amount of time. I never mind the waiting time, so that wasn't a problem. When I got my burger it was about 15 minutes until they closed and I needed to be home, so I headed back. When I got home and opened the burger, the center was bright red, NOT the \"warm, pink center\" that they are famous for. It was RARE. Went in the next business day to get my money back, because by the time I would have gone back the night before it would have been closed. I talked with the manager on duty, who was different than the one I had spoken to on the phone the night before. This one seriously sat there and stared at the receipt like it was some damn foreign language and then preceded to tell me that my rare burger was not rare, even though I had pictures of the BRIGHT RED center to prove it. Then she goes on to complain that I should have come in the night before so it would have been \"easier for her and the restaurant\"...okay kind of just told you my situation and why I am in today and couldn't come the night before. This is after telling her twice already! I seriously spent 15 minutes arguing with a half-wit \"manager\" about getting my money back. Didn't think it was that difficult, but I guess for Burger 21 it was. Never going back here again."}
{"text":"I've only been once but it was a good experience! Very family friendly..we went around 6pm on a weeknight and it wasn't too crowded. They have lots of options and a cheap kids menu. My husband and I tried the ahi tuna burger and the Thai shrimp burger which were both yummy and my daughter ate almost every one of the sauces (they have a huge selection you can pump out yourself). We loved the apple cider sauce with sweet potato fries. :-) the company that owns burger 21 is also the same as mellow mushroom and the eclectic menu is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Went in with low expectations and came out pretty happy. Only negative is the ordering process. You walk in right to the register where there isn't a large menu visible. So you wait in line for your turn in the spotlight and the pressure is on to order. My suggestion is add a flat screen or two with the menu so i can avoid the entry clusterf#ck.   Ale cheese fries were really good. Worth the trip for them alone.   Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was one of the lucky people to enjoy Burger 21 on their opening day 7/21! The options are endless and they have something for everyone. Juicy burgers? yep. Chicken burgers? yep. SEAFOOD burgers? YEP! Salads, dogs and shakes also have real estate on the menu. I decided to try something different so I went with the Spicy Thai Shrimp burger, lightly-fried (not greasy) shrimp burger, lettuce, tomato, sriracha aïoli, sesame Thai slaw, pure sriracha, toasted sesame bun.  This thing was ridiculously good. Great amount of heat and big chucks of shrimp in the patty. I also ordered some fries (do not come with your burger). There is a sauce bar with about 10 options, some are very interesting. Toasted Marshmallow  and apple cider sauces for sweet potato fries. My favorite was the Thai Ketchup on the regular fries, but everything was good. The service was great and the prices are very fair. My office is close so I will be back often, much to the dismay of my diet plans...Welcome to Scottsdale Burger 21!"}
{"text":"First timer here. And I'm impressed enough to return. Because I am now addicted to their milkshake. I don't get a hankering for a shake often...but when it arises...you need to appease that craving.  The brother ordered the chicken Parmesan and was blown away. He practically inhaled it. With a cookies and creme milkshake. Pretty standard as Oreo shakes come.   I got the skinny since I was indulging in the creme brûlée milkshake. And that was the best life decision I made all weekend. The sammich was a mediocre turkey burger with a dry bun. Good by turkey burger standards though.   Atmosphere: it's cute, looks clean but it's small and it is a frozen trundra. I saw a penguin and a polar bear a few tables over.  Kinda pricey for a burger joint but worth a little indulgence for a shake that's far better than jack in the box."}
{"text":"Unfortunately all the different sauces in the world cannot save a flavorless, overcooked patty.  I really like the decor and feel of this burger joint. The fries were great. The selection of sauces is second to none.  We tried the two southwestern style burgers. The brioche bun was far better than the sesame seed. The patties were boring. The meat was well done and just didn't bring anything to the table. On to the next burger joint..."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after seeing a review on here.  We had not heard of Burger 21, but decided let's give it a go because we are a little mad with another burger joint and their recent changes.  I was excited to try some of their burgers as they had quite a few different options and what looked like fun burgers.  I tried the Philly Burger and Kevin had some mexican burger, can't recall the name, but it had salsa, guac, etc. on it.  The burgers came out a little on the cold side, and they lacked flavor.  They are nice thick burger, but they were too greasy and dripped way too much for my liking.  I'm glad we had a coupon as they are on the pricier side compared to other burger joints.  Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Because I wanted to like this place I attempted again. Speed was better. But i am sick as sick can be. My meat was not med well but don't think that was it. Gluten-Free, don't think so!"}
{"text":"Really good , loved all the dips , my kids scarfed the chicken tenders down :) wish we would of found this place before we move ."}
{"text":"went this weekend after someone recommended it. Very good! We enjoyed the black and bleu sliders with sweet potato fries. I liked that the fries were very thin. Their milkshakes are amazing. My kids had the chocolate peanut butter and malted milk ball and they LOVED them. The staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch on Black Friday. The cashier and servers aren't the friendliest people on the planet but seeing as they have to work today I guess I can't really blame them.  The place has a hand washing station by the napkins which is nice! On to the food! A lot of unique burgers. They have a gluten free menu as well.  I got the Thai spicy burger and it was delicious!!! They have a lot of sauces to choose from in their ketchup bar. We also got fries which were good. They have bottles of beer and small bottles of wine here too if you want one. It's a solid place for lunch or dinner. I just wish that the people working here were a little more approachable /friendly. Over all pretty good place though :)"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this creative restaurant! I had the Sonoma valley salad with grilled chicken and my brother had the monthly special, the turducken burger on a pretzel bun. Both were great. Service was excellent. I like the many different sauces to choose from. The fries left something to be desired, won't get those again, but I'll probably be back to get a cookie sundae."}
{"text":"I dare you to try to find the shrimp taste in the shrimp burger. There is no flavor at all (of any kind) in the shrimp burger. Half way through my tasteless shrimp burger, I ordered a bacon cheese burger that was generic. Not bad not great.  The fries were excellent. Some of the best I've come across in years!"}
{"text":"Really consistent, great quality. For a franchise this is a great burger. Tried the loaded spud well worth it. If you're a burger person this place warrants a visit for sure. Fries are good but nothing amazing although the sauce bar is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Tasty burgers and Fries to say the least. I especially appreciate the fact that there are veggie and seafood burgers on the menu which isn't standard at burger joints.  I had the shrimp burger which was medium on flavor but very much edible and appreciated. It's not often that I go to enjoy lunch or even dinner for that matter out with my family at a place like this on the go because burger spots don't have enough variety for the non burger consumer.  My husband had the burger special since it was a feature burger. It was a turkey burger with a layer of grilled shrimp and some amazing avocado sauce. He enjoyed his burger very much. We ordered fries to split, they were sweet potato fries which we were very impressed with. The sweet potato fries were the highlight item for us as they were perfectly crispy. Many times you get sweet potato fries that are soft and lack crisp and flavor. These were perfect ;-) The cost was a bit much for the one order if fries as well as the burgers. I'm sure we will be back, we will try w shake next time."}
{"text":"I've been to Burger 21 twice now for dinner in the past week.  I guess it's safe to say that I love it.  Five Guys?  Meh.  Give Burger 21 a try.  When you first walk in, you grab a paper menu and study it intensely.  There are so many choices that I think they need a better system so the doorway doesn't get clogged, but maybe that's just me because everything sounds so good that it's hard to narrow my selection down to just one.  You order and pay at the counter.  Now, here's the part I don't really like:  on your charge slip you're given to sign, there's an OBVIOUS place there for gratuity.  I can either (a) leave a tip at a \"fast food\" restaurant in advance, hoping I get what I paid for or (b) not leave a tip and look like a total dork and run the risk of my food being tainted.  Can I just say how much I hate the expectation of a tip at anything other than a full-service restaurant?  If you're making more than $2/hour like a server does, then you're already getting paid to do your job!!!    Okay, I'll get off my soapbox about that ridiculousness and, yes, I have left gratuity both times in advance I've dined there this week, most likely so I didn't look like a big d-bag at the counter.    The decor inside is fresh and modern.  The outside patio offers a lot of seating to enjoy the nice summer weather (there's even an awning over it in case of rain/heat/what-have-you).   While you're waiting for someone to bring out your food to you, you can stock up on a variety of dips from their condiment bar.  They have so many unique offerings.  By far, my favorite is the Ragin' Cajun to dip my french fries in, although I have trouble distinguishing between the Ragin Cajun and the Chipotle Mayo.   I'm not a big fan of ketchup, but I tried the Thai Ketchup, hoping it would be something special and tangy that didn't resemble ketchup.  Nope.  It tasted like regular ketchup to me.  I thought the Apple Cider was going to be a vinegar for my fries, but it ended up being a creamy dip.  It was good, but tasted almost like Honey Mustard to me.    The first night we dined there, I tried the Mediterranean Chicken Burger.  It was really tasty, but probably could have used more of everything on top, especially feta cheese and grilled red peppers.  We shared a big basket of \"Cheese & Ale Fries topped with bacon & scallions.\"  It's really a basket of fries (plenty to share) with a cup of hot soupy beer cheese with bacon and scallions mixed in.   It was good, but after discovering the condiment bar with its multitude of free sauces, you don't really need the cheese.  Maybe if it was melted over a mound of fries it would make more sense.    The second night this week we visited, I opted for a regular beef burger, and went with the Philly Cheese burger.  Wow--GOOD CHOICE.  It was cooked to my liking, very juicy, and the beef was extremely flavorful and well-seasoned.  Combine that with the gooey cheese and pepper and onions, and I was more than satisfied.  It was definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had.    Obviously, I'm going back.  The only question is...when?"}
{"text":"Chandler store:  We were more than impressed with both the food and service! I called with a take out order on their Family and Friends training day (I thought they were already open); their grand opening is tomorrow. The manager was exceptionally professional and friendly, he took my order and then informed me about their training day and graciously agreed to fill our order even though they weren't officially open - it was such a welcoming conversation. And the food! It was amazing! The chicken tender breading was crazy good. The bacon cheesy sliders were delicious, they taste like steak and are cooked to perfection. Portion sizes are pretty huge, you can easily share. We would highly recommend this new burger joint!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, usually getting the turkey burger and customizing it to my liking. I have always been completely satisfied as the ingredients taste fresh and delicious. Love their sweet potato fries and love how they have all of their many condiments out for you to take as much of as you wish. Never eaten in, but it seems like a cute litte place to grab some quick food. Oh, and they always have a smile on their face, great service."}
{"text":"Really good burgers!! Good toppings and the chicken burgers are good too! Lots of sauces for dipping, cool little spot. Little pricey but def worth a go!!"}
{"text":"\"It's like a fast food restaurant without all of the things like cheap prices and quick service that make fast food restaurants good.\" - Me  Ordering: When you go in, there's no big board with pictures of the menu. You have to grab a paper menu, lean on something or sit down somewhere, then go back and order. Very strange. I imagine this will lead to long waiting times to order during busier times.They then take a long time to bring the food.  The prices: This place is EXPENSIVE. We ordered 2 burgers, 1 hotdog, 1 drink and fries. Total - $33.00. Are you kidding me? We could have bought 10 burgers and 5 large fries at McDonalds across the street.  Portions: The new Pittsburgh hipster culture likes small portions for big prices. I'm the opposite. I like to pay less and get more. The portions are really small. Their 1lb basket of fries is basically 2 medium fries at McDonald's. The burgers are also very small. Not fat and not wide, just little hockey pucks. I'm not even sure if it's bigger than McDonald's. The bread takes up most of the burger and the hot dog. If you want just enough to get by, this is your place. If you want to be filled, go somewhere else.  The food: The fries are Mcdonald's fries with less taste and grease, but were the best part of the meal. The bacon cheese fries don't have real cheese. It's like a big goop of jelly like cheese. It's not tasty and we ended up not using it. The burger was burnt unfortunately. It was small and tasted okay, but not worth the $10 I paid for it. The hotdog had right out of the can chili on it which wasn't very good and is not chili for hot dogs. The hotdogs are all beef and have a funny taste to them with the chili. It's also worth noting that they consier fries an appetizer there. So you get your fries first and by the time your burger comes, you don't have any left and don't want your burger with their slow service.  The sauces:  Some people really like the thai ketchup and marshmallow sauce they have. The thai ketchup tastes like overly sweet ketchup with some vinegar, spices and asian flavor and it leaves a foul taste in your mouth. I can still taste the marshmallow sauce 4 days later and it's even worse. Just imagine liquid marshmallow sauce with some sour stuff thrown in. The regular ketchup is also not Heinz ketchup and is too sweet.  Overall thoughts: If you aren't a hipster, this place isn't for you. It's expensive, the portions are small, they are slow and ordering was completely nonsensical.  Would I go back? NO. I'll go to the North Park Longue and spend the same and get much more instead."}
{"text":"Great fast food that tastes like home cooking! We like this burger haven for their great customer service and fantastic burgers. I love their tuna burger--chili aioli sauce that's just a little spicy, avocado, tuna just perfectly cooked, pickles--sweet & savory bliss! The awesome sweet potato fries are delicious too. You can also have half/half fries. Orders are big enough to share or claim your own if hungry. I have tried their beers, okay limited selection. Great service from the staff! Our party has a food allergy & they were super helpful."}
{"text":"Pricey. 1 burger, 3 sliders, large fries , cheese & ale sauce, 2 drinks $30 Cashier training rang up basket of cheese & ale fries as just a sauce. Manager was kind to bring more fries when order came out. Black and blue sliders very tasty, juicy but small. And $8.49 not sure about worth the price. They do have tons of great dipping sauces around the corner ...toasted marshmallow! Of course this is 2nd visit, will come back."}
{"text":"I went to burger 21 yesterday and this Mickey Mouse company was just horrible! I order a bacon cheesy(the cheese tasted like card board) burger with fries (which was expensive). I got my food VERY late! And only reason why I kept my cool was because my friends told me it was good, and I finally got my food... It tasted like feces wrapped in expensive toast!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Burgers....we tried this new restaurant last night and were pleasantly surprised. The greeting staff at the front door were friendly and explained their concept. You order at their station, pay and receive a number to display at your table, of your choice. The decor is inviting and fresh, offering both tables and booths. We had ordered the cheese burger and the mushroom burger. We were told they are prepared med-well unless we wanted them differently. We both ordered them med-rare. We also ordered a basket of regular fries. The fries arrived first to the table, hot and fresh. A couple of minutes later the burgers followed. The burgers arrived prepared as ordered, med-rare. They are extremely juicy and fresh. They use a nice bun that held up well to the burger. The staff returned to see if there was anything else we needed, a nice touch. They have a large selection of self-serve sauces to add to your burger or for your fries. The prices are very good, and, the burgers excellent. The staff is friendly, well-trained and knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend this burger..."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best burger places I have ever been. The burgers are juicy and flavorful plus they always come out perfectly cooked. Never trust someone who thinks Five Guys burgers are good. Burger 21 is where it's at!!  The skinny fries are awesome and we love the thai ketchup. So glad this joint is within walking distance of our house!"}
{"text":"I tried this place and was really put off by the layout. It was difficult to order since the menu is not posted anywhere. You need to wait in line to get the menu. While you try to decide, the employees and fellow customers glare at you. I tried the Greek burger and fries. It was not too busy but I had to wait 35 minutes for my food. It was a little confusing to find a place to wait. I was told that I was not allowed to sit at a table since my order was to-go. I did like the variety of condiments available.   I was not super happy with the quality of the food when I got home. Although the Greek burger is veggie, I found it to be very greasy. It also was a huge mess to eat. The fries were very warm but also very greasy- old grease at that. I am not the best cook, but I think I can make a better veggie burger and save 35 minutes of my time."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the burger. Cooked perfectly. Like my burger medium to medium rare. Rarely cooked correctly. Mine was perfect. Enjoyed the flavor of the beef. Sauce bar was a hit. So many flavors. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Just waited 30 minutes for my take out order after telling them on the phone I was just down the street AND paying for the meal in the store because they \"didn't know I was there\" Food is ice cold. No offer to comp meal. I'm done here."}
{"text":"Came here one day for lunch with a group of co-workers. Same mall as Fired Pie, Starbucks, Paradise Bakery, Panda Express, and Whole Foods so there's ample parking even if you have to walk a little. It's in the former space where there once was a Qdoba. We all ordered one at a time down the path that takes you from the cashier around to where the fountain drinks and sauces and napkins and utensils are. This area is a real cluster if you want either refills or you forgot to grab something the first time around because when it gets busy like when we were there, there's a whole caravan of folks to contend with coming straight at you from the cashier. You can either be polite and patient and wait for them to pass or just force your way in and quickly grab whatever you need. So we grabbed what we needed and waited for our orders. Menu offerings reminded me a bit of this place in Vegas called I Love Burgers - which was about as pricey as well. While we waited I tried a number of sauces in little cups while my co-workers watched and shook their heads - Thai Ketchup (meh), Apple Cider mayo (not bad), and Chipotle mayo (also not bad). I got the shrimp burger but had to first flag down the waitress who was running around from table to table asking if anyone ordered the shrimp burger - delivery system needs a little tweaking there. I also got the fries and a fountain drink. Shrimp burger was pretty decent. Wish I could say the same for the fries but I had a few and ended up giving the rest to my co-workers. So the burger, fries, and drink all together ran me about 15 bucks. We all agreed it was rather pricey for what you get. Considering this, I think it's safe to say it's highly unlikely we'll be back. When we yell out choices for lunch, this place never seems to come up."}
{"text":"So many awesome menu options! They have so many healthy options if you chose! I also love all their condiments! The restaurant is really clean and bright as well. They also got my special request just right."}
{"text":"The amount of options here is a welcome change from normal, run of the mill burger joints. The beef burgers are amazing, juicy, cooked to order, with a wide range of toppings to suit anyone's taste. The chicken and sea food options are well rounded and always a good choice if red meat isn't what you're craving. The fries are amazing and you can order them half and half with both regular fries and sweet potato fries. The sauce bar has quite a few option for dunking fries, chicken tenders, or adding just a bit more oomph to your sandwich. All in all one of my new favorite places to grab a burger with friends."}
{"text":"I tried the Cheesy burger, it had pieces of something hard inside, almost cracked my tooth on two different bites.  Also, the lettuce was not fresh and the both the lettuce and tomato were hot.  I wish the cashier would have told me about the burger of the month which I spotted after I ordered, that may have been a better experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Ahi tuna burger with tomatoes, cucumber lettuce, Siracha aioli, caramel soy sauce, avocado on a cute sesame toasted bun for $10. Perfectly shaped as if you didn't want to eat the nice presentation! Ordered regular sweet potato fries for $3.  Prepay at the register. Grab a number. Find a table and wait for order to come to your table. Pleasantly surprised with the taste of this combo. They even had about 10 different kinds of sauces such as Thai ketchup and chipotle mayo. Variety is key!! Inside seating was blasting cold air. Too cold for me. Optional outside seating was great for some fresh air for this time of year.  The only horrific experience was when I left I ran my hand through my hair while driving to my next destination, and something weird was in my hair. Some crustationlike texture. Then some legs of some sort. And then as I was driving I see some weird bug!!!! Ughhhhh!! Screamed and drove to the nearest parking area as the bug ended up crawling from my waist seatbelt. Parked and ran out of the car and brushed that creepy weird looking bug off of me!! What a relief. Outside seating gave me an unwanted friend.  Lol....despite that bug scare (meant for a bug's adventure elsewhere), I did enjoy the presentation of the burger and fries and loved the taste. Will be back soon to try more and the shakes."}
{"text":"Very good burger, but very overpriced, especially when you add in the sides. If you have a little more time and want something better than the fast food burgers, then you may enjoy this. At these prices, we'd rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tried Burger21 today for lunch and yum....so much better than a couple of other mid to high end buger places...nice location good service....I will be back..."}
{"text":"Burger was good, not great. Sweet potato fries weren't as good as you could get at grocery store and cook yourself. Sauces were outstanding with lots of variety! For almost twenty bucks for lunch, it was lacking."}
{"text":"Oh my...yes, please. The food here is absolutely fantastic. There can be a bit of a wait sometimes, but it is still by far one of the best burger places I've found anywhere nearby."}
{"text":"We had a cheeseburger (which was awesome/ juicy and flavorful) and a buffalo chicken sandwich. Beware: their chicken is not a chicken breast but a patty :( It still did taste ok but it was disappointing that it wasn't real meat; I wouldn't get this entree again. Sweet potato fries were typical but tasty. Service was fast and friendly. Worth coming back."}
{"text":"Food was decent. However this is the most overpriced burger in town. $7.99 burger. Fries and drink brought total to $12.77 before tax.   Plenty of other burger establishments where you get more value for same or better quality food."}
{"text":"Tried to post a photo but can't figure out how.  We ordered two chili cheese dogs. You would expect that to be smothered in chili, right?  Um, nope.  I think I count 5 beans/meat total!  Called the manager as it was take out and she said \"what would you like me to do\"?  Oh, I don't know, offer a gift card for the value or something.  Epic failure!"}
{"text":"MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR NEW BALLANTYNE CARD! I went into today and presented my old ballantyne card and the CSR said she couldn't give the discount because I don't have the card on me. I walked out. All over 15%. Poor customer service. I've been a customer since day one and customer service levels have progressively deteriorated. You've lost a loyal customer. I would recommend added training for customer service."}
{"text":"Order at front desk and sit down then they bring your food type deal. Clean and modern setting, good service had someone asking if everything was good about every 5 mins, lol.  I tried the black and blue, good burger but needed more flavor. Blue cheese was very mild and bacon was cooked ok. Bun was good could have been a bit softer.  The sweet potato fries were the shoestring style, good overall.  The fun part was the condiments bar. Diff types mayo, mustard and ketchup. Weird one was toasted marshmallow which actually went very well with the sweet potato fries (think thanksgiving). Thai ketchup and Cajun where the standouts.  Overall good place but the price of over  $11 for burger/fries is a little steep and makes you expect higher quality food."}
{"text":"I would start by saying I had high expectations. I will also say they deserve some grace as the place just opened but they did make 4 of our 5 burgers wrong. Funny detail my 'shroom burger had 1 slice of mushroom on it. They did offer to remake the burgers but I just couldn't see throwing out all of that food.  As for the food. Pretty good burgers, juicy, good bun. reminded me of an old fashioned hamburger that you rolled yourself at home. But certainly not worth the price. Excellent fries, very crispy with choice of sauce. But again not sure about the $6 basket.   The decor and atmosphere is trendy and very \"San Fransisco\".    Overall I would have to say go across the 101 to Culver's. Though Culver's a much more conservative atmosphere, you will certainly have a better burger, better service and save 30% on your bill. If it makes you feel better donate the 30% you saved to the charity of your choice."}
{"text":"Came back and let them know they shorted us the bacon. Too bad so sad nothing we can do about it. If you called when it happened maybe but it's your fault we were closed when you figured it out.   Run by a bunch of kids who can't make a management decision.   Check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"Love the burgers.  You really go to heaven with this tasty treat and I don't usually gush over hamburgers.  The fries weren't stellar.  And the price of the burger is higher than I would normally pay.  So we have decided to forego the side, get the sandwich to go and eat a salad or chips from home for future visits."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Nice location, clean...2 stars...  Ordered medium patty but got well done. Didn't feel like waiting again for another burger since I was eating lunch with friends. You had one chance but it failed. Bummer man. For an $8 burger, it should be a bit more custom. Pay attention to details cooks!"}
{"text":"Trust me, I didn't take pictures this time because I gobbled up my ginormous burger, crispy fries, and sweet pumpkin shake in a split second. The sauce bar was particularly yummy, with it's smores sauce (tastes just like marshmallows), thai ketchup sauce (like nice spicy tang heinz), and many many other flavors I wish I had more stomach room to try out.   There's even a sink by the sauce sink if you wish to wash your hands after getting them messy. The only downside? It's kinda pricey and it's all a la carte, there are no meal deals, you pick and choose every last detail. But everything is very clean and well-maintained.  I wish they kept to-go containers out near the utensils (where it's accessible) because I wasn't able to finish my food, and I waited quite a while after I asked one on the workers to please get me one. Otherwise, pretty easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"It saddens me to leave a negative comment for burger 21 because the food is always so good. but this is the second time a received a milkshake and this is where it was filled to. the first time i let it slide because i was on my lunch break and i was in a hurry, but the second time i asked if this was normal and i was told \"the ice cream was weighed.\" i would personally never serve anyone a shake filled like this. i am basically paying for a regular shake but being served a small. instead of the manager immediately remaking my shake he went back and fourth with me about weighing the ice cream and tried comparing my shake to the other 2 i had purchased. the shake i received and the customer service approach was below par."}
{"text":"Service: pretty good. Young kids working, so it's the service you'd expect at a fast food place.   Cleanliness: all the tables were biased when we came in. Restaurant has a modern vibe to it. Very crisp and clean. We sat outside to eat. They have metal tables, probably not the best decision in Arizona.   Food. It's okay. It was bad. It was \"omg good\" it was simply, okay. No better way to put it. Probably not good enough to return, but not bad enough that I wouldn't recommend to someone. Burgers were greasy (as you'd expect) and fresh and hot when we got them. Fries were excellent. The sauce bar is a nice touch. Another Yelp review mentioned sweet potatoes and the toasted marshmallow sauce - excellent."}
{"text":"I REALLY dislike the tipping, and tipping before you get your food no less.  It is not a full service restaurant.  It is more like Hardee's.  Great burgers, excellent cheese sauce and condiments.  I enjoy eating there and I begrudgingly tip, but it would be a much more enjoyable experience if they either removed the expectation of tipping, or provided more service."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy in my tummy! Went with a friend today to check out Burger 21 & upon entering, I love the layout & all the marketing. Very clean!  They have a very full menu full of burger offerings, which made it very hard for me to decide. Always a favorite at other burger joints, I decided on the black & bleu burger - with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, tomato & onion. You are able to choose how you want your burger cooked. I chose medium well. And of course, I had to have fries. We chose our sauces at the \"sauce bar\" - there was favored mayos & other dipping/topping sauces to choose from.  While we waited, I went to the restroom - very clean AND they have the Dyson airblade drying system! I LOOOOVE Dyson products, so I was so excited to see this in the restroom.   After I came back out, only a few minutes later our food arrived. Presentation was neat (check my picture). Burger & fries were cooked to perfection & they were oh so tasty. I had a fountain drink of Barg's Root Beer & it was deliciously refreshing.   Prices are pretty steep, but the burger was pretty big & the fries were a plenty.  Parking can be an issue, since they share space with many other businesses & restaurants.   I'm pleased & so was my belly!"}
{"text":"Probable the best turkey burgers around also they have 10 different sauces for the fries and burgers. Shakes are not bad but one downside is that they do not have malt powder...is it so hard for place that serves shakes to have malt anyway not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"So happy to have a great burger place close by that is reasonably priced & high quality!  When you come in, the people at the registers always warmly greet you, give you a menu & explain how things work. They also are patient if you need time to read the menu.  They have one of the new Coke machines where you have mutual options. They also have multiple sauce options to choose from. The Thai ketchup (not spicy) and honey mustard are very good.  You take a number, get a table and they bring you your food. Everyone is very friendly.  My mom & I really liked the cheesy cheeseburger because it's high quality beef, moist, juicy & has great flavor. My husband liked his plain burger. My cousin liked her burger salad. The fries are good too. The regular fry is enough for two people.  Right now if you sign up for their app you can get a free cheesy cheeseburger code sent to you.  I ordered a chocolate and peanut butter milkshake & loved it. It was creamy, delicious & had a lot of delicious peanut butter. My husband ordered a chocolate malt ball milkshake & he really enjoyed it.  We've been there several times & love it."}
{"text":"I took my grown son here for his birthday lunch. He ordered the pizza hamburger and he absolutely loved it. He also ordered the tiramasu shake which he said just tasted like iced coffee. I ordered the turkey club and it was fantastic. The bun wasn't too big and was toasted. I could tell the turkey burger must be made in-house as it looked like ground turkey breast meat, not the mulched stuff you buy at the store. Fries were great. Will definitely come back, but will have to save up for this as it's not within our normal budget.  Staff was friendly and order came out quick."}
{"text":"I'll lay a hearty welcome out on the table for this burger chain coming to the Queen City. I've been a fan of these guys since my first visit a few years ago in Tampa. Unique and decent variety of menu items, of which the stars are the burgers (obviously) and even pays homage to some old school joints of olde.   You're bound to land on a burger that you'll like under this roof. My favorite is definitely the Tuna Burger. Though, anything with rare tuna is going to be a hit with me. I will note that the TexMex Stack Burger was good, but lacked structure. The burger artist who assembled my most recent mess decided to put the lettuce and tomato on the bottom. Not sure if that's the Burger21 doctrine, but it made for some slippery handling. Not a fan.   Biggest aspect to approach for you first-timers? The sauce bar. Do yourself a favor and order the good ol' NC favorite -- sweet potato fries, and try out the Toasted Marshmallow sauce. Yep. You read that correctly.   Others of note are the Thai Ketchup and Chipotle Mayo. Both a nice touch.   Prices are decent, though you'll probably pay a little bit more for a full meal.   Have to say it's a big positive for Ballantyne Village. This place will do just fine in the 28277."}
{"text":"Neighbor was craving a burger the other evening and mentioned that one of her coworkers absolutely loves this place.  Since it was only a hop, skip and no jump away, we rolled over there to check it out.  The joynt is hip looking, with a cozy and super clean ambiance, along with a very competent, friendly staff that has an awesome work ethic.  Our burgers were absolutely DELICIOUS.  They were juicy, well seasoned and cooked to perfection.  Cold beer was available to wash it all down.  The fries were average for my taste.  In my opinion, if you offer such thin fries then they should be crispier and served standing up Belgian style, instead of wilted inside a little serving dish.   Now, if you're one of those munchers that thinks all burgers should cost about the same price as those fast food chains, or you're the type that thinks you're getting quality food at that $6.99 all you can eat Vegas buffett, then you might think this place is too expensive for your lint filled pocket.  Now if you don't mind spending a bit more for quality, then pop right in and have a bite.   What impressed us most, was how friendly the staff was.  They acknowledged every customer on arrival and departure.  They checked in with each table, to ensure all was good and they kept busy at all times, cleaning, prepping and interacting.  Kudos to management for having such an impressive staff.  So many businesses could benefit from your training policy.  I'm looking forward to my return visit in October."}
{"text":"Very delicious!! Its a great place to sit and eat ur burger!! Only complain I had is I then no bacon but found bacon in my sandwich when I got home!!"}
{"text":"You can't be a burger place and make a burger with no flavor. This might pass for a place that does not normally do burgers but Five Guys kicks the pants off this place.   Fries were good but not enough to boost my rating."}
{"text":"Have heard how good this place is so we finally got a chance to swing by and there's a sign saying temporarily closed for a funeral. While reading that sign, a delivery driver of paradise bakery next to it said the sign has been up for over a month, and there was paperwork from the landlord about not paying their rent taped to their doors... so it appears to be permanently closed down."}
{"text":"First time at this burger joint and if there was one in Raleigh I would be back sooner.  Had the bleu cheese burger & the bacon cheesey buger and they were well worth the calories and the $8.  The French fries are thin like mcdonalds which just happen to be my favorite kind.  The sauce bar is so good, the apple cider sauce with the salty fries is a match made in heaven.  What really impressed me was that we saw the manager making sure all was clean, little things like that go a long way, especially at a chain.    The 4 out of 5 is because my husband had a bowl of chili which he said had no flavor at all.  Regardless of that fact I will be back for a burger next time I come across another of these."}
{"text":"I struggle with this review.  I have been to B21 a couple times for the turkey club - almost always a delicious burger unless the cook burns the crap out of one side and still serves it!  (That only happened one time though).  So I will say the food deserves 3 stars.  However, everytime I order this artisan burger the bun is a veritable hockey puck.  Inedible!!!   So, in the spirit of eating healthier I just toss the bun aside and eat the turkey patty (yum!)!   The 2 stars are for the cleanliness of the place.  It's slow most times that I go and the bar with the drinks and sauces is disgusting.  Additionally, the floors are just as gross.    I agree with everyone - overpriced food."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try them.  They told me take a seat and I would be served.  I waited 15 minutes without being approached, so I left.  No one at register to make a comment to on the way out.  The menu looks good."}
{"text":"Visited again and tried the other veg burger this time... Nothing Mediterranean about it...  The chocolate shake is yummmmmm... Must try and overall the service is very good. The chili soup is not that great...  The have a variety of sauces like toasted marshmallow etc which are quite unique in my opinion... Good lunch places with very good vegetarian options."}
{"text":"First visit lunch time, no one at the register one man calls another employees to go to the register because he was to busy talking to his friends.  That aside my  burger was good sauce bar fun. Service, well I covered that. You can ask to have your Turkey/ Beef Burger without butter to spare your arteries the load."}
{"text":"Super bland burgers. Beyond boring. I can make better on my own with minimal effort. Price is consistent with other similar upscale-ish burger joints, but I'd recommend sticking with the others. The fries are ok. The marshmallow sauce is nauseatingly strange. I wish I could un-taste it."}
{"text":"I hit this place for lunch, I was expecting so much more. I ordered a burger and drink my bill was already at 11 dollars, I ask does that by any chance come with fries. The girl who was very nice was like no its an add on. Looked at the menu almost 3 bucks to add fries. Would have put me close to 15 bucks for a burger and fry lunch ughhhhh. Well the burger comes out, It looks ok nothing mind blowing, I did notice looked alittle greasy which another reviewer said something. I eat it again it was fine Ive had better and for almost half the cost. Probably wont be back"}
{"text":"I always get the salad with the turkey burger on top. Yummmmmmmm.  I steal a few fries from my kids and the fries are great.  I love the dipping sauces.. Apple cider is my favorite.. Marshmallow is not bad for something different, but not my favorite...will be back soon."}
{"text":"This eatery opened July 21st. This is the first visit my partner and I  had at this restaurant. I ordered the shrimp burger and he ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger, with one order of large fries. We were expecting a great experience, based on the reviews that are here on Yelp, what we got was a mediocre experience at best. The Shrimp burger was great...great taste, excellent consistency, a very good choice, the bacon cheeseburger was dry. The order of fries in our opinion did not represent the large order that we had expected, and to make things worse, they were practically cold. We did speak with a \"mover\" (Burger 21 speak) and although he  was not apologetic, we did receive another order of fries shortly thereafter. The fries, unlike some reviews on here are nothing to write home about. When the dining experience was over, we did have 2 staff members come up to us, and ask us how we liked it. I gave them honest reviews, telling them that given the overall experience, it is nothing more than an upscale McDonalds. I think that they are focusing on  the many sauces they offer, some of which are downright weird, and the many shakes they have, not focusing on the main product. Even the napkins they give out are very chintzy. One staff member was open to the feedback, offering us free dessert, while the other member, a member of management openly disagreed with my comments, and even stated that the chef would not like to hear what we had to say. Overall, we decided that it was not horrible, but yet, we would not recommend this restaurant, and would not go out of our way to return."}
{"text":"What a nice addition to our neighborhood eateries. Burger 21 is a short walk from our condo nestled in Ballantyne Village and just the place to visit for to get your burger fix. This is like an upscale fast food burger joint. Kind of an oxymoron but no better way to describe it. The menu is filled with gourmet burgers or you can craft your own. Also chicken, turkey, fish or veggie burgers are available. You can even order a salad, but the burgers are their main thing. You order at the counter and they deliver your food to the table.   We've stopped in several times before for a shake or snack before so this wasn't our first visit. We stopped in again on July 4th because 1. you have to have a burger 2. you must watch fireworks and 3. 'Merica.   We both ordered the BBQ burger - with bacon, onion straws and BBQ sauce. The burger was cooked perfectly and the bun was beautiful. We also shared a basket of fries. Thin crispy fries reminiscent of the days when I used to frequent the ol' Golden Arches. Everyone loves fries. Seriously. What's not to love about these were the perfect fix for a McDonalds style fry without the shame if actually going to a McDonalds.  We've tried the multitudes of sauces. Some are just weird. Like toasted marshmallow. I get the idea behind it, but still, it's just weird.   We've stopped in several times for burgers, shakes, dine in and carry out, and each time the service is efficient, our orders are accurate and the facility is clean. These are things that make for an overall excellent visit.   Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Burgers in Ballantyne.  It's not an original concept - you don't have to look very far in Ballantyne to find place for a burger and a shake.    But what's different about Burger 21 - located in Ballantyne Village - is that, not only do you get a wide variety of patties to choose from, you can also choose from a wide variety of sauces to with your meal.  Patties range from beef to turkey to black bean to tuna to shrimp!  The sauces ranged from a Thai ketchup (yum) to toasted marshmallow (interesting).   My hubby and I decided on Burger 21 for a late Sunday lunch. When we arrived, we were greeted immediately and the cashier offered to walk us through the burgers and the point out the sauce bar.    We decided on the Half & Half basket of fries (potato and sweet potato), so in my carb-loving guilt, I ordered a salad - the Black & Blue Wedge.  I thought it might have been a mistake on my part but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a HUGE wedge covered in blue cheese, dressing and bacon - topped off with 3 beef slider patties.  I found it very good. The patties did get cold quicker than I would've liked, but it was on top of an iceberg (lettuce, that is).    Back to the fries, we definitely had some fun with the fry/sauce combos. My favorites were the sweet potato fries with the apple cider sauce and the potato with the Thai ketchup. YUM.   We both said we'd definitely be back - maybe to try something else. They do have chicken tenders --- Can you imagine how much fun chicken tenders and all those dipping sauces would be?"}
{"text":"No attention to detail on the order assembly...messed up my friends burger the first trip here, forgot my friends fries on second trip and forgot my little girls milk on my first trip.  My Tuna burger was very good.   They just need to work on the expediting and order assembly quality control. I will try this place again and most likely add a star to my review if all goes well, because the burgers are quite good."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place  from a few friends before our visit last night. I really liked the decor and overall vibe of the restaurant, but was unfortunately underwhelmed by the food.   I felt the burgers were decently priced, but the sides and shakes were a bit steep. My husband ordered the \"Big Cheesy\" and it was cooked perfectly, but the flavor was just average. I ordered the \"Cinco\" and while it was prepared well, I didn't like the taste. They used strange seasonings in the beef that overwhelmed everything. We did enjoy the vast sauce station for the really delicious fries, though!  We ordered a banana foster shake as we were leaving and it was quite delicious, though overpriced."}
{"text":"The staff does a great job of staying pleasant while being swamped and dealing with families. The food is very tasty - the BBQ bacon burger really hit the spot. The burgers are roughly a half pound, the applewood-smoked bacon is cooked just right, and the BBQ sauce is sweet. The fries and onion strings are not really seasoned but there is a sauce bar with a wide range of selections to make them tastier. There is currently a special shake: the kitchen sink. Highly recommend it as it tastes like every candy bar you want to have in your pantry was put in the blender. If it's just you and one other person, consider sharing a large side as it's enough to enjoy but too much to fill up on and miss out on the shakes, floats, sundaes! Seating can be tricky on colder days as there are a few tables and booths inside and they are placed close together for maximum possible occupancy. There is a sizable outdoor patio for outdoor seating. We will definitely be returning to this place for burgers, fries, and shakes."}
{"text":"Chipotle-style \"fast\" food place, but with burgers and salads. Love their burger choices and salads. Service is great! Two highlights of my visit: the sauce bar (which includes a Thai ketchup and Chipotle mayo alongside the classics of ketchup and ranch). I also love their shake bar/shakes! The shakes haves a great combination of flavors, decadent, and delicious! The shake bar is great and watch the shakes being made...it reminds me of a 50s cafe. Sorry Culvers, this is my new go to burger and shake place!!"}
{"text":"Family ate here for lunch after a morning at the train park. Delicious. I had the Great Dane Hot Dog and it was the fantastic. Everyone else had burgers and they said the same about them. They have a lot of good dipping sauces, which everyone enjoyed (though the marshmallow sauce was a bit much). Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Yep, still my favorite burger in the area. Made to order, hot and fresh... tasty fries... shakes are decent, and friendly workers. Prices are a bit high tho, so I go when I need a nest level burger."}
{"text":"Tried the ahi tuna burger today and was impressed with how it was cooked. Lightly fried and still a little raw on the inside. PERFECT! The sauce bar was a fun addition to my fries however I indulged and ordered the cheese and ale sauce which was so good that I easily could have eaten that as a side of soup. I will be back to try the other burgers. The staff was very accommodating and helpful. Great place. Hope it lasts in that spot."}
{"text":"A little pricey but the Cheesy Burger was one of the best hamburger I've eaten.  I do wish they had a Burger 21 closer to the University City area...for us...the drive was about 35 minutes one way but well worth it."}
{"text":"Expensive prices for just Mediocre food. $35 just for two people to eat!? The restaurant is so small like"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Every type of burger. The choices are endless with the type of meat. This is to me is one of Charlotte's best-kept secret. I don't think.people know about this place. If you want a new experience in burgers this is the place!"}
{"text":"Very poor service, in fact no service at all.  Numerous employees standing around scratching their asses. But no one has time to wait  on customers.  Not going back to this place again!"}
{"text":"The black bean burger is very good for those who are vegetarian. It has a good chunk of avocado in it too. Burgers in general are well prepared. I'm glad they have a mix of sweet potato and regular potato fries."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here. This review is for those who understand that it's all about the flavor and texture of the meat. Toppings are an after thought.   The meat is cooked med well unless requested otherwise. The medium well patty is tender and juicy even though the meat appears to be compressed into a preformed shape. The flavor is good but suffers slightly from what appears to be a lower fat beef. (The hyper health conscious wife thought it was the bomb diggity). The bun was soft and complemented the patty well. Toppings were fresh and tasty. On my personal burger scale this burger rates a respectable 4.25/5. The wife gives it a 4 from her one bite.   We had a side of cheese ale sauce and it was some of the best beer Cheese we've had in this area. Note- if you don't like bacon or onions, make sure to request it without as that's standard. They kindly gave is a fresh one as we don't eat either between the two of us. Sauce gets 4.5/5. They need to have pretzels to go with a beer cheese that's this good.   Fries and sweet potato fries were good but nothing to write about other than we were glad to be able to order half regular fries and half sweet potato.   The buffalo chicken sandwich was ordered not fried on gluten free bread. It comes preformed in a perfectly round shape. It had something else in it..,seasoning and bread crumbs maybe? Overall the meat had good flavor and texture. The bun was dry and crumbly. I took it off and ate just the meat and veggies.   Sauces- they have chipotle mayo, Thai chili ketchup, Apple cider mayo, marshmallow (super sweet probably meant for sweet potato fries), ketchup, mayo, mustard, honey mustard, BBQ, ranging Cajun and ranch. All depends on what flavor you're looking for. We tried them but only used ranch for the fries.   All in all, good food, good service, nice atmosphere with optional outdoor dining."}
{"text":"Yet another really good burger option for the Chandler/101 area!  Over the last few months we've gotten a Smash Burger and now a Burger21 last week. If UR into red meat, how can you go wrong?  I came here to grab something for a late night at the office and Burger21 hit the roof of my flavortown mouth. Sorry Fieri!  LOL  I kept it simple. The cardiac arrest Blue Cheese and Bacon burger for only $7.95 and a Chocolate Malt ($4.95) to wash it down. Both were good.   Expect to pay $12 or so, if you order a soft drink. Don't  those iced cold beers looked good? There's a real high probably I'll be back with some co-workers real soon."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit, after a promising first time. I ordered the featured burger - the Spicy Cow Burger, and a side of fries. \"Seasoned beef, arugula, tomato, pickled jalapeño slices, pepper jack, fried jalapeños, Frank's Red Hot\" and something called Sriranchup. Was asked how I wanted it cooked - medium. The burger looked perfect when it came out with the fries, but was a bit underdone. Otherwise pretty tasty (and messy). The fries weren't salted or very lightly - and I like that. What I don't like is nicely crisped fries that aren't hot, and that's how they were. Oh well. May give them another try, but there sure are a lot of other options out there."}
{"text":"Not allergy friendly although they appear to be. We went in on 11/25 at 5:30 pm (not busy) and selected the non gluten free menu. On the bottom of the menu it stated to let your server know if you have a food allergy. My child is allergic to dairy and eggs so I asked the server if their brioche had dairy or eggs. She smiled and said she thinks so. I asked her to check so she said she would ask her manager and left. She came back and said it does. I asked if there were any options without and she said no ,everything has dairy and eggs. Now that may very well be, but in my experience at most restaurants, usually the manager would come out or at least we we would be offered an allergen menu. Here, we were offered neither. Their gluten free menu and their allergen statement are useless without proper training.   Unless you are one of the rare people with a medical diagnosis of celiac, gluten is a sensitivity, not an allergy. In other words, your body won't try to kill you if you eat.  It is a shame this place  is not a new option for our family. I will never be back, even without my daughter. I will stick with The Habit, it is easier to find parking anyway."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, I really love the chicken tenders, they taste freshly made. Fries are really good, had a basic burger once which was average but really loved the super burger bowl salad with the bacon cheesy."}
{"text":"This feels pretty sterile.  No one was there in the middle of a Sunday afternoon.  The burgers did not seem all that juicy. Had sweet potato fries & onion rings they were just ok.  Tried a couple of the sauces - bbq & spicy ketchup.  This didn't feel like the experience or what I would expect for the quality ingredients that are toted.  Bang Bang or Five Guys are still tops in my book."}
{"text":"Love burger 21! They have a lot of options and a special on most days. The prices are very reasonable. I love the condiment bar, though I wish it would have more unique flavors there. My go to burger includes bacon and avocado. Their milkshakes are delicious! They rotate flavors so there is always a different one along with the usuals to choose from."}
{"text":"We found this place last night thanks to Yelp (and my sis-in-law's review).  My husband really wanted a burger, but I could not stomach the thought of drive-thru.  After a quick review of the places near us, we bit the bullet and tried something new.  We ordered take out so I can't comment on the restaurant since I sent the Hubs to pick it up.  I did, however, call in the order. The guy on the phone was very nice.  I did almost have a heart attack when he said it was going to be $27 for 2 burgers and fries. Let me tell you, after sampling the fare, TOTALLY worth the price!!  I ordered the Chicken Parmesan chicken burger with Cheddar & Ale fries. OMG, delish!!  The chicken burger was perfectly seasoned and cooked, the flavor of the marinara and parmesan crisp mingled so well with it, and the brioche bun was light and flavorful. An excellent combination. Then the Cheddar & Ale fries were a delight. The fries by themselves were great. But the sauce was even better. My husband loved the fries but was not a fan of the Cheddar & Ale sauce, but he hates alcohol and it has a very beer finish (as it should since Ale is in the title).  So if you don't like alcohol, I don't recommend it.  He ordered the OMG burger and OMG he thought it was great. He usually can power through a double burger just about anywhere, but this was so big he couldn't finish. Unless you haven't eaten all day, the result may be the same for you. He recommends just get 1 patty and will do that in the future. But the flavor was great and it was perfectly cooked.  I wish I had tried a shake. The Creme Brulee shake sounded terrific, but I will be sure to try it on our next visit."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, light and bright atmosphere, great fries...no complaints.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Burger 21 always does right by us! The owner that we met is awesome and the food & customer service is great! We've been here several times and love this establishment. It's always clean and they have a \"no touch required\" hand wash station behind the dining area that is very convenient.   The BBQ Bacon Burger is sooooo delicious! I've tried the Cinco de Mayo and Tex-Mex Haystack & wasn't a fan of them but the owner/manager on duty definitely made up for it (another reason we love this place). He personally came by to see how we were doing and offered to give us a new order (but we were a little full from the fries and what we had eaten of the burgers already) - so instead gave us vouchers to come back and order something else AND free cookies lol!  So yes, we love Burger 21. Next on the \"to try\" list are the milkshakes and some non-beef items. Oh and the basket of fries are always hot, fresh & delicious. There are a ton of sauces at the condiment bar. Definitely can't forget about alllll of the sauces, thai ketchup being a favorite! This place is a must try for a great burger day or night. Hopefully I'll be able to move this to five stars once I try some of their other menu items :)  #NoMoreFiveGuysAfterThisPlace"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good :) They'll be nice and busy!!! The cob salad was okay, but the burgers and fries were delightful."}
{"text":"Ventured out of my safe zone yesterday for a cheese steak burger.  It was great.  Spicy with green chilies and probably some jalapeno someplace in it it was zesty and delicious.  As with all of their burgers, take on plenty of napkins as juicy is a well used adjective at Burger 21.  Service is a trust issue as you are given a number to put on your table stand in the hopes that a server with what you ordered will appear with your meal.  It is an \"L\" shaped dining area so not all tables are in sight of the main counter.  But it works and I watched the server casually and routinely fetch napkins, hot sauce and other things for a customer with a cane.  Nice to see.  They also have a child size shake.  I appreciate it as I like shakes, esp malts, but hate to wolf down all the calories of a regular size portion.  The kid size is excellent, giving you the flavor and experience without the potential weight gain.  Parking can be a problem as once the interior parking places are taken you are relegated to the back 40 two story parking garage.  A good walk for the elderly or handicapped, so if you have any such in your party, drop them at the door, at the annoyance of the backed up potential parkers, so they can get in without the hump from the garage."}
{"text":"Good Cinco burger and Vanilla shake. Some good sauces to try with fries. Will be back..."}
{"text":"Burger 21 is one of the relatively recent burger chains that has popped up.  I knew it had been here for a while but only recently tried it one day when Extreme Pita was permanently closed.    My first two visits were very good.  I got my orders two go.  Whether you dine in or out, you place your order at the counter and they will bring it to you.  The people working are always friendly and very accommodating which does need seem to be the norm these days.  My orders were accurate and the burgers and salad were good.  The burgers were cooked medium well as requested.  The fries leave a lot to be desired.  They are previously frozen and always have way too much salt added to them.  Thankfully they have a sauce bar with twelve sauces to drown out the salt.    On my last visit I again got my order to go.  I ordered the burger of the month which was a burger with fried egg and bacon.  It was quite messy which I initially thought was from the egg.  There was so much going on in the burger though the the toppings hid the rareness of the burger.  It was almost entirely pink except for the outside.  My stomach hurt so bad that night that I hardly slept. I did not return the burger because I just live too far from the place.  I did fill out the survey though to let them know about it.  This was the only issue out of three experiences so I'll go back.  I will just make sure my burger is cooked next time."}
{"text":"Keepin it simple.  Burgers were great. Absolutely great. And if I rated just on burgers, I'd give this place five stars. But I dont.  I was really bummed they didn't have the cheese ale fries - which I heard was fantastic. Who runs out of cheese at a burger place?!?  Service was odd. They were friendly...however having six different people come up to you every five minutes with your mouth full of burger was slightly excessive. It passed the point of being attentive to the point where it seemed they were rushing us out...even though there were only two other groups of people there.   Little pet peeve of mine - employees with cellphones will always create a negative experience for me.  Moving on...ketchup bar!  Toasted Marshmallow - disgusting.  It was a cross between vanilla yogurt and icing. Think and runny.  Ragin Cajun - nice with a little kick!  Thai Ketchup - it was good! Maybe could use a bit more spice.  Chipotle Mayo - It's no Copper Blue's,  but it's pretty good.  In conclusion,  I must admit I like this new little burger place. But perhaps I'll do To-Go next time."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers. For two people averages around $30 for burgers, sides and a drink, but the food is very consistent. The fries and burger buns very crispy. They also have low carb option with a lettuce wrap. Download the app and you get a free cheeseburger! They also have a loyalty punch card on the app. Service is quick and food is tasty."}
{"text":"Honestly it wasn't a precious day at burger 21. When I took a look at the restaurant from outside I thought \"wow, it looks so modernized and full of potentially amazing mouth watering burgers.\" I am a burger fanatic and I've been in search for a great burger for a couple of years. My girlfriend and I enter the restaurant and we were both intrigued by the interior. Nice, modern, and really positive.  I ordered the burger 101(medium-well).It looked great so why not? Once I ordered the burger my girlfriend and I sat at one of the booths by the window. It was nice to watch the environment outside. The burger took about 10 minutes to be served to us and it looked great,I can't lie.. However, when I took a bite into the burger I notice the meat was way too red... And my girlfriend ordered medium well too, and hers was perfect! I was a little surprised because I expected a well cooked burger. I decided to give it try. But By the end of the meal I just felt gut sick to my stomach. I couldn't handle the red. But on a positive note, the fries were great and seriously the environment is great to be in. Servers are nice, well kept, and attentive."}
{"text":"Not sure what the great reviews are for. Overpriced. Greasy, and no flavor. 10 dipping sauces, maybe 2 or 3 are edible. Fries are decent.  I've had better. Won't return."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger.  I agree w/others that the regular fries are just 'okay' and the sweet potato fries are very good, especially with the toasted marshmellow sauce.  Our favorite sauce was the Ragin Cajun.  I had the BBQ burger (excellent, will get again), and my son had the bacon cheese sliders, he really liked them."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and each time it has progressively gotten worse. I noticed that the employees and the establishment itself are very dirty. My last experience and will literally be my last was horrible. We ordered and sat down and surprisingly the food was brought out pretty fast (they're usually always slow to serve you) but my burger was wrong, I had ordered it plain and it came out with every topping on it. So the young lady went in the back and picked off all the toppings with her bare fingers and returned with a hamburger soggy with ketchup. There was also a man at the counter complaining that his burger had something in it that was hard as a rock and he had no idea what it was neither did the manager. It looked repulsive whatever it was. My husband also was poisoned from this experience. I will not be returning"}
{"text":"Won't be back. Greasy. Overpriced. Was told the burgers were gluten free before we came. Only the beef burgers are. Fries were boring and super salty. Across the parking lot is whole foods. They have great burgers. Here's my last complaint we arent full and are going to whole foods to fill up. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! So excited for such a great burger place in chandler! Fresh meat, lots of variety and great service! Will be back, often."}
{"text":"Wow! So good! Had the chicken parm burger and way better than expected ..going back soon to try other burgers! And the vanilla shake was amazing too."}
{"text":"COMPLETELY over priced.  Tiny portions Mediocre food  Only good thing I can say, The service was good"}
{"text":"Burger 21 is yet another excellent burger joint in South Charlotte. After three visits, I am very comfortable in stating that this place is a Gotta Try!  Unfortunately, I am limited in what I can recommend as I never make it past the first item on the menu, the Burger 101, which is their standard burger all the way. Be prepared to use plenty of napkins as these juicy angus burgers will require lots of them. They realize too that the bun matters, for a great burger on a mediocre bun ruins the entire product. Theirs is a simple and delicious toasted brioche bun.  Regular and sweet potato fries are also delicious and are available in three sizes. Their sauce bar is  even worth noting and includes mayos available in more than a dozen flavors from self-serve pumps beside the fountain drink refill station. Mayo flavors include Ragin Cajun and Chipotle. Service is attentive and friendly. Open and airy dining areas available in and out.  We love the handwashing station in the eating area, which is a real testimony to their impeccable sanitary rating. Not sure if I'll ever make it to them but their menu is loaded with other choices other than burgers, including delicious looking chicken and turkey sandwiches. In its category, this joint is, again, a Gotta Try!"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that the food is good, but your service is terrible. They can't put the order in correctly...even if you repeat it. It is very slow and it wasn't very busy. It is extremely cold in the restaurant. My family has been many times. This was my first visit and they told me what I experienced tonight is normal practice. You should really try to improve. Hiring more responsible adults and not kids who are too busy flirting with young customers than serving the people who came in first. Absolutely ridiculous !"}
{"text":"Went to this place based on the google reviews.  First thing I asked was do you dry or grill your burgers, the guy says \"grilled of corse\" We place our order, 2 burgers with cheese, fries and two drinks...$26.00! The guy says you want the medium well right, I said no hockey puck for me, medium please.  The medium well thing is suggested to everyone behind me I'm a bit amazed.  Food comes out, small portions, especially for $26.00, I look at the burger, the fried not grilled burger, greasy as all get out (which is expected with a fried burger, this is why I asked), now I get it why they recommend med well, it's a real chore to cook a burger on the flat top and get it anything but med well.  Although a bit tasty, im really disappointed they lie, I mean if you going to serve McDonalds style burgers own up to it.  For the money I could have had 4 times the food and at much better quality from cookout.  2 stars because the place was clean and the girl who brought the food out was very nice."}
{"text":"Came to this new burgahhhh joint on a Saturday night and boy was it crowded. There's hardly any room but that's a good sign, right? The service is slow but very friendly. I m thinking the slow service is due to this restaurant being new. I got the Ybor city espresso shake and it was delicious! Thick and rich."}
{"text":"This review is for their to-go orders only.. although inside looked really cute and clean. Great looking shakes and everything was really fresh!  Their online ordering was a snap -- really easy, and great to customize your burgers. Lots of options.. fancy and the classics. They use toasted brioche which is incredible and just perfect. The burger was juicy.. even with transit (but not soggy). We got the basket of sweet potato fries for the 3 of us (and it may have been too much, but I have no self control when it comes to these things), which were shoestring cut and just absolutely delicious.. perfectly salted.   I didn't get a chance to try anything too fancy or \"artisan\" if you will.. that night I was just in the mood for a classic cheeseburger with carmelized onions done right, and they delivered. Next time I'm in town and I'm craving a burger, I think I'll come in and sit for a while.. and even have a milkshake."}
{"text":"Spicy. Thai. Shrimp. Burger.  Seeing that on the menu did it for me - I had to have - and I did!  It was delicious!  I also had the half & half fries, sweet potato and regular.   There are lots of other specialty burgers on the menu that I will be back to try.   Order at the counter, and then they will bring it out to you. Interior decor is very much like you would find in a chain, so nothing special, but there is a nice patio to use on a warm day."}
{"text":"The fast-casual burger joint invasion has been hitting Charlotte for the last few years.  Versions of every shape and size popping up offering their versions of the American classic.  And mostly, they've been disappointing.  Until now...  Burger21 is less than 1/4 of a mile from where I work, so I decided to hop in and check it out one day for lunch.  My expectations were fairly low (based on past experiences), but the results totally blew me out of the water!  The meat on the burger was thick, juicy, and full of flavor.  There are a variety of burgers available (along with the required \"build your own\") to cater to all tastes!  And if you want to take your burger creation just a little bit further, a sauce/topping bar with a number of available sauces is available for your perusal.    Price-wise?  A little bit on the high side, but I don't mind paying for good quality.    Atmosphere?  Very clean, with a variety of tables and high-tops.  Bar seating (at the milkshake making station) is also available.  The one thing that didn't really impress me?  The fries.  Meh... take 'em or leave 'em.  But that burger will be bringing me back again and again!"}
{"text":"Another burger place in the Ballantine area... Great!  Unfortunately there is limited street parking in front of the building, so be prepared for a walk from the nearby parking deck during busy times of the day.   Walking into Burger21 you are greeted by a PPP predominantly white & open space that is somewhat on the small side. Everything is clean, but the lack of color makes things look a bit hospital-like.   Everything is ordered a LA carte. Choose from 19 different Angus beef burgers, two seafood, four chicken or two vegetarian option. This is a fast-casual design, so you order at the counter, get a number, and the food is brought out to you. The lack of a large wall mounted menu means you are scrambling for the paper menus.   The burgers themselves are nice and juicy, but I found them to be lacking in flavor. Some additional seasoning would really help with the flavor.   The fries on the other hand were excellent. Thinly sliced and nice and crispy. These were some of the best fries I have had in a long time.  Burger21 also has a large selection of different types of ketchup, so you can flavor tour fries to your liking.   Prices were in line with what you would pay at a full service sit down restaurant (at least as far as lunch prices are concerned).   Overall Burger 21 is not a bad option, but it is nothing special either. There are better options for burgers in this area."}
{"text":"Burger21 was a great experience. You can taste the freshness in the meat with every bite. After talking with the owner for a few minutes you can tell his passion for food and burgers. They have a vast selection of burgers, and food. They have close to 10+ different dipping sauces and was very impressed.  The only item I wished had a little better taste or texture would be the generic regular fries.   Hats off to Burger21 and I am glad to add this to my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I wish I could review the food, but was completely unable to get service Saturday night, Dec. 13. My husband and I came in Saturday night after visiting the Railroad Park's holiday lights with family. We simply wanted hot chocolate that was marked as a special with signs on the front doors. There was one table full of customers eating, three teenage boys at the bar and at the other end of the bar two teenage girls. The girls had their shakes already and the only employee on the floor was chatting with them. My husband and I sat on the end of the bar near the teenage boys...waited a few minutes, weren't acknowledged or glanced at as the conversation continued at the other end of the bar. After a few more minutes, my husband decided to use the restroom while I placed the order...hopefully a quick to go order. Two other teenage male servers and an older adult male server or worker came out. One brought one shake to the 3 teen boys next to me, who then asked where their other two shakes were to the confusion of the server. None of the 4 employees glanced at me, acknowledged me, or asked why I might even be there after about 10 minutes (conversation going strong between the one teen server and teen girl customers still.) My husband returned from the bathroom, we waited some more & I said, well, \"Maybe we should just leave.\" One of the teen boys sitting next to us said, \"That sounds like a good idea.\" He and his friends were also upset at their lack of service. The trio of teen boys still hadn't received their missing 2 shakes and no worker had ever acknowledged our presence, with only one table filled with 3 customers. The only customers getting attention were those that the workers seemed to want to flirt with. As my husband and I walked out after being ignored for roughly 15 minutes, I started to ask for a manager, but my husband said forget it, it's not even worth it. Hope somebody else gets service, not better service, just service."}
{"text":"I was craving a big juicy burger so I decided to try this place out and man that burger was Flavorful. I ordered \"the OMG\" burger land it very was delicious.They have some really great menu options. Oh and I was definitely diggin the sauce bar. I'll be coming  back to try the Tex mex haystack!!!"}
{"text":"My mother and I came here wanting to try some place new and since I'm on a Paleo/Primal kick, I figured this would be a great place to check out.  Upon entering we were greeting with a friendly smile by the cashier at an order counter that I slowly walked up to saying that this was our first time here. She was very enthusiastic and proceeded to explain the menus to us (regular and gluten free) and told us how it worked (i.e. we order here at the counter, they give us a number that we place on a table, the staff brings out food, but its self serve at the drink station).  My mother ordered the Burger 101 ($6) which is a plain burger and I ordered the Super Burger Bowl ($8) which is a salad topped with the patty of your choice plus bacon bites and we split the large half and half sweet potato/regular fries basket ($4) and both choose to get fountain drinks ($2.19/ea). Our total after tax was $24.   After we ordered we went off and snagged one of the four booths and then headed to the condiment/fountain drink area. They serve Coke products and even have a dispenser with Vitamin Water in the acai-blueberry-pomegranate flavor. I opted for the unsweetened iced tea (either sweetened or unsweetened) and was left with an underwhelming dissatisfaction with their iced tea. I am not sure what happened, but I would advise getting it and I was wishing I went with the Vitamin Water. After we got our drinks we side stepped to the condiment section which has 10 options of dipping or topping sauces: thai ketchup, chipotle may, toasted marshmallow, honey mustard, bbq, ragin' cajun, apple cider, ranch, ketchup, and mustard. We choose to try three, the thai ketchup, toasted marshmallow, and the regular ketchup. The thai ketchup had a spice to it, but it wasn't hot-spicy and toasted marshmallow - was gross. It tasted like melted frosting and was way too sweet for me, I just stuck with the regular ketchup.   Our orders came out pretty fast and my mom enjoyed her burger and I loved my Burger Bowl. The patty was cooked perfectly! It was pink all throughout the center making it the right amount juicy - so juicy that I didn't even need to use the salad dressing that I ordered as a side. The fries were also a-ok, but nothing to write home about, I guess that's why there is a large condiment bar. Regardless, my mother and I would not hesitate to return for another meal. The décor is a clean white with pops of color. Paintings on the wall were black and white photographs with colored areas (like the eyes). There are only 4 booths in this entire place that could seat 4 people comfortably and 6 people more intimately. The booths are also narrow not leaving much room between you and the table. For bigger parties you could push several of the floor tables together or take advantage of 2 of their high top tables that seat 8 people.  There is also a bar in the back center of the building with 9 stools for those that enjoy that type of atmosphere. Bathroom wise, there are two basic single occupancy bathrooms, one for males and one for females. They get the job done.   I've never been a burger person, but would recommend this place to anyone interested!"}
{"text":"The lowdown: Burgers are pretty decent, cooked perfectly as requested medium and served on brioche bun. Prices a bit high for what it is though. They have about 8 varieties of sauces to choose from for your fries, such as apple cider, marshmallow & Thai ketchup. Problem is many are mayo based or overly sweet. Really tried to hard and it's not good. Fries both sweet and regular are just average. Place was clean and empty on a Thursday night at 7pm $23 for 2 basic burgers and order of half/half fries and one soda. Too pricey for just average. In and out and habit are just plain better not only on the food but also price. However, I hope they make it but I just don't see it."}
{"text":"I love this place! The Spicy Thai Shrimp burger is excellent!!! The sauces are unique and its fun to taste them on the food."}
{"text":"Went for the first time. Service was lacking to say the least. Food was OK, but we have not rushed back.  Service is everything and if the guest has to beg for help, this might need some improvement ."}
{"text":"The only thing better than the food - is the staff.   Bacon cheese burger was great - and the side salad was big enough to share ..."}
{"text":"Burger 21 is part of a national chain, but apparently there are only two of the them west of the Mississippi. This one and one in Scottsdale. Sleek, clean, with both indoor and outdoor seating. Parking is very tight during lunch time (there is a Paradise Bakery next door and they share parking).  Pros: *The burgers are delish! I had the Philly cheese burger with peppers and onions ($7.99) and my friend had the mushroom burger ($7.99). They normally cook them medium well, but I asked for mine with no pink in the middle and they nailed it perfectly. The quality of the meat was excellent. *Both my friend and I had the malted milk ball chocolate shakes ($4.99) and they were awesome.  Cons:  *Our food did not come to the table all together. First my burger shows up. A little while later our shakes show up. After a further wait, my friend's burger shows up. Who serves food in stages like that? *The line to order is weird. It is too short and after a few people are in line it blocks the door so that you can neither enter nor exit (you would think that the local Fire Marshall would have heartburn over how that works). *Prices are a little high for this market (maybe on the East coast or in California they would be in line, but not in AZ).   I will return and try some of the other items on the menu in future."}
{"text":"A solid burger and the sauce station is a nice novelty.  About a half star better and dollar or two more expensive then its corporate cousin over at Smash Burger."}
{"text":"Best burger ( black & blu )I've had since moving to AZ eleven years ago...service was excellent and the place is really clean...sauce station is excellent."}
{"text":"Walked in before they were officially open and ended up getting a free meal! Got the burger they had on special for the month (forgot the name but it had a fried pickle in it) and it was delicious...and huge! Ops Manager came around and gave me a pumpkin pie shake as well. Will definitely be going back when I want a gourmet burger!"}
{"text":"I am always looking for a good burger and Burger21 exceeded my expectations. The atmosphere is really nice and the menu has a lot of options. I ordered the BBQ bacon burger and the burger was juicy and flavorful without being over cooked. I also ordered the sweet potato fries which were a little salty but really good ! The dipping sauce bar was really cool and I tried the interesting toasted marshmallow sauce, it was not my favorite. The Thai chili was really good but not good with sweet potato fries lol. I unfortunately didn't get to try the milkshake but I did try the chocolate chip cookies and they were really great ! I will be back to try other menu items soon!"}
{"text":"Great burger.  Loved the variety of ketfchups they had.  Wish I wasn't on a diet because I wanted to try the shakes!"}
{"text":"Great burger selection... Freshly made, not pre-fab frozen food service patties... The buns are excellent  Milk shakes are great"}
{"text":"McDonald's style fries, tasteless burgers , we asked for no blue cheese on salad , it came with it . We complained, all we got was SORRY  FRIES WERE DROPPED BY FOOD RUNNER AND TOOK 15 min to replace.  My friends burger was undercooked   The place is very loud and cold   No reason to return. We spoke to manager - owner and our situation wasnt rectified, it just helped the next customer. Lol"}
{"text":"Fell in love with their burger after trying it out the first time. The two I have had are Mediterranean chicken and thai chili shrimp, both are absolutely delicious to the core. The patties tasted fresh and full of flavour and taste. The wide variety of sauces available here is a must try. The ragin cajun was a big hit in our group. I am already craving the burger as I write this review, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had the ahi tuna burger. Very tasty, well balanced patty, sauces and bun. Fries were crispy and flavorful but nothing special. Prices were decent. I'll have to try a beef burger next time."}
{"text":"First visit and if I'm ever in the area again I would eat there but it's not going g to be a destination burger. Has the bacon cheese burger. Choice of cheese, good thing. Burger was medium well, much more medium rare, but that's so much better then all dried out. Fry's average at best. Never did taste any bacon. Sure not Five Guys, my standard,  at about the same price. Best thing was the different dipping sauces you can choose from. I just wasn't real impressed."}
{"text":"It is always nice to have a good selection of quality burger places around my neck of the woods.  I love burgers and Burger21 didn't disappoint at all.  There are a ton of options and good shakes as well.  They asked if I wanted my burger med-well, at which I said no please, med-rare.  They said no problem and it came out cooked perfectly!  I always appreciate when restaurants accommodate the way you like burgers cooked, as too many places will only cook med+ and dry out their burgers.  For our fries, there was a ton of different dipping sauces to choose from (I forgot to take a picture, but it was a nice option).  I remember the chipotle mayo was preter good.  My daughter of course, liked the plain old ketchup.  I saw a shrimp burger come out which looked better than my beef burger, but I would still recommend the hamburger unless you are apposed to beef!  The atmosphere is typical fast food decor, with a very nice clean dining area.  I will be back for sure and look forward to trying other burger combinations!  Check it out if your in the area, it's in the Whole Foods parking lot Ray Rd / 101"}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!!! I Dined there for lunch on Wednesday with some friends  The food tasted good but I paid the ultimate price to eat there, food poisoning yuck!! And when I called to complain Thursday the manager is a know it all!!! I think her name was Margaret wanted to argue with me about what was on the food that I ordered! I felt she was trying to pass the blame! Talking over me while I was trying to explain to her what happened. Horrible horrible horrible experience"}
{"text":"Let me just tell you.....not many places get Five stars from me....but this is a rare exception!  At first I thought, great ANOTHER burger place (since that is all the rage right now).  Boy, didn't take long to figure out this was no ordinary burger joint.  The location is awesome of course being at the village.  The interior is bright, modern, clean, and cheery.  There is also a huge covered patio outside that is really fun.  The staff is amazing.  High-end restaurant service at a burger place.....unheard of!  They are all friendly, fun, energetic, and really helpful!  They suggest things for you, answer questions, come by the table several times while you are eating, etc.  A manager usually comes by at least once, and is always super friendly.  When you walk in, you mosey up to the counter where you are warmly welcomed.  They have menus all over the place, and eagerly await your questions (which there always are).  The have tons of burgers, and they even have \"real\" chicken burgers...not just a breast or a ground up mess, but a unique textured patty that is lightly browned on the outside, and juicy on the inside.  There yummy sides...but the best are the skinny crunchy sweet potato fries!  Did I mention they have a hand-crafted milkshake bar???  OMG is all I can say about that!!!  After that, you pick a great table or booth, then you get to browse the dipping sauce bar!  That's right, a row of awesome dipping sauces like toasted marshmellow or thai ketchup.  They are incredible!  Finally, a fresh and friendly take on a greasy burger joint....simply put, delicious.  One of my favorite places in Ballantyne now...I am addicted and go pretty much once a week!!  Everyone enjoy, and to the employees, managers, and owners...BRAVO!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok but nothing to shout home about. The burgers were kinda bland, the fries were not really flavorful and were kinda mushy. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Delish! Service is fast and great. Turkey patty and veggie oh and don't let me forget the chicken patty. Good! Try the sweet potato fries with marshmallow and apple cider dipping sauce. Place the patties on the Cobb salad minus the bacon and get the raspberry vinaigrette, OMG!"}
{"text":"Our first time at Burger 21. The menu gives a nice variety of burgers (beef, chicken & veggie). We tried the Chicken Parmesan Burger and the Black & Bleu Burger. The Chicken Parm was very tasty. The Black & Bleu Burger had a clean taste; not greasy. The Angus was great! The fries were hot & fresh...very good. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was quiet and inviting. This is not your normal burger & fry combo joint."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I am a huge Black and Bleu Cheeseburger fan, and this place definitely delivered. My wife got the Tex Mex, a burger with onion strings, Gouda, and guacamole, and she loved it. The fries were fine, but the compilation of sauces compensated for the fries being so dull in comparison to the burger. The Ragin Cajun sauce was the best.   The blonde cashier wasn't happy to be working, which is fine- work sucks sometimes, but don't let it affect the thirty seconds you actually speak to someone.   The younger gentleman walking the floor was very nice and sold me on signing up for the Burger 21 Club.  Overall, great experience and the food was absolutely marvelous."}
{"text":"Priced about a buck too expensive is my only negative. Their food was prompt, hot and delicious. Ordered the Monterey Chicken and it was spicy but devine. The BBQ Bacon burger was perfect and the Cheesy burger was a hearty, happy burger though the least of the bunch.  Their sweet potato fries were thin and the perfect amount of crisp.   Try all the in-house sauces. They rock. I really liked both toasted mashmallow and apple cider on the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Being a burger fanatic, I'm almost always in search of the perfect burger.  So as the weeks went by and I continued to pass Burger 21, I finally decided to stop in last night and indulge in some burger goodness and a shake.  Walking in, I was slightly reminded of Smashburger or a trendy froyo spot.  One of the gentlemen working there kindly pointed me and my family to the front of the restaurant where I can order, since there are two entrances.  Throughout the meal, this same man stopped by our table to see how we're doing and if we needed anything.  It was refreshing, and I could sense that this man actually loved his job (a rarity in the service industry these days).  But you're probably wanting to hear more about the food than the service, so here it is.  The burgers are amazing!  My wife ordered my BBQ Bacon Burger medium (GASP! A faux pas in my search for the perfect burger), but surprisingly it was tender and juicy.  The burger was stacked and about 5\" tall, but still manageable to eat.  The fries were great as well; not too crispy and not too soft.  We ordered their cheese/ale sauce and tried a sampling of their vast array of sauces (though I did stay away from Toasted Marshmallow sauce), and I have to admit the Chipotle Mayo was my favorite.    The milkshake was, how should I say this? Dreamy!  It was blended smooth, the chocolate and peanut butter was blended so well and neither seemed to overpower the other.    My overall recommendation? If you love burgers, you gotta go here at least once.  It's really good."}
{"text":"I got the cheesy burger w/Cheddar. reg fry &cheese sauce.The prices r good. The burger was nothing special.i ordered it med well &it came out well.The cheese sauce &fries was REALLY good. They also have a long list of dipping sauces. The toasted marshmallow was surprisingly really good.The staff was great. But they did have a problem w/the table next to me.The cashiers rang in the wrong order &when they fixed the order they brought it out wrong again.The family was pretty much done w/the food before she got hers.Everyone was so extremely apologetic tho I guess it made ok. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here as of now. hopefully I will after I have the buffalo burger because that thing looks amazing !"}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this place! I got the haystack burger both times I've been there and it's just killer. The burger is so juicy, the brioche buns are killer and best of all--the sauce bar with like 12 unique sauces! Thank you Jesus, I love sauce bars. Service is good and quick and the ambience is modern and clean. Great for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the burger and fries today!  I had the Cheesy burger and my friend had the shroom burger.  Very good selection and prices!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food was great! I order a bbq bacon burger. Exceptionally great. The have a full self serve bar of customized sauces!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! I split a buffalo chicken tenders basket and a Bacon BBQ burger. The tenders were VERY spicy, too hot for my liking. I loved the fries that they came with, though. You can get regular, sweet potato, or a half and half mix. They have tons of different sauces to dip your fries in. We loved the Cajun Ranch and Honey Mustard. You help yourself to the sauces so you can try as many as you like. The burger was delicious - juicy and very flavorful. Burger 21 serves one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh, in my opinion.   We also got a banana fosters milkshake. SO GOOD. Very thick, though. It was my favorite part of the meal!   BEWARE: if you or your child is sensitive to noise, the milkshake machine makes a horrible noise. Metal on metal ear piercing shrieking. Reminded me of the drill at the dentist. I will be getting takeout or eating outside because of this noise - gave me chills. Otherwise, awesome restaurant!"}
{"text":"Just about one of the best burger places I have been too. I also love the fries (both regular & sweet potato) and sauce bar. The marshmallow sauce is tasty! We've had just about everything on the menu and loved it all. The peanut butter cookies are the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. They have awesome chicken tenders and burgers!! A must try, great for lunch."}
{"text":"After coming to Burger 21 several more times, I'm going to dock my score.  The burgers are always very greasy. I mean to the point where it's disgusting.  The entryway isn't designed well; it only takes about six people in line before you're out the door.  The milkshakes are microscopic for the price you pay. They're tasty, though, but imagine going to McDonald's and paying $12 for a medium shake. That's a good analogy.  For the prices of the burgers, fries should come with them. The fries are nothing special; cold, greasy, and tasteless. I'd personally prefer regular fries over the shoestring fries, but I won't hold that against them. Even with the sauce bar, all you taste is the sauce (the sweet potato fries are marginally better).  I'm not sure what the target audience is for Burger 21, but it's very expensive. A friend and I came here and together ordered two burgers, two fountain drinks, and one side of fries, and it was $35. Plus, we always manage to leave hungry, even after exhausting our caloric intake for the next three days.  I'm sorry, Burger 21. I really wanted to like you, but I just can't. For the price point, I'll award one star. If it was a little cheaper, I'd award two. Seems like a glorified McDonald's or Burger King to me."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time yesterday for lunch I was really excited about the menu but the service was not good at all. I ordered a gluten-free burger with gluten free fries, when the order arrived it wasn't even what I ordered. So they said they would redo my order and send a manager out to talk to me I waited 15 more minutes no one came out to talk to me finally got my burger & fries. Burger was okay fries were luke warm."}
{"text":"First visit. l plan on returning  to try out the other menu offers.  Easy ordering process featuring plenty of good choices depending on your eating preferences.  Their burger menu features angus beef  (10 beef options ) seafood, (the spicy Thai shrimp burger caught my interest)  veggie, chicken and turkey selections.  Burgers are served on a toasted  brioche bun.  If you are unable to decide on a burger you could  select  the featured burger of the month. The price points for the angus burgers range from 5.99 up to 10.99 for the OMG. Other menu options are the 3 pack slider, chicken tender basket and sandwich, gourmet dogs, salads and sides of sweet potato or regular fries.  I loved trying out the sauce bar because it allows one to step away from the traditional toppings normally offered. The servers were extremely attentive and apologetic when the burger was undercooked and they graciously offered another menu item while waiting for the burger to be cooked. I like the atmosphere and the convenience of eating a better quality burger.  I was disappointed in the milkshake because it was too sweet and was made with soft serve ice cream.  I seldom treat myself to a milkshake and when I do I usually prefer a good old fashioned shake with all the lumps in it!"}
{"text":"I am always always always down to try new burger spots. I love burgers that I can order how done I want my burger and being as particular as I can be I like having my red meat medium rare. So when they ask you medium well I feel like I had an absolute blank stare as if there weren't an option I asked if there was anyway I could have it medium rare. He agreed out the first burger down for take out and when I got to the second burger he asked about medium well for this I had the same stare but even more confused since I just said medium rare I was like um.. No medium rare again please.  I ordered the tex whatever burger that turned out to be a disappointment only as far as the toppings go. The burger itself was fantastic so much potential this is what I get for being a risk taker. :( I thought there would have been some kind of heat to this. Not even a slight hint of some heat from the \"jalapeño sauce\" just EXTREME saltiness. I love when you have the hint of salt not an over abundance of it to where I was scraping off bacon bits and then all of a sudden eating just the patty and still scraping off bacon!  I can't believe I had to even do that!   I really hope to god my boyfriends bbq bacon burger is amazing compared to mine otherwise I will feel very badly for coming here to get this for him when he gets home from work.    ***so I decided to go again with one of my good friends and try this place out sitting there and being able to enjoy my fries and burger at the establishment itself this time. This time I opted for the Thai shrimp \"burger\". Whoever says this burger is bland is absolutely full of it! This \"burger\" was my favorite I think I'll only be sticking to this from now on with fries with a side of their amazing chipotle mayo and the rajun Cajun sauce.  Both the sweet potato and the regular fries were good but the sauce rwly makes it. A word of advice as well. The marshmallow sauce was not good and the apple cider sauce was decent along with the Thai ketchup."}
{"text":"Best burger in CLT. No contest. Cowfish, Bang Bang, Bad Daddy's - none hold a candle to the meat in this burger. The fries are just okay- coated like those at BK, but with several fun dipping sauces. Shakes are better than average. The real star here is the burger meat, so keep that in mind with your ordering strategy; next time I would get a double burger, skip the fries, and convince my BF to split a shake."}
{"text":"We had the spicy shrimp and turkey Cobb burger and we were not impressed at all. The burgers were fried and tasted like the they came out of a box. We came based on the reviews and we will not be back."}
{"text":"Great burger.   Another restaurant in a fancy \"strip-mall\" (what do you expect in Charlotte?!), focused on burger, and only burger. And they do it very well... been there several time and quality has not wavered, and patties are cooked exactly as requested. Condiments are fresh, and there are many sauces choices for your fries.  Can be busy, so choose your visit time accordingly."}
{"text":"Just tried this place tonight.   Had the chicken tenders as they were the Tuesday special.  They came with a generous amount of fries and were really good.   I have to say,  the chocolate shake was fabulous!   Very clean,  great friendly staff, good atmosphere,  overall enjoyable."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers that are full of flavor. We ordered the OMG & the Black & Blue burgers. We really liked the smoked bacon flavor.   We also got a basket of sweet potato fries. They are too thin to really taste the flavor & they don't hold their heat well. The regular fries were fine. The sauce bar was super fun to experiment with!!  Desert was a chocolate peanut butter shake. It was divine!! Just the right texture and mix of flavor. Yum!!"}
{"text":"When I first walked in, it looked very modern and fun; the decor is nice. However my first impression was slightly misleading.   My brother asked how big the kids burger was. The lady told him it was about 6oz. I can assure you it was not 6oz, it was too small so he had to order an additional meal. The French fries are average, but I must say the sweet potato fries are pretty good. I ordered a Sonoma Valley salad with the addition of chicken for $2. The chicken was dry and they only gave a little bit of it. Not worth the $2. I give it 3 stars because they are still new, however, I don't think I will be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to go cause she looooves dippy sauces and they have 10 to choose from. She doesn't eat beef but they do have turkey burgers.  I ordered the mushroom and onion burger, our daughter got the cheeseburger. They were just good, not bad not awesome just good. All of these burger places rhat have bewn popping up over the last 3 years and most of them are just average just like this place. The buns were very good i will give them that and the pricing was average as well."}
{"text":"I had such a bad experience with the Ahi Tuna burger. I wish I could say I want to go back and try something else but I don't!"}
{"text":"Good selection of burgers:  beef, poultry, seafood and vegetarian options.  I ate a Cinco Burger, on which the jalapeños were good and spicy and the burger tender and juicy.  The place is modern looking, neat and clean with friendly and helpful staff.  Overall I would say the strong point is the burger options for diners wanting other than beef."}
{"text":"You want a bomb *** burger with some crispy fries that are outta this world?! Ya want a friendly staff who is as funny as they are helpful and nice? Ya came to the right place! Seriously this place rules. Take it from your friendly, neighborhood FedEx guy!"}
{"text":"First time visitor. Enticed by a flier for a bogo burger. Service was excellent. Very friendly and welcoming order taker  Ambiance is quite nice.  Now on to the reason for visiting this establishment... FOOD: Very underwhelmed.  If they are competing with Wendy's, Burger King, and such they win on most counts except price of course. But if their true competition is Red Robin, Bad Daddy's even Five Guys they lose on all counts.  I ordered the Bacon Cheesy and found the dominate taste was bun. Burger was very undersized for the bun. Bun was so coated on the top I had to put a napkin over the bun prior to cutting the sandwich in half. Tasted no cheese... little bacon. I accepted all standard accompaniments offered, i.e. mustard, catsup, mayo... it they were present they were the blandest versions of these products I've ever tasted...or not. Ordered the large fries which comes in the small size cup. Mostly full of 3/4 to 1\" size fries. Not the best for catsup dipping unless you require your fingers to be a part of each bite. Bottom line... way overpriced...far too many much better places to dine in the same neighborhood. Thank God I had the coupon!"}
{"text":"Nothing short of amazing!! Customer service and food is never disappointing. Definitely the BEST burger in town!"}
{"text":"Gourmet burger joints are everywhere now and because it is no longer unique I am basing this revue in service an quality control. Food is good but this is my second visit and they forgot the milkshake I ordered and when I went to ask them about it they made up an excuse that they were swamped instead of just making me one. The place wasn't at all busy either. The first visit my girlfriend medium burger was rare. Never had problems at burger Fi, Habit Burger, or Five Guys. Maybe it's just this locations management."}
{"text":"These burgers are probably the next best thing to using a charcoal grill at home! They're delicious and come out timely. The fries are PERFECT. Also, the many sauces they have to choose from is cool; I love the Thai Ketchup and Ragin' Cajun. I could eat here every day. Also, the staff is always so friendly."}
{"text":"Great burger place! Love their gluten free options and everything we've ordered has been great. Food comes out quickly and staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Great burger.  I ordered the Tex-mex burger and it was cooked perfect.  The Gouda cheese made the burger.  I suggest trying the chipotle mayo on everything."}
{"text":"YOL (Yummmmmmm Out Loud) Black & Blue YOL! Yelp always wants you to be wordy, but the above says it all!"}
{"text":"Probably wouldn't come back. A burger itself was 8$, fries were 3$, and a shake was 5$. Such a huge price for something completely okay, with a small portion. Service was awful, burgers came out to us 1 at a time for me and my buddies, so by the time we were ready to eat the person who got their food first was out of luck."}
{"text":"Best burger i had in months.try the thai , apple cider and barbeque sauces next time you go there!"}
{"text":"In Charlotte you basically have limited choices for awesome burgers.  If you follow my reviews you know my thoughts on Bad Daddy's (Yuck) and there's Five Guys.    BURGER 21 lays the smackdown on all of them.  Hands down heavy weight champion of the world type smackdown.  We showed up right when they opened on Sunday morning and were immediately impressed with all of the choices.  I orders the Tex Mex Haystack on the recommendation of the nice young lady behind the counter. Applewood-smoked bacon, Gouda, guacamole, onion strings, chipotle-jalapeño sauce, toasted brioche bun...who the heck puts Gouda on a burger?  THIS GUY from now on it was just yummy.  Another thing to point out is that the \"Bun : Burger : Topping\" ration was simply perfect.  The burger didn't over power or over juice the bun where it fell apart and you had to relinquish a man card by eating it with a fork.  They also allow you to choose the way you want the burger cooked so I chose Med Rare the way a burger should be.  They also have a multitude of sauces including the Thai Ketchup with was awesome with fries.  I'm glad I found you Burger 21 and will be back.  I do realize that location has been cursed for quite some time but hopefully the sheeple that are eating terrible burger across the street smarten up and check you out."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Burger 21 last summer while vacationing in Orlando, so we were thrilled to see one open up not far from us in Charlotte. As with the Florida location, the burgers were terrific, and a great selection of local beers (NoDa Ramble On Red ... awesome!) was a big plus. And don't get me started on the delicious desserts ...  But as good as the meal was, the wait time was HORRIBLE. Our burgers were delivered in fairly short order, but after we went back to the counter to order ice cream, it took nearly 30 MINUTES for three sundaes to make it to our table. And THAT was only after we pestered the waiter to check on them before our kids started having a meltdown. From our vantage point, it looked like they had ONE guy making all the ice cream AND answering the phone to deal with take-out orders. Not really his fault, but management needs to figure that one out ... FAST.  So, Burger 21 COULD be one of the best burger/beer/sundae joints in Charlotte. If they can just get the service issues worked out. Until then, I'm docking them a star."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place but we opted to try it out on our quest for an amazing burger. Success! The burgers were amazing and the shakes delicious. Not a fan of the skinny French fries, but to each their own.  I got the loaded spud burger and it was awesome! Next time I'll remove the scallions but the sauce was soooooo good!"}
{"text":"First time here - we were greeted by 2 counter girls who explained how the menu worked. They were kind but after a while the one girl was just obnoxious and started to get really irritating. (Tip: Sit as far away from the counter as possible!) first impression: seemed like a mix between 5 guys and burgatory.  We decided on a regular cheese burger, Mediterranean chicken burger & the cheese and ale fries.  The regular cheese burger was good - five guys & burgatory are better. There aren't many topping options (I was offered ketchup mustard or mayo in addition to tomato and lettuce.)  Mediterranean burger was also good. Chicken is freshly ground instead of like a frozen patty. Still would have liked more topping options (pickle?)  Fries themselves were uneventful (think McDonald's). The beer cheese came on the side with bacon & chives. It was really good.  I think people came to our table 5 or 6 times and asked us how our meal was - it was nice the first couple times but after awhile got annoying. It seemed like they were constantly in a hurry to take things off our table to get it clean.  We decided to share one milkshake (Candy Cane). Sizes are really small and prices are a little steep. Milkshakes take a really long time to make (we were told 5 minutes - took more like 15) so order those half way through your meal if you don't want to wait.  We sat the bar area near the milkshakes to wait because it was taking really long and one the employees implied that we couldn't sit there if we didn't have a to-go order. WOW.  The milkshake had no taste. Absolute waste of money. \"Hand crafted\" is definitely the wrong word. Go to burgatory - they're on a whole different level. Glad we only wasted money on one.   2 burgers, 1 cheese & ale fry basket, 2 drinks & 1 milkshake: $31.  Overall, average at best. There's better burger joints out there (five guys, burgatory) and I would put this right up next to McDonald's (actually, I would prefer McDonald's most times.) Won't be back especially after the woman at the end."}
{"text":"I've thought hard whether to write a review, because some secrets should remain secrets   This is a gem of place for real Burger fanatics. The atmosphere is very relaxed however service is good.  Fries were very crispy and baked in new oil, so not greasy, not too much salt etc. the fries are how they are supposed to be. The variety in sauces they offer are stored at right way and at right temperature avoiding bacterias etc. Burger 21 provides small containers so you can pick the sauce you want in the quantity you want.  The Burger was fabulous with premium beef and all fresh ingredients.  For sure I will be back"}
{"text":"Great burger joint!  Staff is young but attentive and trained well.  Food is great! Food is fresh and made everyday.  I love the turkey burgers. The shake of the month is fantastic!  Sydney M. is so kind and helpful. She will go out of her way to assist you with your needs."}
{"text":"I know everyone always wants to find a hole in the wall that is soooooo special and they have the best this and that, etc.    Well, sometimes, a chain restaurant, Like Burger 21, is the not so subtle hole in the wall.    It is probably the best, consistent burger you can find in town.  Fries are shoe string and pretty good,  beware, a small order of fries is plenty.  They have a lot of different sauces, ( I will admit, most taste like some sort of mayo based sauce with some spices, but hey, its still not bad).  all in all, this is my go to burger joint."}
{"text":"First thing to know is that you place your order at the counter before sitting down. This is something I wasn't aware of until walking in. Came here after a work conference in Ballantyne and we wanted a tasty, juicy burger and this spot delivered. So not knowing what to get and leaning on someone behind me suggesting the sliders an audible was called at the counter and one that was converted to a touchdown at that. The lady at the counter suggested to try the Bayou Burger because we like spicy. This was the featured burger at the the time and feel like it came straight out of Louisiana.  Comes with andouille sausage and on a turkey burger (yes I like I this turkey burger) , blackened grilled shrimp, remoulade , sirachi, and I even liked the Cajun Coke slaw . All comes on a brioche bun.  So good and did I mention that 5 out of 6 got this burger and all happy about the choice .    So they also have a sauces bar with many different sauces that I recommend.  Get the Cajun one for your fries.  Also if you order fries you may opt for the cheese dip on the side which is ok but a little runny .  All in all a great experience"}
{"text":"The black bean veggie burger, as ubiquitous as it is, is very good here. The chipotle mayo and the addition of the avocado and salsa send this burger over the top. The fries, either regular or sweet potato, are superb--nice and thin so they get really crispy. Although oddly enough the regular fries taste a lot like McDonald's fries. Hmmm... :-) I've also had their strawberry milkshake. I swear I could drink one everyday they are that good.  I've gone to this place as much as twice a week, so this has become my new go-to place when I'm too lazy to pack my lunch. The staff is ALWAYS super nice and get my order right every time. A great place to visit!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a burger joint that backs up what they are in their amazing burgers. They are delicious, mouth watering and big burgers. I was hooked on the first visit and will continue to go."}
{"text":"The food is good, so that is important.  The menu offers nice choices, and the quality is excellent.  I like the \"gourmet\" sauce bar.  But the prices are simply too high for a fast casual concept.  I can get great burgers for less at a growing number of places.  Or I can get equivalent burgers (or better) for the same price - and be served by a server in a much nicer atmosphere.  For this reason, I don't see myself eating here again.  To pay $16 for a burger, fries and a drink at lunch time, to sit in a booth like I'm at a fast food restaurant is simply not OK.  If it were $9, ok.  But with the many options that we have today in this genre, this place simply does not justify its price point."}
{"text":"Yummy, can't wait to go back & try a different burger, maybe one day I'll have room to try a shake too!"}
{"text":"We were craving for burgers so instead of having five guys I said I'll try this new Burger 21. We ordered to-go one cheesy bacon and the other philly cheesesteak burger. The cheese steak was a little bit salty and the cheesy bacon was OK. Not really something to rave about but they were decent burgers. I like the sweet potato fries but the french fries tasted like they were fried on a-million-times used oil. Now here's the punch. After eating our tummy became bloated. And then the nightmare began. I got diarrhea and was up all night going back and forth to the bathroom. My partner who had the cheese steak was throwing up. That burger made us sick and I'm sure it's something from the meat. So no more Burger 21 for me and maybe for you, too. Think twice."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant to EVER work for....food is prepped unsanitary. No gloves and bare hands. Management is great but the owner is a total d-bag!! Treats employees like dogs and underpays then horribly, explains why employees are always in such bad moods. Would NEVER recommend this place to anyone....can you say diabetes and food poisoning!"}
{"text":"Had hi hopes when looking at the menu. Sandwich was very small for the price and barely warm. French fries were undercooked and soggy. Sandwich, fries and a small drink came to $13.80.  Never again."}
{"text":"Craft burger joints seem to be on the rise nowadays. What makes this experience different from the \"big box\" franchise chains like Five Guys, In 'N Out, and Smash Burger? Not much I suppose, but Burger 21 (B21) stands out a bit in my mind for a few reasons.   First, the decor/setup is nicely done. The interior is highly modern and clean. It's not cluttered but yet can comfortably seat variously sized parties. B21 has a hand washing station in the middle of the restaurant. Now, on paper, this sounds a little strange but I really do feel like ALL burger (or finger food based) joints should utilize this concept! The station was kept very clean, in the 45 minutes I was at the restaurant I saw employee visit twice to tidy it up. But what a great way to sanitize before you start touching your food.  Second, the separate \"stations\" was a cool idea and it worked. There's a dipping sauce station for your fries. Yes, there's even a toasted marshmallow dipping sauce for those sweet potato fries-- YUM! There's a specialty beverage station (aside from your standard fountain drinks) where you can order custom milkshakes or beer/wine. The beer options are bottle only (no draught) but they had a decent selection of craft brews to select from.  Lastly, the quality of food was above average in my opinion. The meat used to make my swiss cheese burger was fresh, cooked perfectly and laid inside a super-fresh gluten-free bun (made locally). And the toppings weren't overdone. You know how sometimes eating a burger requires a wet suit with 3 rools of paper towels to clean up everything that fall OUT of the burger? Well, not with B21- my craft burger had the perfect amount of toppings and every ounce was consumed without major spillage. A plus for me!  There are not a lot of menu options here- maybe 5 types of burger (standard, with cheese, with bacon, with mushrooms, etc.) and I believe I saw a chicken burger. There was a small menu for the kiddos- junior burgers, chicken fingers, etc. The french fries were the thin, crispy ones (sort of Fat Burger-esque) and they were delicious. For 2 cheese burgers, 2 fries, and 2 fountain drinks the damage was just under $25, so that seemed a little pricey to me. Maybe this is more of a treat or a break from the chains- but not something I'd go to every time I craved a burger. Overall, the experience was very positive. Friendly staff, good food, and a few niche ideas and it was great! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Stopped in a whim and I'll have to update when I comeback and try more.  I had a bacon cheeseburger with fries.   It's the first burger I've had that looked like burgers on commercials on TV. Stacked high and had great flavor.    Easily a top ten burger I've had in the greater phoenix area.  I'll definite come back with friends to try more items"}
{"text":"I noticed an earlier reviewer had mentioned that the staff were all teenagers, and it made me wonder when I received my overcooked burger....is the cook also a teenager?  Teenage staff equals fast food levels of customer service, which kind of conflicts with the whole gourmet burger thing this restaurant seems to be shooting for...  My patty was crunchy on the outside, overdone on the inside, but was stil dripping juice out of the burger.  Not sure how that happens, unless they are adding Au Jou in the back where the cooking takes place.  For average service and high prices, I wasn't satisfied.  I will probably not go back."}
{"text":"Burger cooked perfectly, but a little too salty for my liking. Nothing too spectacular about the fries either. This would not be my first, second, or third choice when it comes to a good quality burger."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Touch too expensive in comparison to eating at a full restaurant with table side service around the area. Hate for yet another place to leave the Seville so I really hope it makes it. Giving this 4 stars instead of 3.5 which I hope helps them. Never know if owners actually listen to Yelp...they should.    Advice.  Cheese and Ale sauce sounds great but WAY too thin.  Please thicken it up.  It's like water really  Use iceberg for skinny wrap. The romaine didn't work.   Fries are not crispy enough."}
{"text":"We had the cinco burger which came with jalapeno, Pico de Gallo, and guac.  My nephew had the burger of the month which came with bacon, avocado and a fried egg.  The were tasty and the best part was the sauce station:  multiple flavors of ketchup, mayo, bbq! The s'more shake was amazing and I recommend sharing it!  Nothing special about the sweet potato fries, but they were good too."}
{"text":"I find their mushroom burger one of the best I've eaten.  I am a personal fan of sauces and really like the fact that Burger 21 has a great array of sauces available.  Personally, I like the Rajin' Cajun."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time today. Pretty good.  The burgers are nice and juicy - however just a bit under seasoned.  The B-Sauced Bar is great.   I had the PB&Chocolate Malt - very good, but I think they forget the malt.  BF got the Banana's Foster shake - three words....TWO DIE FOR!!!!!   I like it because they allow dogs on the patio - always looking for places the allow pets.   Would go again.  Wish they had grilled chicken instead of ground chicken for 'burgers'.   Wish they had misters on the patio - need them in AZ.  Will again soon with the pup-hopefully they will have misters by then."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong , but nothing special.  The selling point here seems to be the 12 ketchups and sauces you can add to your burger.   The bun wasn't the greatest the night we were there.  Fries were good.  We didn't have a shake, but they looked very good."}
{"text":"This is a nice family friendly restaurant, clean and friendly customer service.  The food, for my family was under seasoned, the kids didn't even finish their 2 chicken fringes.  I had the Philly burger which in hind sight is a cheeseburger with sautéed onions, nothing special there and definitely no flavor, my husband had the tex mex and well, he would of preferred ruby Tuesdays.  Needless to say, this is not a place we will be running back to for our burger fix."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant wasn't overcrowded. The staff was extremely friendly. As first timers we asked for suggestions. The guy was eager top tell is about his best sellers. My boyfriend got the tex mex and I ordered the bacon cheese burger. The guys also told me I could add and egg to any burger on the menu. So I did! We ordered fries with a side of the cheese ale sauce. We made great choices! Everything was amazing! The sauce bar is what makes this place stand out. They have close to 10 different sauces and you can try them all! One other key ticket for me was that they had local beer on tap. I picked up a JAM session from Noda Brewery.   All I can say is go here asap!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place, but it didn't match my expectations.   I got the loaded spud burger (sans bacon because I don't eat pork). It was just okay. The scallion cream was pretty bland. The potato crisp thing was like a tepid McDonalds hash brown. The brioche was super greasy and made a giant mess. The burger itself was also greasy.   However, I loved the fries. They were incredibly crispy and delicious. I also really enjoyed the bananas foster shake. These were five-star items for sure.   Still, I can't give a high review when the main component of my dish just wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a lazy memorial day holiday. The decor was cool and impressive, i ordered a spicy thai shrimp burger and the husband ate the Mediterranean chicken burger. Must say was pretty impressed by the clean presentation and moreover the shrimp burger was mind blowing. However the chicken Mediterranean burger was a little bland, but pretty flavorful. Will surely mark this as a visit again place."}
{"text":"I am impressed.  I received a free burger with the purchase of an equal or greater cost burger coupon in the mail so I decided to give them a try.  Seeing no way to redeem my coupon on the website I called in my order.  The person on the other end of the phone asked if I'd prefer my fries to be cooked after I arrived since they are shoestring fries and might get cold otherwise.  What a thoughtful recommendation, yes please!  I got the BBQ bacon cheeseburger which seems almost identical to what Red Robin calls their Whisky River BBQ bacon burger.  No matter, I didn't want unlimited fries anyway.  I asked my ole lady what she thought after our meal and she commented she couldn't recall having a better burger recently.   I will be back.  YUM.  Maybe today.  :)"}
{"text":"Just tried this place and it was soooo good. I'm super picky about burgers because any one can make a burger but to have flavor and good meat is the challenge ... This place passes my test! Blows Smash Burger out of the water. The Thai ketchup and toasted marshmallow for fries was delicious. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Not bad, not spectacular, but okay burger place.  The best part was the sauce bar, Thai ketchup and chipotle mayo were awesome.  Some of the sauces are gluten free too, and they have a gluten free menu.  I had gluten free Shroom burger, good burger and mushrooms, but gluten free bun was awful, crumbly and dry, no flavor.  Need a new supplier for their gluten free buns, there MUST be better ones than that!  Fries were average, skinny, crisp, good fluffy inside though.  Tables clean, they came to clear our empty baskets quickly.  Water bottles at 2$ are a rip off. I mean come on, really?"}
{"text":"Decent. Nothing special to see here. I don't know if the TV menu was just not turned on or what, but it seemed kind of dumb to have you walk right up to the register as soon as you walk in not sure how to order.  The cashier just says grab a menu and look through it then order.  Mind you there was a TV behind her not even on. I assume that is normally the menu.  Now onto the food. The burger was above average. The fries were tasty. I tried the sweet potato fries and the regular ones. I liked both. I really enjoyed it. The presentation was great.  The price was a little high for what it actually is. Personally I would much rather go to In-n-out and pig out for more than half the price, forget the presentation.  My fiance had a shake and she said it was really good. Overall it was a decent experience. At least the food was good and came out quick. I am not sure if this place will last though."}
{"text":"I ordered a bbq bacon cheeseburger.  My wife and daughter ordered cheeseburgers. We ordered a basket of fries. My daughter and I ordered shakes.  I'll start there. The shakes were good, but not good enough to bring me back.  The fries were also decent.  Our burgers were ordered medium and they came rare. They were falling apart. The manager offered to re-cook them but it wasn't worth the hassle. The only good thing about the burger was the bun. Tasteless.  There were 3 half eaten burgers left. Trust me, we don't leave food, so that should tell you how we felt.  All the people were nice, and it seemed clean, but there are too many places that are much better."}
{"text":"Great taste and great family friendly atmosphere. Sauce bar provides variety to spice things up."}
{"text":"Food here is great. By far, the skinny is the best turkey burger I've ever had. It is so flavorful and far from dry. I like the different sauces they have available. My favorites are the Thai ketchup and the Cajun sauce. My husband orders regular beef hamburgers and loves them. We order the chicken strips for my son. They're really good! The restaurant is clean and aesthetically pleasing. The staff is attentive and very helpful in getting us settled at our table with our son."}
{"text":"Price is on point for the area, quality and temp of food, timely service and recommendations from the staff!  The strawberry milkshake is #1. You can taste the chunks of strawberries throughout the shake.  The OMG!! Burger cannot be conquered in one sitting.. get a box.   The Chicken Marsala burger was recommended and stood up the expectation of excellence.  The sauce poured over made it simply amazing and is comparable to Marsala sauce in an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm so torn writing this review. This place has so much going for them. The location is great! It's next door to Paradise and other popular eateries. The decor is vibrant and inviting. It's like a modern day diner. You walk in and the girls take your order there. They have lots of recommendations for you and will answer lots of questions if you have. They are pretty patient. The menu offers many choices and unique options in my opinion. I do think it's a little pricey. For my son and I it usually runs us usually $20 and he eats off the kids menu. It takes about 7-10 mins to get your food. I have been here twice. The first time I got the bacon cheeseburger which they told me they cook the burgers medium well not medium. Well I ordered my burger medium and well honestly it came partially still mooing. The burger itself was great and full of flavor minus the mishap. I did order the gluten free bun and it was great. Also with side of half and half fries which I'll get back too. Second time I ordered the spicy shrimp burger. It was ok...tasty but ok. This time my bun crumbled in my hand. I think it was old. This my friends took away a star. Again another basket of half and half of fries and the same thing as the first time. They were so dry. Even with sauce bar it was dry as a dry wedding! I don't get it. For a burger joint French try's have to be on point! This took away my last star. So I wanted to love this place so bad. I'll try it again and we'll see!"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place since it opened and was so sad it was so disappointing! Medium burger was served rare, bun was so soggy it was inedible and parsley fries were bland. Next time I'll go to Five Guys"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm not a burger  lover but this place is about to make me one. And the shakes are to die for. I had to cut myself off from this place because it was turning into an addiction. Keep up the amazing customer service team."}
{"text":"My hubby and I were heading to have lunch at Qdoba. When we got there- Surprise!!!  It was now a place called Burger 21. We had never eaten at a Burger 21 so we thought we should try it.  Inside the restaurant is decorated with a very modern flair. I really liked it. There is a small area to order, a small milkshake bar area, a condiment and fountain drink bar along with booths and tables. We went to the desk to order. The offer a lot-burgers, dogs, salads, and milkshakes. I decided to try the \"Bacon Cheesy\" burger and my hubby ordered the \"Spicy Thai Shrimp\" burger. We each ordered a soda and we ordered a large fry to share. Our total was $25. We thought that was a bit pricy. Once you order you sit at a table and they bring you your food.  When the food arrived they had made the wrong burger for me. Instead of \"the Big Cheesy\" I was given the \"BBQ Bacon\" burger. I like BBQ sauce so I ate it instead of sending it back. The burger was very good. It had lettuce, tomato, bacon, cheddar cheese, onion straws, and BBQ sauce. It was pink in the middle. (They asked me when I ordered if that was ok. I said yes.). It was better than a fast food burger but not as good as a Burgatory burger.  My husband's burger was a fried shrimp patty, lettuce, tomato, Sriracha aioli, sesame Thai slaw, and pure Sriracha. However the shrimp burger was NOT spicy at all.  The French fries were more like McD's and you have the option of getting sweet potato fries or a mix of both.  I ordered an Oreo milkshake to go. It was a very creamy shake and I enjoyed it.  There were no garbage cans but we felt awkward leaving our garbage on the table. One of the ladies had come by our table and had picked up my stuff when I was done, and a different lady picked up my husband's but we needed to throw our cups away. My husband ended up throwing his away in a trash can behind the counter. He didn't go behind the cabinet. You could reach it from the side of the cabinet.  This is just a weird experience. It's almost like if you are going to order your food at a counter you need to be able to dispose of it. OR have a wait staff person come to your table and take your order and also remove your garbage. Plus there was a tip jar at the register. We did tip but again it was awkward. Also when we first got there a few employees were at the counters. Then there were no employees at all out front. That's why we had to find a garbage can on our own.  I don't think it was a great enough experience to try a second time."}
{"text":"21 different burgers with a variety of protein choices, fries, and milk shakes what could go wrong. On my first trip not much. I had the bacon cheesy burger and fries. My daughter had the grilled cheese off the kids menu which used slider buns for the bread and it was delicious!   There are a number of dipping sauces to choose from for the fries or to add to your burger. Next time I'll get the sweet potato fries so I can try the toasted marshmallow sauce with them.   The kids lived their shakes too. Service was quick. Of course with all these fast casual places where you order at the counter and pay, get your own drink etc what the heck do you tip?"}
{"text":"The first visit to Burger 21 was fantastic. Top notch customer service and delicious, juicy burgers. We ordered the Black & Bleu and Tex-Mex Haystack burgers. The combination of rich bleu cheese and salty/smoky bacon on the Black & Bleu was awesome. Definitely a heavy burger though, a good one to split with someone. The Tex-Mex Haystack was the favorite of the night. The guacamole tasted fresh and the flavor combinations were spot on. We also tried both traditional and sweet potato fries. Both seasoned well and cooked perfectly.   The shakes are hands-down the best in the area! A-mazing. We had the bananas foster and chocolate malted milk ball. These shakes are what dreams are made of! Delicious and not overly sweet with the flavors really carrying through. And there wasn't any artificiality to the flavors.   The second visit was disappointing. This time we tried the traditional fries with the cheese & ale sauce. It came out quickly and it was delicious. The sauce was a great consistency, not too runny or heavy. Our order was slower to come out and when it did finally reach our table it was the wrong burger. The staff were quick to help but then we waited another 25 minutes for the right burger. At this point we had eaten all the fries and sauce and decided the burger was a lost cause. I went to the counter to get a refund for the burger, at which time a waitress brought over a to-go container which supposedly had our forgotten burger in it. The staff did go out of their way to make up for our disappointment. They gave us coupons for our next visit and voided our entire transaction for this visit while offering sincere apologies. To top the experience off, when we got home we found out the burger in the container was also wrong! lol. But our first experience with this place was so good and they were very genuine in their attempt to make up for this experience that we will be returning for a 3rd visit, at which time I'll write an update/follow-up review."}
{"text":"Why I love this place... the condiment bar duh!!!! Burger 21 has an amazing self serve condiment bar located right after the cash registers and it gives me life every time I visit. The sauce choices are all great with my favorites being Thai ketchup, Raging Cajun, Toasted Marshmallow and Ranch (a condiment staple and this is a \"good\" ranch not one of those stale kind of ranches).   On this visit I got the Buffalo chicken burger no tomato sub red onion and half and half fries. My mom got the burger 101 and my niece kids cheeseburger. My burger was delicious. The ranch dressing, blue cheese crumbles and Frank's red hot sauce was a great addition to the buffalo chicken burger. I could only eat half the burger after eating the fries.   They delivered our fries out before our burgers (the burgers were still cooking) and I really appreciated that. We were starving plus that allowed us time to eat the fries while they were good and hot and then enjoy the burgers will they were hot.   All of the employees were very helpful and polite. The atmosphere was nice and the place stayed packed with customers.   Burger 21  14825 Ballantyne Village Way Ste 160 Charlotte, NC 28277 Friday January 12, 2018 1:30pm"}
{"text":"DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE UP! The other reviews do not do this place justice.  After living in the Orlando area for almost 2 years and moving back home to the South Hills, I randomly searched up the closest Burger21 to me. I was super excited to see that they were opening up one on McKnight road. Even though it's a small drive, I knew it would be totally worth it.  The girl at the counter was so sweet. I saw her explain the menu perfectly a couple times to other people, but I didn't need the run around. I was just ready for a buffalo chicken burger and some ale sauce fries. I gave the tip jar a five because I already knew how great this was.  Thank Jesus I wasn't let down. My boyfriend is a super picky eater and he loved his bacon cheeseburger. My buffalo chicken burger was on point. My boyfriend fell in love with the ale fries. Amazing. He wants me to make them but it's just a better reason to visit.  Every single person in there was smiling. Some of the other reviews said the people were obnoxious... Well, wouldn't you rather have an excited young staff instead of a depressed group of kids?   Burger21 is amazing. It's a fast food joint serving gourmet burgers."}
{"text":"Great burgers cooked to perfection.  My husband and I split the mushroom burger and sweet potatoe fries.  Both were excellent and the service was superb!  They have really great ketchups - the thai ketchup was delicious.   Gourmet burgers with reasonable prices -  we will definitely return.  Nice to be able to sit outdoors."}
{"text":"Just tried Burger 21 finally. Walked in at approximately 8:30pm and was greeted immediately and seated. I ordered the black and blue burger since I love blue cheese crumbles on my burgers. It came out 10 minutes later and looked really good, but did it taste as good as it looked??  The fries look and taste similar to McDonald's fries. They weren't special, but pretty solid. What made them were dipping them into one of many sauces. This place has a sauce bar including rajun Cajun sauce, honey mustard, chipotle mayo, Thai ketchup, ranch dressing and even a marshmallow sauce in addition to your regular ketchup and mustard. I liked the Thai and honey mustard but rajun Cajun was my favorite. Fries came in a big cup and were plenty big enough in size even though I got a small.  Onto the burger. It came with ketchup, mustard, lettuce, tomato, pickle, blue cheese crumbles, and bacon. It was cooked perfect to my liking and was so flavorful with every bite. I really enjoyed it even more than Burgatory. This place blows Five Guys away too. Waitress was friendly and fast. Even the other waitresses came to talk to me.   My only negative is it was super hot inside. Maybe the air condition wasn't working or they turned it off because it was later in the night. I couldn't imagine it being like that with heavy lunch and dinner crowds.  My bill came to $11.75 and I left the waitress $3.00. Will definitely return and recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Pretty hip spot for a burger joint, but overall cool.  I came with my 2 sisters to check this place out.  Overall, the place reminds me of a Smashburger, but unfortunately without a smash!  I ordered the Bacon Cheese burger while my sisters order the cheesy 4 pack and the Cinco burger.  The Cinco burger came with jalapenos, gaucamole, salsa, jack cheese, your burger fixings on a sesame bun.  Overall, a good looking burger and my sister was delighted.  I'm a bacon burger snob!  Mines came with the fixings, applewood bacon, american cheese on a brioche bun.  In the end, I thought it was good, but nothing really stood out for me.  I guess what's really cool about this place is the sauces available to your choosing; Thai ketchup, toasted marshmellows, Ragin Cajun, Apple Cider, etc.    The place itself pushes for a modern flare with a young vibrant service crowd.  In the end, it's a cool place to hangout, but didn't really captivate me! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, very simple decor and styling. Great outdoor seating. Surprisingly good craft beer selection. French fries were great. My kids loved the large choice of dipping sauces"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  The food is fresh, hot, and melt in your mouth.  The burgers are not too big....they are tender, juicy and flavorful.  I don't get the negative review about the brioche bun being the highlight of the burger. it is fresh and grilled and complements the burger perfectly.   The fries are never going to create a frenzy but they are always fresh cooked and hot and crisply!  I love this place.....you will miss a great burger if you don't try it!"}
{"text":"Burger 21 is a great burger place. I always get a different burger I go, and I never am disappointed by them. The black and blue burger is my favorite burger and the sweet potato fries are delicious. Their homemade shakes are amazing as well and if you need them to split the shake for two they will. Every month they have a special burger as well as shakes. I would recommend this if you want a good burger and fries."}
{"text":"Non-burger review: ahi tuna burger. It was okay, but the tuna patty was cooked too well done and came out a bit dry. The sauces were interesting, but, like previous reviews have mentioned, just taste like mayo mixed with seasoning. Fries were also pretty average. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again but wouldn't mind if I found myself in the area."}
{"text":"Burgers are overpriced for this style.  I think 6.99 for an average Size burger.  Fries are extra more than 2 dollars.  My teenage son's burger was way underdone. We asked for well done and it came out mostly red inside and dark outside. I noticed after he took a couple bites.  We had them make another. The same thing happened a second time after waiting the 6 minutes or do promised by the owner. He did give us a 5 dollar token for our troubles. I got a Cobb salad. It was average size, not huge for I believe 6.99 or so. Meh. Not impressed.  Might just go get a free milkshake with our 5 dollars."}
{"text":"VERY tasty burger. Very juicy or if you want, a little less juicy, and messy. Always crowded so there is some wait time for the meal. Grab a lot of napkins you'll need them. and the price was like a buck more than my double cheese burger from the 5 dudes .....so this place has my vote for better burger joint!!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with my first visit to Burger 21.   The burger was simply awesome.   The beef was juicy and flavorful with a great bun and fresh toppings.   The portion was just right and not Fred Flintstone sized like you see at other burger joints.   The fries were simple and delicious and the sauce bar was a nice addition.    My son had a small shake that looked spectacular.     The place is very clean with modern decor.   I like that they had a sink to wash your hands in the main dining  area.   We spent $25 for two burgers, two fries, a shake, and a regular drink.  Maybe a little expensive, but worth the premium in my opinion.   We will certainly visit again."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by Burger 21. The food is relatively inexpensive and the burgers are a decent size. I got the Turkey Cobb Burger and was really happy with my choice. The fries weren't anything super exciting but there is a sauce bar so it was fun to try them with all of the different sauces. We also got a chocolate milkshake to go and let me tell it will change your life!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Burger21 for a quick dinner on Sunday at 6:00. The first thing that was impressive was how clean the entire place was from the floor to the tables and counters all spotless. The food was good had the standard burger with bacon and cheese and the wife had the burger sliders. The food had good taste wasn't overly greasy \" it a burger some grease is expected\" and the shakes were tasty. Would definitely stop in for a quick bite or when the craving hits for a burger."}
{"text":"We liked it - but it's not what we expected ... The staff are pretty young and seem like they'd rather NOT be working.... The food it's was tasty and the fries were great. The sauces were unique and worth trying ONCE... The milkshakes rocked. I'd like it better if this was more of a sit down kind of place - we weren't crazy about the order, dine and dash - as the tables sit dirty for awhile and it creates a bit of a back up on the busy nights. We'll be back - but probably on a week night."}
{"text":"Burgers were cooked to order (medium = pink in the middle). Very juicy, and well seasoned patty. The toasted brioche bun held the burger together nicely. The fries were fries, not very salty which was nice. The cheese and ale sauce was delicious. Loved the espresso milkshake, but because we didn't get a fountain drink and we were sat we did not know about the sauce bar. (Not mentioned/offered to us, because we surely would have checked it out!)"}
{"text":"Gluten free buns for the burgers, great fries,   And outdoor seating. Prices are fair and on the 21st of each moth they donate a percentage of their take to a local charity."}
{"text":"This is the second time my wife and I, have come here to eat and the food is just so good. the staff is just great.if anyone is looking for some great food try this place out."}
{"text":"My 10 year old has a wheat allergy and he loves this place! He was all smiles and definitely NOT missing those fast food places (I can't bear to call that crap food)."}
{"text":"Food is just okay but the help...Fire everyone. It feels like it's everyone's first day. I keep hoping the food and service will get better but it hasn't and likely won't. Also, every one of the 4 or 5 times I've been here, my burger has never been cooked as ordered. Every single time. Sorry Burger21, I'm done."}
{"text":"I actually like this place! It's not exactly simple burgers but also not the most gourmet burgers, these are in the middle of the spectrum.   There's a good variety of burgers. If you don't like beef, no worries! They have seafood, chicken, etc. I personally loved the ahi tuna burger but if you're someone who loves to Instagram their food- the burger itself didn't look very appealing.   Some other pros: 1. Sauce bar! They have so many unique sauces. They even have a toasted marshmallow one but I'm pretty sure someone told me it's for the sweet potato fries. 2. They have milk shakes here! Love the concept of the place.  3. Food comes fast.  4. Check your mail for coupons! Sometimes I get BOGO and it's definitely worth it.  Cons: 1. Burger doesn't come with fries...that always bums me out.  That's about it! I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Eh.  I had the 4 pack sliders.  Decent.   Lots of dipping sauces for your fries.  A friendly staff.  I would go back.  I expected more with the hype.  A friend had the turkey patty salad, she thought it was good.  I can't imagine.  They do have big salads."}
{"text":"The place is super modern and clean and the menu seems promising. Burgers and fries were separate so it was 14 bucks for a burger, fries and drink. Meh. Fries and burger are good but the burgers were incredibly greasy. It was just okay overall. I would suggest giving it a try though."}
{"text":"Stop by just to get some fries for a snack. Then the wife and I decided to have early dinner. Liked how clean it was figured another burger place. This place was amazing. Great service. I asked for something not on the menu to add with my dinner. She said it's not listed but I will do it. What a great attitude. Got our food very timely and fresh. This was absolutely the best burger I ever had so tasty. My wife's chicken sandwich was fantastic as well. I am visiting from California on vacation and they could use some lessons on how to treat a customer. If I lived here I would visit regularly try this place out."}
{"text":"These are not go for a burger burgers these are good former burgers and the sauces for dipping the fries?! marshmallow? I actually loved it . I got more than 3 words review from my hubs who said it was a nice combination and the burgers were juicy. If i get more than it's good I'm happy.  My 10 year old enjoyed feeding us fry sauce combinations and devouring her burger which was messy but delicious! definitely a good break from cooking dinner without sinking to regular fast food fare.  Have to Add on the way out when kiddo wanted to take her shake but we needed a flat lid the staff was awesome about changing the cups out and getting us one with a lid. So helpful."}
{"text":"Burger 21 was great. The service was quick and friendly. I had the buffalo chicken tender sandwich and it was delicous. Great place. Sauce bar is great!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I was very impressed with this place. Sure, it's a burger joint, but they also have something for everyone, even the non-burger lovers. From sliders to massive, melty cheeseburgers, everything coming out of the kitchen looked great.   I ended up trying to be a little healthier on my trip (had enough red meat for a week) and opted for the buffalo chicken salad, and this salad was epic. First, the size alone was massive, but it wasn't just all lettuce. It was a even mixture of toppings, from buffalo chicken to avocados, they certainly didn't skimp. The boys I went with both got different sliders, and three was more than enough for them. They also got kids milkshakes, which were decadent in and of themselves. If your thinking of getting one, go for it!   Although I didn't get any fries, they have multiple dipping options, ranging well outside the normal ketchup/mustard range."}
{"text":"The food is not even that good. It's just your average burger and fries. But they charge like your eating Kobe beef. It's run by a bunch of unprofessional kids, that need training in customer service. The only good thing about this place is the sauce bar."}
{"text":"1st off you have to stand while you peruse the menu and then order. Having never been there, we choose a booth and took time to look over the items .. Our burgers arrived 1st with no sign of the shakes and fries . In fact we are our burgers and they still hadn't arrived . I took one bite of my OMG burger and it fell apart literally all over the plate . Definately didn't come out looking like the other pic on this website. My sons grilled cheese came with the bread inside out and not melted . Yuck. It was 56$ for three burgers , three shakes , one lb basket of fries and a kids meal with a shake . Honestly , comparing this to Burgatory is a slap in the face. Not even close ..see pics ..they are with the others up above .."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers & shakes!  The Cinco burger is my favorite...make sure you make it a double if you are starving!  The fries are fresh and they gave a sauce bar with difference dipping sauces to choose from.  The best part of the meal is the shake! My favorite is the banana foster milkshake and it comes with a creme brûlée banana slice as a garnish...YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"Great place! Saved my life on New Years Day - great service, good burgers and shakes. Loved the sweet fries option! Avoid the marshmallow sauce though.."}
{"text":"This is bar and none the best place to get a burger from in the entirety of Ballantine. I've been here many times and I always receive nice and quick service, great burgers with lots of flavor and an overall good trip that keeps me coming back, even if my burger gets the wrong temperature. That's the only problem that I could find."}
{"text":"Very slow. Take out. Chocolate shake looked beautiful and was very large but they absolutely ruined the best part by sprinkling brown powder all over the whipped cream. Gagged on it. Think it was sawdust. Fries...just so so and had a funny aftertaste. Cheeseburger, medium, ketchup only turned out undercooked throughout yet very crispy hard on one side. Cheese looked like a thin sheet of wax melted on top and the lettuce and tomato (I guess they don't do special orders?) made the bottom of the roll soggy. The dog loved it. Husband's BBQ burger was also very undercooked. Funny since it took so long to cook. Parking is also horrible. Not worth $23."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a review after my second visit.  New Years day, no one except employees were there and they still screwed it up.  I order the black and bleu burger for my second time.  This time they forgot to season the burger so it was pretty bland.  The bun appeared to be stale and cold as it was crumbling apart at the bottom making the burger messy to eat.  The guy at the counter who kept sneezing in his hand and wiping it on his jeans rung my daughters order up wrong so it had to be remade.  I didn't bother telling them about my burger because I knew the kids could not sit still much longer.    What irked me the most (besides the sneezing counter guy) was when I was ordering the food for the kids, I was offered fruit, applesauce, fries or sweet potato fries as their side options.  I picked sweet potato fries for both.  I was not informed that there was an up charge.  I didn't realize it until I checked my receipt.  That ticks me off to no end.  Bottom line, if you have a empty restaurant (and I mean empty) and a fully stocked up staff, nothing should go wrong.  This place is in a good area and the prices are high.  I probably won't return because I spent a good amount of money and got very little satisfaction."}
{"text":"Burgers are excellent.  They even have a shrimp burger which is awesome.   Only drawback for me are two simple fixes: a) it's too damn cold, especially for my 5 month year old, and b) sauce bar is cool but no trays to carry them on."}
{"text":"Burnt my burger to crisp tonight! Thought I was eating onions rings or french fries is how burnt it was. I had to throw half away. Has not happened in the past, so I am guessing either someone was not watching or was untrained. But probably wont be back since they served me something I think they should have known needed thrown in the trash."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times, got my burger order wrong twice. There's better places to spend $25 for 2 people to eat. I do like the option of turkey, chicken and veggie burgers."}
{"text":"Was shopping in the plaza this place is located and decided to stop in, because you can never go wrong with burger. Ordered a BBQ bacon cheeseburger and a small chocolate malted milk ball malt. Damn, the burger was really good. There is nothing worse than a BBQ burger where they get skimpy on the sauce and this one definitely doesn't do that. The malt was pretty damn good too, but I couldn't finish it, the burger was inhaled in record time. Check this place out if you get the chance."}
{"text":"Really good eats just wish they had better beer/ale options. I didn't get a milk shake but they must be good as everyone had them.    Try the apple cider ketchup. Yum"}
{"text":"Stopped by this neighborhood burger joint. A little refreshing decor, literally a couple of booths. Several tables with plastic chairs and some outdoor seating. A lot of patrons were gravitating toward the outdoor seating, pretty chilly temp inside.   I ordered the cheesy burger, fries and drink for a bit over $12. The fries are string like and the burger maybe a 1/3 pound. The burger was tasteless, bland.   Glad I tried this place but do not plan on dining here again. Real disappointed bland tasteless burger. Oh well!!!"}
{"text":"Noticed a new burger place so decided to give it a try. Loved that they also had a lot of non burger options. I have food allergies and was disappointed they didn't have a food allergy chart - try do have a gluten free menu but that doesn't help me because I'm allergic to dairy, sesame and egg. Took them a long time to go in back and check ingredient labels. Burger was good but my whole grain bun (the only option that fit my allergies) fell apart.  Fries were delicious. A little on the expensive side for what it was."}
{"text":"Long overdue review of my wife and I's favorite burger and shake dive in Charlotte. I'll make this easy for everyone. 1. The shakes are the best I have ever had 2. Their fries are solid which leads straight to 3. All of the dipping sauces for the fries 4. The Rajun Cajun dipping sauce 5. Every burger I have tried has never disappointed 6. The place is always clean 6. Service is always fast 7. The place is priced very reasonably...  What is their not to love about this place? Nothing."}
{"text":"First, I must start out by saying that I am extremely critical of Burger spots.  It feels like there are a million burger joints and I really think you need to stand out to get a 4 or 5 star review.  Having said that, allow me to tell you about my two trips to Burger 21.  First trip --  If you have a Tex/Mex Burger with onion rings, bacon, and bbq sauce... I am going to order it.  Period.  The picture of the Tex/Mex in the gallery is spot on.  They do an excellent job with cooking it as ordered and using nice and fresh buns.  The bun is half the burger and crucial. Overall, I would give this Tex/Mex burger a 6.9 out of 10.  The 6.9 is overwhelmingly decided on due to comparison with other burgers.  The burger at Bad Daddys and Cowbell Uptown blow this out of the water.    I was rather disappointed with the fries.  Now this may be just because I generally like more of a steak cut type of fry (or at least some body to the fry) but B21's were shoe string and rather plain.  To their credit, they do have a sauce stations and you can load up on variety of flavors.  I would suggest the rajin cajun sauce.  It's good!    Although, I couldnt get myself to order one of the milkshakes or floats, they looked BANGIN!  I would imagine it would rather difficult to not enjoy one of those.    Second trip --  I got the Tex/Mex burger another go around.  Hahaha.  What can I say.. I like bacon and bbq on my burger.. Sue me!  Overall, same review.  I wouldn't go as far as to say that I will definitely go back but if they keep sending me a buy one get one free burger coupon.. I will probably venture that way again.    Enjoy!  -Ian M."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place right here. #1 item is their choices of Condiments/sauces.   I got an Shroom burger, was cooked decent, good fixins fresh buns... Not over the top, but a tad better than most places.   Wife got a Chili dog, .. Was overboard, but she loved it as well.   Got 1/2 basket Fries 1/2 Sweet Potato fries, decent size n texture,  Tried almost all the sauces, and we tore up the Chipotle somethign sauce,, Chipotle n mayo? dunno, but was very good... yummm, Got a few other burger shops to try, to see which is the new go to place.."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a quick place to eat!  Burgers, chicken strips and shakes all exceeded expectations!"}
{"text":"I got a coupon in the mail for being a new resident of the area, it was for getting a free milkshake with the purchase of a burger.  I looked on their menu and was really impressed with their options, they have 2 vegetarian options, and a couple seafood and turkey burgers besides their beef options.  I chose the black bean burger, which had salsa, avocado, aoili, lettuce, and tomato on a whole wheat bun (it also comes with sourcream, but I didn't want that).  It was what you would call an upscale stacked burger, delicious!  The price was steep for a burger.. with tax it came to about $7 and some cents, I thought it would have came with fries, but you have to pay extra for those.  I wanted fries but they were an extra $3, so I declined.  I ate part of it while it was hot and the other half after work when it was cold, and the burger was excellent both hot/warm and cold.  Next for the milkshake I selected the seasonal Pumpkin or Pumpkin Pie milkshake, it was good also, but didn't taste much like pumpkin.. it tasted more like eggnog.. but it was good nonetheless.    The staff was friendly.  The food was good.  I would go back, especially if I had another coupon."}
{"text":"Burger 21 is so delicious! Their beef tastes WAY better than some of other burger places nearby. The patty is a lot thicker and has more flavor, a bit salty but oh so good. I was really happy that I could get extra ranch sides ...because at other places my ranch is always forgotten on to-go orders."}
{"text":"Ballantyne has no shortage of burger Joints, so I was a little shocked to see another one had opened, but I had to try it (because who doesn't loooove a good juicy burger?).  Immediately in looking at the menu I noticed right away that they were priced lower (for the most part) compared to its nearby competitors. I feel they have a variety of burgers to choose from so one can definitely find something. If you can't, there is no \"build your burger\" option but I am sure they can substitute if needed (most places can). I ordered the 'shroom and my husband ordered the black & bleu. I ordered mine medium because I noticed that medium here is closer to medium rare, and indeed it was, which is how I prefer it. The burgers aren't overly big 6.2 oz before cooking so I don't feel as guilty about eating it. We both enjoyed them. The sauce bar is also unique, but the marshmallow one  was very sweet and I am unsure why you would add that to a burger, but then again I am more of a traditionalist.  Overall it was good, we will be back."}
{"text":"Can I just say how much my family loves this place. Fresh burgers, any way that you want to dress them up. We were in there late last night and at some places that means you will get what's been sitting around under a warming lamp, we'll, not here.  We always order a large basket of half and half fries. My husband loves their shoestring potato fries and my daughter and I love the sweet potato ones and steal some of his as well. I think hat you always need to have a little of both in order to use all of their sauces that are delicious. The Thai ketchup is great with the fries and burgers, but I personally love the apple cider sauce and marshmallow sauce for fries.  The burgers are always very moist and I love to order their salads with a blackened burger to top it off. Don't forget to order one of their milkshakes. They're very rich and always have delicious flavors."}
{"text":"I, alongside my family, have been here numerous times, and the food is always fantastic. Great service, great food, and great aesthetics. I would recommend to anyone who wants a gourmet burger at an affordable price. The fries are spot on, and I have personally never tried desert, but I have heard it is also very good."}
{"text":"Burger 21 is the real deal. I had the Tex-Mex Haystack Burger Medium rare (cooked perfectly) with fries ($7.99). It was awesome. My son had a Kids Cheesy Burger with fries and a chocolate milk ($5.49). I was impressed that the chocolate milk was made to order. It wasn't the stuff in the little milk cartons. Nice job. The restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly. I know most everyone will compare it with Smashburger, Five Guys and Habit Burger. But here's some differences. First looking at Kids meals. My sons Cheeseburger, fries and made to order chocolate milk was $5.49. Smashburger it's $5.78 and that's with Horizon carton choc milk. Five Guys doesn't have a kid's burger so he gets the Little Cheeseburger ($5.09) which doesn't come with fries or chocolate milk. In fact, they don't have chocolate milk or really any drinks for kids other than the soda machine and tea. Regardless, adding $3.79 for fries (which of course is enough to share) and $2.39 for a regular drink and Five Guys becomes VERY expensive to take my son for lunch or dinner. In fact, just about everywhere is cheaper for a kids meal. And Habit Burger is the least expensive @ $4.50 for a kids cheeseburger, fries and choc milk. The burger I ordered, the Tex-Mex Haystack @ $7.99 would cost about $7.29 at Smashburger, $8.99 at Five Guys and about $8.35 at Habit although Habit includes fries and a drink. They each have their own positives but if you're near Burger 21 I would recommend stopping and checking them out."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good. My family and I loved our burgers and milkshakes. I never thought I would crave a turkey burger so much, but it is absolutely delicious. They have a bunch of different sauces and we tried them all.  Wonderful! The sweet potato fries are just as fabulous as the regular fries.  Be aware that they don't come with the burgers and must be ordered separately. This place is definitely going in the rotation and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have to give Burger 21 only two stars for a couple of reasons. First, service. Despite there being at least 15 staff members, service was slow. My friends order came out 11 minutes before mine did. The owner clearly saw that we had been waiting a while for the second burger, but he just asked a staff member to check on it rather than find out himself. It wasn't busy as we went around 1:30 pm. Second reason I am disappointed was I ordered my burger without cheese. When my order finally came out, it was clear they scraped off the cheese. I could still see melted cheese on it that had been wiped off. It could have been they reused the same bun and toppings and made a new burger patty, hence the long wait...but either way there was cheese on part of it, then wiped off. I did inform the owner who apologized and gave me a $5 off coupon for my next visit. For a burger that was $8 without fries, this was somewhat insulting especially after he informed me the cook made a new burger. Either I was lying or he was. They offered to make me a new one but I wasn't wanting to wait another 15 minutes. After all was said and done, I ate less than about half the burger as it was very soggy and I was ready to just leave. The $5 coupon isn't enough incentive to get me to try it again. That's a shame as I was hoping it would be a great neighborhood joint like Fired Pie next door is."}
{"text":"This place is great! Oreo shake is delicious.  The menu is creative and extensive and they have a separate menu dedicated to gluten free. There are high top tables, booths, and a soda fountain type bar you can sit at. Lots of French fry dipping sauces including Cajun, Thai ketchup, and honey mustard , etc and an option to order FF basket with half regular fries and half sweet potato. They have a soda machine that allows you to customize the kind of soda and flavor you get. I ordered the bacon cheesy and it was very good and the fries are thin cut and well salted. The prices are reasonable for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"When walked in we were greeted with a smile and bright interior decor. We ordered two chicken burgers with a side of sweet potatoe fries. They also have one of the updated soda machines.  While we waited there was a large selection of dipping sauces which impressed. Including some off the wall ones which went great with the fries.  Our food came out quickly and I reallllly enjoyed my experience here."}
{"text":"Best burger I ever had in my life so good & so are the shakes it's A1 I will definitely come back & tell my friends & bring them too"}
{"text":"A friend and I have been here a handful of times since it opened. The burgers are pretty good, and it's a quick place to grab a bite that's close to our work. We went in today after receiving an e-mail from their e-mail club. Long story short, there was a miscommunication on the e-mail, and it was not what it said it was. Regardless, the manager on duty, Charlie, was extremely rude, even when presented with the printed e-mail. That girl has some attitude!!  We did not receive a free burger as the e-mail indicated, nor were we offered an apology - just attitude. We paid for our burgers, ate them and on our way out, asked for the franchise manager's contact information (name, email, etc.).  We were not given any information, and as we were walking out, the lovely Ms. Charley said \"yeah, read your e-mail.\" Worst customer service I have ever experienced!  So disappointing!"}
{"text":"This place is like another version of Smashburger. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. Lol. However, the minute you walk in you feel like you're in a Smashburger.   I ordered the cinco burger. This was a very good size and comes with lettuce, tomato, guacamole, salsa, jalapeños, cheese, and cilantro cream. Everything was great except the jalapeños killed me!! We also got fries with our order. They were good. Nothing special.   I think they're just as good as Smashburger. I love that they have a dipping station though. Get as much sauce as you want everyone! Not to mention the customer service was great."}
{"text":"Great burgers and amazing variations on the traditional burger. Awesome sweet potato fries and French fries, I'd advise the half and half basket, and a slew of sauces to dip them in or pour onto anything you'd like, including your burger. The spicy Thai shrimp burger was amazing!! And you have more healthy side options for the kiddos too, such as grapes. If only I lived closer~!"}
{"text":"Someone told me about the place so I tried it out.  I order a shrimp burger with fries and it was really good to my surprise. You pick anywhere to sit and they also have outside seating. I would go back to try a real burger and se how it stacks up to the place I love that is not too far from here."}
{"text":"It was a disappointing dinner as I expected more.  You enter and everyone is very friendly and the decor is bright and clean.  I ordered a burger and a beer, my wife ordered the chicken tender basket  We were told to take a seat and they would bring our food out to us in ~8 minutes.  We stocked up on sauces and sat down, unfortunately I finished my beer in 15 minutes, but still didn't have our food.  So we people watched, and watched the people coming in after us get served when we did.  The burger was bland and boring, just skillet cooked and not very good beef.  The side order of sweet potato fries I got were shoestring thin and wonderful though.  My wife liked her chicken tenders, which might have been the reason for the delay, but the extremely large order of regular fries that came with her tenders were plain jane.  The Sauces bar was a disappointment - the marshmallow dip was gross but worth a try, but didn't really go with anything.  The tai ketchup was the best, but was not spicy enough.  The BBQ sauce tasted like cheap kraft BBQ sauce.  Just a letdown really, I am not a big fan of five guys, but I would have rather brought a five guys burger and eaten it there."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place as I have driven by it tons of times. Tried ordering the food online as they have that option on their website. Unfortunately it failed twice and when I called it in they said it hasn't been working since they opened. We had the cinco burger and the Texas haystack. The burgers were great and cooked the way we wanted them. The veggies on the burger were fresh and spicy. We also got the ale fries which were so so. The place is still pretty new but very clean."}
{"text":"Great burgers seasoned perf! Came twice around lunch time and the staff and timing of getting food is good! Fries and hot and delicious as the burger! Wide variety of condiment selection! Must try and hopefully more will open around the charlotte area"}
{"text":"Falling somewhere between \"fast food\" and \"fast casual\" is Burger 21. A large menu of different burgers and a variety of toppings, plus fries, plus shakes. I met some friends here for lunch and we had a pleasant experience. There is seating inside and outside on their canvased patio.  I opted for the \"Gruyere burger\" and asked for it at medium. It didn't take nearly as long as the ten minutes I was promised, which left enough time to get a couple of different dipping sauces (thai ketchup! honey mustard!) and my drink from the fountain of coke products.  Burger was excellent. Very messy due to the fried egg on top that burst on the first bite. Grilled onions, tomato, bacon, and thin asparagus on a brioche bun. Tasty stuff, here.  Not just beef, but also veggies and chickens and turkeys and even shrimp and ahi tuna!"}
{"text":"I met some friends at Burger 21 for lunch. All the staff was very friendly, they made a point to make it feel like a normal sit-down restaurant despite the fact that you order your food at a counter. They bring you and pick up your food when you're done. They have a large menu, including several burgers, chicken sandwiches, turkey and veggie burgers, sweet potato, regular, and cheese fries. For a healthier option, they have a few salads. However, it gets a little pricey when ordering because fries are not included in a combo price. They also have many delicious milkshakes that add to your overall bill. A sauce bar adds some uniqueness to burger 21- they have around 10 different sauces you can dip your fries in or add to your burger. Overall, I enjoyed Burger 21, but I wouldn't be able to eat there very often considering it is pretty unhealthy. I mean, how can you go to a burger place and not indulge in a burger, fries, AND a shake?"}
{"text":"I love the openess of this restaurant. Theres a great patio area covered and open. The burgers a huge and delish!!!!!  And they dont skimp on the kids plate either. Dont miss out on the shakesband sundaes! So.make sure to leave room for dessert."}
{"text":"Wide range of burgers... You'll eventually find something you like. But make sure your wallet is heavy when you go in."}
{"text":"Good burgers and shakes but way way way over priced. Fries were nothing special. Rather go to sit down restaurant like Red Robin."}
{"text":"What is all the hype about at this place?! Nothing! I thought this was some sort of fancy burger place, but as soon as you walk in, it's your average fast food burger joint. Place is misleading in my opinion. The fries were soggy and worse then regular fast food places, burgers were not cooked deliciously and dry. Milk shakes are not made with real ice cream and the chocolate one is over loaded with Hershey's syrup. Blah!   The major disappointed was not only the food, but they cannot handle a rush of customers. We walked in when it was moderately busy. No line. The kid at the counter who took our order was super slow and no help at all. No suggestions, no up sales, just super lazy with his customer service skills. We sat down and waited about 20-30 minutes to get our food while hearing people yell at each other in the kitchen, constantly calling out a servers name over and over again. Very annoying and unprofessionally loud. Not good. No love. Don't go here. Wait at least 6 months until they get there staff straightened out.  On another note! The concept of this place is great! It's a nice clean place. Love the ideas of a lot of different burgers and specials. I like the menu.   But you need good cooks, loyal employees. Good service to execute. They are not at all there yet. I'll go back on the next blue moon and review again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars   We came here the other night for dinner, I ordered the black bean burger while my boyfriend ordered the Tex-Mex burger with chicken. We also got some fries to share. It seems like they have a good selection of burgers and change them how you like. I LOVE the in house sauces, the Ragin Cajun sauce... I could put it on everything! I also really like the Thai Ketchup.    I sadly found my burger disappointing, it seemed frozen compared to all the in house black bean patties I have had. That's not cool when they are serving all natural and organic etc. meat patties. Its not too hard to make black bean patties, very easy and super cheap. My boyfriend's burger was a lot better than mine, I guess I have to get the chicken here from now on. The fries were tasty but a little pricey for $3 for a small.   I'll be back to try out the chicken burgers and stock up on that Ragin' Cajun."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of veggie burgers. It's a thing. I love burger joints, especially the recent trend of quick casual spots popping up left and right. For me, it's always a challenge to find a veggie burger that is more than a Morningstar Farms patty that's overcooked.  Search no further. Burger 21's Black Bean Burger is a game changer. I ordered mine sans red onion and substituted their utterly perfect brioche for the whole wheat bun that comes standard.   I devoured every morsel happily. So, so good. I'll easily recommend this place to meat and veggie lovers alike.  They also have banging fries, of  both the regular and sweet potato variety. And a plethora of dipping sauces ranging from toasted marshmallow (you either love it or hate it) to thai ketchup.  The burgers are thick and juicy, and there is no end to the number of combinations you can try. The Mr recently ordered the tuna burger, while friends went with The Skinny (turkey burger).   I think this chain is doing things right, and I have no doubt that Burger21 will be successful in this new Ballantyne location."}
{"text":"I got the thursday special 2 sliders n sweet potato fries. Perfect size for a mini person :). My bf had the tex mex. They were very good in my opinion, especially the fries. Self served sauce area. A little pricey but a lot better than most places."}
{"text":"\"Red meat is not bad for you. Now, blue-green meat--that's bad for you!\" ? Tom Smothers  Two days of Thanksgiving leftovers is about all I can take before I want something different.  Those who know me know I love my seafood.  While The Ahi Tuna Burger would usually be right up my alley, I decided that after so much turkey in my belly, I wanted a greasy cheesy burger and thus, I ordered the Cheesy Burger from Burger 21!    I've been wanting to give this place a try.  With a location in Scottsdale, I never had an opportunity to stop by since I'm rarely in the area.  When I saw they were setting up right next to a delicious pizza place a couple doors down, I waited patiently to get my hands on a burger.  Today was the day I got to sink my teeth into one of these bad boys!  The Cheesy Burger is described as, \"Lettuce, tomato, American, cheddar, or Swiss [what I ended up choosing] cheese, toasted brioche bun.\"  It was all that and more.  Juicy flavorful meat for $6.50!  I got a side of sweet potato fries with my burger since I wanted to take advantage of their condiments station.  The mister got the Tex-Mex Haystack with sweet potato fries and a bananas foster milkshake.  Everything was so tasty!  Even that grease that oozes out of the burger with every bite was good.  Burger 21 does their burgers justice.  It's either that or my taste-buds were just happy from protein that didn't come in gobble-til-ya-wobble form.  Nonetheless, I like how they make their milkshakes.  Yummy!  Would I come here again?  Definitely.  I need to try that Ahi Tuna Burger, Spicy Thai Shrimp Burger, and some cheese & ale fries!  Note:  Sweet potato fries and toasted marshmallow sauce is a definite winner.  The chipotle mayo sauce is also friggin amazing.  Woo!"}
{"text":"Our first time at Burger21 I was expecting a much more flavorful burger. I got the cheesy bacon burger cooked medium It was way to raw for my liking it was more like medium rare. Also it was not very \"cheesy\" it had a thin slice of American on it and the bun was cold. We also ordered the cheese fries with bacon and chives. It was like white water with soggy bacon floating in it. Next time I'll just go to 5guys"}
{"text":"Great burgers and dogs, fried chicken and onion rings. Great prices. Wish they stayed open till 9:30 every night!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken marsala burger and I do not recommend it, it was soggy and had a weird texture. My boyfriend ordered the black and blue burger, it was just average. The fries were delicious and they have good dipping sauces. The staff was very friendly and the service was quick but the food was just OK."}
{"text":"Just came in for shakes and they were great!  The food looked good so we will definitely go back and try the food."}
{"text":"Epic Fail in Service. Good burger, so not worth the wait. Wimpy fries but the cheese ale sauce is good. Don't waste your time. Find a Smashburger instead.  When you have an hour for lunch and you can't eat? That's a big fail. I think the 21 stands for 21 hour wait."}
{"text":"Finally tried the place. Weird system of how you order for sure , walk up to register, grab a menu then step back to read it while others are doing the same thing . Ordered the special and by chance they were out of it. Got a regular burger and fries. Burger was cooked too well , nothing special at all. Fries were solid though. It's fits right in between burgatory and 5 guys burgers in the price range.  Not too cheap and not too pricey. Wouldn't go.out my way to stop but if needed I could eat it again."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the recent reviews of this place. I've been here several times and I've always had a good experience. The burgers are good and have fun and different options. The cinco, black and blue and original burger are all delish. I've been for lunch and dinner and I've never seen it dirty. Their milkshakes are awesome, they will even split a milkshake for you if you're sharing. One of the better burger chains in my opinion and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try out Burger 21 for years. Finally I made it in when I signed up for their rewards club and received a coupon for free fries. I placed my order online. I loved that their online system allowed you to select how much of an item you wanted with each item. For example you can select EXTRA lettuce & LITE cheese. I also enjoyed that you could choose to pay cash in the restaurant and not online, which allowed me to use my coupon. I placed my order and it told me about how long it'd take to fulfill which was 15 minutes. I arrived and went to the area with the big sign for Take Out Orders. I presented my coupon and they applied the discount. Pretty quick and seamless process. But once I paid, they handed me my receipt with no direction. So I just kind of stood there wondering where my food was. I didn't see a kitchen so I was confused. I walked around the corner to see if I was supposed to go to another counter but there were just restrooms there. So I found a tablet and sat down until about 5 minutes later my order came out.   The burger was seasoned nicely. It had a lot of flavor so I enjoyed it for the most part. But the extra lettuce that I asked for must've disappeared or melted away. I'd consider what i received a typical amount, not extra. And it was soggy under the burger. Then the cheese wasn't that great either. I enjoyed the sweet potato fries with the Apple Cider sauce. I was excited that they had sauce options for them unlike other places that only serve typical condiments with them. I thought the Marshmallow sauce was too sweet but I could see how it would be a good option for others. For the most part I enjoyed my meal, though it's not a place i'd \"crave\". It didn't leave a lasting impression.  After I wrote this review, I received a call from the Manager, explaining the ordering process and apologizing for my experience. I really appreciated this and it showed that they really value their customers opinions and take it serious. She stated she'd be making sure everyone explains the wait for fresh cooked fries to customers. So I bumped this review from 3 stars to 4. I'll be giving them another try!"}
{"text":"A bit pricy, but truly a fantastic burger spot for a casual counter service place. I got the Texas burger which comes with a multitude of premium toppings like avocado, deep fried onion strings and gouda cheese.  I knew I was about to become a fan when the guy said I could have it cooked rare if I wanted. I opted for med rare and it came out perfectly cooked. We got a pound of sweet potato fries to share.  A perfect accompaniment to the fries was a huge sauce counter with a dozen or so choices including some bizarre ones like toasted marshmallow and apple cider. I enjoyed the Chipotle mayo, Thai ketchup, and ragin' cajun. The apple was surprisingly good as well. Fries themselves were thinner than I prefer but decent enough. As for the burger,  outstanding! Easily the best I've had from a casual joint and rivaled the best from a high end restaurant. It's worth the 8 dollar price tag, but when you add $3 for 1 order of sweet potato fries and $2.19 for a drink, you're talking $14 per person with tax.  Another downside  is they don't have any grilled chicken sandwiches on the menu, which is basically all my mom orders at these places. They also have veggie, ground chicken and turkey patties if red meat isn't your thing. I tried a bite of my brother's chicken parm burger which was quite yummy.  But ground beef is the way to go if you ask me.  Other than the price and somewhat limited options,  I can't really complain about anything. Will definitely make it back when I return to Charlotte."}
{"text":"The vision of this burger joint came from the owners of The Melting Pot. The idea was to have an upscale burgers in a hip environment. And guess what! They donate 10% of the day's proceeds to a local charity or school on the 21st of each month!   Located apart of a shopping center and right next to Moe's. Today was a perfect day to sit outside and they had outdoor seating. Not so great when it is super windy though, because the wind will lift your skirts, snatch your babies, and more importantly steal your napkins.   The environment was nice, clean, and they had free wifi. Staff was very friendly as well.   The featured special is a #21 Korean BBQ burger that has bulgogi, kimchi, fresh herbs, salad, Korean Ninja sauce (gochujang), and its packed with a bit of fiyyyaahhh. Their menu consists of 11 beef burgers, 4 chicken burgers, 2 turkey burgers, 2 seafood burgers, and 2 veggie burgers. They also have chicken tenders for your picky children or grilled cheese, gourmet hotdogs, and sliders for the indecisive peeps. French Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, beef Chillis, salads, shakes, and cookies and sundaes.   The sauce bar includes 8-10 different sauces like Thai ketchup, Ranch, ketchup, BBQ, Raging Cajun... They have a few toppings as add-ons like Chilli, fried egg, avocado... I wish they had bacon jam. yummm bacon jam.. fruity fatness in a jam.   I ordered the chicken parm sandwich. It was not as messy as most burgers and tasted better than expected. The cheese was perfectly gooey and you could taste the fresh tomatoes in the sauce. I would recommend this burger and can't wait to be back to try the others.   The Fries were delicious. I asked for extra crispy and they came out perfectly golden with a great crunch! They were long and perfect for trying out the different sauces. If you wanted to get real naaaaasty, you can mix them and try them all together."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times and the food was good but on the pricey side. The last time I went I sat 30 min to wait for my order. I asked several times but poor response. I had to get up and leave and asked for a refund which the manager did give me. If you are the owner your store is not setup properly to handle the lunch crowds. You are loosing money and customers due to this. I want to see small business do well so you need to get this fixed quick.   Good luck"}
{"text":"Another burger place,  this one is pretty good located at Indian Bend and Scottsdale Road just East of Scottsdale Road.  Shared the Bayou Burger, Shroom Burger, Chicken Marcela Burger and Basket of Fries and the Salted Carmel Pretzel Shake. The Bayou Burger was good and I elected to have the Sriracha on the side. I would next time rather order a burger rather than the turkey sausage burger (Bayou Burger). The shroom burger was good and the fries came in a good size basket. The Salted Carmel Pretzel Shake was awesome and my daughter devoured it.  The most interesting thing was the dozen or so sauces available for burgers or fries.The Chipotle Mayo was probably the best. The Toasted Marshmallow was interesting but just okay.  Reminds me of a little nicer Smash Burger with a little bit nicer interior.   My recommendation is get a burger and not chicken or turkey parties."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the decor, I like the clean, simple look. Ordered two cheesy burgers, a creme brûlée milkshake and orange float with a side of large fries.  At the sauce bar there was a multitude of options but my daughter and I were most interested in the toasted marshmallow.  She enjoyed her creme brûlée shake, saying the flavor was spot on and it was very sweet. Our burgers were brought out and they were cooked exactly how we wanted. I definitely liked the brioche bun. We both devoured our burger! I was at Smashburger a few weeks before and I will say I prefer this burger over theirs.  I wasn't so impressed with the fries, but whether it was habit or hunger or the fact that I hate to see fries wasted, we both ate every last one so how bad could they be? Lol!  The have burger deals through the week, if I come back it will be on one of those days."}
