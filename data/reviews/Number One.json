{"text":"We dont usually order canadianized chinese food but we were hungry and decided to try something new and were we every sorry we did. We ordered dinner for 2: - egg rolls which tasted like it was couple of days old dont ask me what was in it - chicken chop suey which was ok - chicken fried rice, worst of the bunch, it was wet and soggy, how can u go wrong with chicken fried rice! - lemon chicken which barely got a pass  If I were you I would pass on this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience there. I went for lunch with a friend and I ordered the rice with the chicken balls and an iced tea. At the end of the meal, I found a hairball or something of the sort in my iced tea!! It was horrendous!"}
{"text":"My roomie and I had a hankering for chicken balls the other night, so we decided to order from the closest Chinese restaurant to our apartment that also had their menu online. Number One Chinese Restaurant (a bit of a cocky name, but, we'll let it slide) fit that bill, and fortunately they satisfied our hankering quite well.  Alongside our order of chicken balls (1 order = 12 chicken balls, woo!), we also ordered sweet 'n' sour wontons, sliced beef with green peppers and onions, steamed rice, an egg roll for the roomie and a spring roll for me, all of which totaled up to about $22 after the 10% pick-up discount and tax. A good price, and overall the food was very yummy and plentiful with lots of delicious leftovers for the days to come. The chicken balls were great and served with their traditionally awesome red sauce; the wontons were crispy, totally unhealthy and amazing; the beef dish was super flavourful and even better than expected because carrots and red peppers were thrown into the mix as well; and the rice was, well, generic white rice. Unfortunately neither of us were pleased with our appetizer choices - I even threw out the second half of my spring roll which was filled with some pretty disgusting ground chicken. Next time I'll just skip to the main course.  As per any good Chinese take-out meal, we finished off with a fortune cookie each, both of which, I'd like to note, had totally bizarre fortunes. The roomie's: \"If you've got it, flaunt it.\" Mine: \"Don't let friends impose on you.\" Huh? Thanks for those pearls of non-wisdom, Wing's Fortune Cookies."}
{"text":"Great decor and great good at a great price. This place is great! If you are in the area and looking for something quick and good come here.  The staff is friendly and welcoming which is different from a lot of similar places in the city."}
{"text":"I don't understand the terrible reviews from this place. Maybe something has changed in the last few months, but I ordered some take-out last night and felt compelled to stand up for this place. It is everything that I want from a Chinese take-out joint. The crispy ginger beef is amazing (definitely try it). The chicken fried rice was great too, and not soggy like others suggested. It had an awesome charred flavor, I couldn't get enough. We also got the chicken & veg in black bean sauce, which was awesome, super tender chicken and crisp peppers & onions. Probably the best spring rolls I've ever had- stuffed with ground pork and bean sprouts for around a buck each.   I'd definitely suggest giving this place a try. It'll be my new go-to chinese takeout spot for sure."}
{"text":"This place was under construction for a long time , but with new renovations this place looks great. There are only a few new changes to the menu, but most of the stuff is just the same. I don't try very many things, but usually just the staples. Cantonese chow mein, General Toso, and like chicken balls. They can be busy during the weekends so the wait is sometimes long, but within he east york area, this place is definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"I really like this place for Chinese food in the danforth area. Their breaded deep fried chicken balls are mostly chicken! It's great! They do everything well. Of all the takeout Chinese restaurants I've tried in the area, this place is awesome. I did find their chicken wings to be mediocre. And the spicy salt and pepper shrimp tends to be over-fried. But otherwise, every other item they do well."}
{"text":"This was one of my favourite restaurants for Chinese take-away.  What happened? New ownership? New cooks?  The food was delivered late and barely warm. Every dish we ordered was tasteless. There was NO heat in the schezuan dishes or the curry. I ordered spring rolls got egg rolls  I called them...response was ... ah that's too bad, I'll tell them  Using this place for years never again"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and always giving chance to our 'hood restaurants, so on one afternoon we decided to check Number One Chinese Restaurant out. We soon realized that the name is far from the reality.  The place looks nice and renovated, so does the  menu. At that time when we were eating in there were no vegetarian options. Seems they have it on the menu now, as just checked from their webpage.   Since not much for eat, as we were looking for a light lunch, we ordered two soups, Egg Drop Soup and Hot & Sour Soup [spicy] soups. Weren't very impressed by the service, as the person wasn't flexible putting a nice meal together for vegetarians.  Ate the soup and left with sour taste in mouth. Not a place for vegetarians."}
{"text":"It remains as my go-to takeout Chinese place at the moment - mostly due to so many positive comments. I am always concerned when food is delivered extremely quickly, 15min, tells me it's not as freshly made as I would like."}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad ratings.  I generally always order the same thing. General Tso chicken and fried rice, with a wonton soup. It's huge portions, everything is cooked great. I also always order delivery and it always comes very quick, generally within 20 minutes. I think the price is good for what it is.  My boyfriend always gets the chicken balls or lemon chicken also with fried rice and he always enjoys himself. I've never felt sick or anything after eating here the million times that I have. I've only ever been stuffed.  Given, my review is always for delivery, I have never sat in and ate a meal in their restaurant. But i've never had a problem with this restaurant. I think it is the best and quickest chinese food in East York."}
{"text":"Oh my dear lord. It is rare that I throw away leftovers without any hint of regret or sense of waste, but that's exactly what I did with my leftover General Tso chicken and beef and broccoli from Number One Chinese Restaurant. I hate to be harsh, but the whole heap of it was terrible.  Last night my roommate and I had a hankering for cheap'n'greasy Chinese food--not the authentic stuff, but the highly Canadianized, deep-fried-everything version. What we got instead was a disgrace to any continent's cuisine. It always boggles my mind when a restaurant can't make the very dishes it specializes in. Have they spent years and years perfecting mediocrity?  We ordered two of the most common dishes in the Chinese food canon--beef and broccoli and General Tso chicken. I was so excited to indulge in these high-salt/fat delights. What we got was definitely high in salt, but low in flavour. Does anyone remember the General Tso chicken from Peter Street Deli? It was SO GOOD. My hopes were obviously set too high. This place should definitely consider a name change.  This leaves me to wonder where I should order Chinese food in Leslieville? After ten years of residency, I still don't know!"}
{"text":"For the usual Canadian Chinese food, this place is great. Affordable, good portion sizes, and the staff are generally very nice."}
{"text":"Admittedly I am a Chinese food snob, but when it comes down to it I can eat anything. Want to know why I have a problem with this place?  1) Can't get my order right. I ordered spare ribs NOT chicken balls. Not to mention that the chicken balls are more balls then chicken and are NOT authentic Chinese food.  2) MSG induced headache after meal - my head is stinging just thinking about it.  3) Pretentious name for a place that is just not up to standard.  For the love of god just go to East Chinatown and skip this place."}
{"text":"I have picked up orders and/or had delivery on several occasions. The food has always been hot (like, scald your fingers on the foil trays hot), fresh, generously portioned, and well prepared. Delivery has always been timely.  The restaurant itself looks to seat about 30 people or so. It is spotlessly clean and very recently decorated in a modern style (no dusty Chinese lanterns here!). They are licensed, and the beer is a decent price ($4 a bottle... sometimes we walk in to order and have one beer while we wait).   One thing to be aware of, if you are picking up your order, is that cash is king! There is a 10% discount for customers who pay cash on a pickup order. If you pay debit, there is a tip option on the debit machine with no apparent way to bypass it (I wasn't about to ask, \"Hey, I can't figure out how to bypass this tip thing\")  (Note that I tip for dining in, and delivery, but I don't feel its necessary when I'm picking up an order).  I ended up giving them 10% just to get past the screen.  My order came to $51.60.  If I had cash, I'd have paid $46.44 (10% discount). As it was, I paid $56.76 (full price plus unavoidable tip). That's a steep difference (20%!!)."}
