{"text":"Their chips and salsa are off the hook! They are made fresh throughout the day the chips come to your table so hot so be very careful! My favorite dish to order is the carne asada fries! They are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst food I have had short of an airplane meal. Greasy flavorless Mexican food. I ordered a carne asada taco  half of it was gristle and the other half was fat  nasty  I will drive to la paloma in Litchcield Park instead  where food is good  place is clean"}
{"text":"Have you checked their health inspections? I did after eating there and will never eat there again. The food was nasty! So is the cleanliness...nasty!  Buckeye needs a good Mexican Rest. but this is not it."}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  Don't eat here unless you are trying to lose weight.  I lost my dinner before I made it to the truck.  We asked the waitress for white meat chicken and we were brought a leg quarter that had been microwaved.  Idk why this place is called a steakhouse.  It is a Mexican food joint with a menu for american food on the side.  The sign outside even states \"and Mexican food\"."}
{"text":"Love this place!   The ladies are always sweet. Food is fresh and hot!  Love the food portion the fountain drinks are high priced   Place is pretty clean"}
{"text":"It's really hit or miss here. I was in last week around 9pm and it was good. I went in today and the meat was bland, so much so that I didn't even finish my food. When my husband mentioned it he was told that the same guy is making all the food. I'm not really sure how that's possible considering they are open 24/7. No offer for a discount or replacement of food. Service is also lacking, dirty tables and no service after you receive food."}
{"text":"Definitely not stingy with the chicken in tacos, rice and beans are fair,but not bad.  Service pleasant. Quirky looking place, buts it's cute...picnic tables"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Buckeye to eat.. The food is mixture of western (steak & ribs), Mexican and even some Greek items. My favorite foods are the Gyro's & Carne Asada burritos. The prices are very fair. If you like food that is moderately price with a wide variety  that taste good and if you do not care about privacy then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I got a combo  Hands the worst most disgusting burrito I ate literally was onion and water so gross never again"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place that served Gyro's and this place serves them. I ordered mine to go so I cannot comment on the wait service but the taste of the gyro meat was pretty good. I was a little put off by the overall condition and cleanliness of the place, I did not see any bugs but would not have been surprised if one came strutting out of the back at any moment. It just didn't look clean and although I did like the Gyro, I have decided not to return because I have a feeling it is not very clean and that means the food is probably in nasty conditions in the back, I would suggest they clean and make the place look better with some nicer furnishing and maybe some paint and bleach. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"I've had pleasant experiences eating here.  The food is pretty good and greasy.  The price...can't beat it.  My only concern is cleanliness.  The last time I ate there the bathroom had crickets dead and alive all over the ground.  Not appetizing!  I've also heard from certain folks (more than 3) that they have found bugs in their food.  Well, it's under new management now and the place has really shaped up!  Give it a chance!"}
{"text":"First of all, that name is completely misleading. There is nothing either Western, cowboy, or steakhouse-y about this place ~ it's a divey Mexican joint, along the lines of the Campos chain or your local carniceria. That said, once the disappointment wore off, I found the waitress perfectly sweet & accommodating, the Tamarindo nice & tart, & the chips hot & plentiful. The rice & beans were quite standard ~ neither gross, nor amazing. It was the scrambled eggs, which  smelled & tasted way off, that're responsible for the two-star rating ~ I was afraid to even put them in my mouth!! Nevertheless, there is beer here, & the hours are 24/7, so another visit is all but inevitable, with the implicit caveat of staying away from all breakfast things on the menu. Hashtag RipeForATakeover."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for lunch a few days ago. The layout is a western cowboy canteen styled theme. The waitress who served us was exceptionally polite and an overall delight. The chips and salsa were some of the best we've had in quite awhile. It was a little off putting that the drinks came in styrofoam cups, probably made it easier for the to-go's I suppose. We both ordered the gyro with fries and a burrito. The gyro wasn't exactly worth $9. I've had gyros from all over the valley now and this one, is not exactly up to snuff for them to be charging that amount. And they need to go back to the drawing board on their tzatziki sauce. But the burritos were fairly priced, and I'd recommend you have them deep fried. It gives them a bit of an added crunch that makes them just oh so much better, and technically that turns them into chimichangas.. In the end, I'll be going back, just have to stick to what they know. And as far as I know, cowboys in the wild west did not make gyros."}
{"text":"Usually really good but today food was horrible.  I order carne asada nachos,  chips were full of oil, beans and carne asada tasted dry/old, hardly had a guacamole and sour cream and cheese didn't melt. Salsa was watered down had no flavor very disappointing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there yesterday and we will never go there again.. We only got our drinks with chips and salsa and never were asked what we wanted to order.. The waitress waited on everyone else and took there orders and not ours.. That is bullshit.. I recommend that no one goes there.. The service was poor.. Plus the air conditioner wasn't working and it was very hot in there"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service at the front desk and have \"OKAY\" food. Definitely recommend Fiesta's instead."}
{"text":"Try the Chorizo Burrito....Great! So are the Carne asada tacos....and grab a brew. Definitely a come back place."}
{"text":"Sent my boyfriend down to order what I usually get elsewhere. I asked for 1 taco, an enchilada, rice, beans and chips. It was horrible and I only ate the chips. I just now looked at the receipt and I was charged individually for everything totaling over $17. That's the last time I go there. I usually get a Breakfast burrito and it's around $4 and have been eating there for almost 3 years.  Way to Go! You just lost a regular!"}
{"text":"Nice place to stop when traveling. Decor is basic but the service is very good, as is the food. I have to eat gluten free and they willingly swapped a baked potato for French fries and both the ribs and chicken were gluten free."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is very affordable and great food. We've lived in Buckeye for 7 years and go there 2-3 times a month. A must if you are visiting Buckeye."}
{"text":"So their Mexican food is not the greatest and I insist on ordering for reasons I don't understand besides me craving Mexican. However, my bf gets the gyro meat sandwich meal and I always get in on that action and it's always great! So I definitely recommend the gyro. I've never actually had a steak here so maybe that's where I should be at since it is a \"steakhouse\"... they always bring complimentary chips and salsa. the chips are ok the salsa not so much. It reminds me of enchilada sauce more than salsa. Their guac is way more liquidy which is a little disturbing. I wish I could rank them higher because their staff has always been friendly but alas my lack luster feels for the foods overpowers the review."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this place is under new ownership, but the food has changed greatly. Since the environment has always been a little \"shabby\" this coupled with the food no longer being tasty, meant I needed to edit/update my review."}
{"text":"I usually only come here for the Chicken Greek Salad, which is hit or miss if its really good or not. I love the chips n salsa. The other night my mom and I went there,decided to get the Mexican food.. HUGE mistake!  I should have known better because I didn't like it before... I like to give 2nd chances.  The beans are disgusting! Rice was cold, taco, not so good.. Very disappointed... I will stick to La Placita in Buckeye when it comes to Mexican food.  They really need tp paint the walls, it's horrible and looks unclean."}
{"text":"My other half and I LOVE this place and go out of our way to stop.   Food: We both think the burritos are SCRUMPTIOUS... we usually do shredded beef and bean or Machaca.  I absolutely love the Gyros... it's not that pressed gyro meat I find all over Phoenix!  He, on the other hand, loves the Menudo. I can't comment on that myself because I can't stand the stuff... wishing they had Pozole. :) We've had the hamburgers and felt those were kinda so-so.   Drinks: The Tamarindo is just right on the tart-sweet thing and the Horchata kicks butt!!!  Staff & Restaurant in general: All of the gals, and even the cooks in back, have been super friendly and helpful. We also call in our orders a lot because we drive. Our orders have never been wrong and the food has been just as good to go as it has when we have time to sit down.  I wouldn't call it a steak house, but with the level of goodness on the Greek food side, I wouldn't necessarily call it just a Mexican restaurant either. :)  Could it use a name change? Probably. Is it a hole in the wall restaurant? Compared to what I'd expect from a \"Steak House\", yes. But we like it regardless and will definitely continue to eat there!!  Of course I've also learned while dating a Mexican that some of the \"hole in the wall\" restaurants are better than MANY of the ones I grew up being told were \"good\" places to go.... I'm all about the flavor!!"}
{"text":"I moved to Buckeye three years ago. Tried this place when I first moved here. Have not been back. Draw your own conclusions."}
{"text":"Was a buckeye resident for a year. A really great midnight meal place. A little sketchy looking but never has issues with the food nor service. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Great place to take the family and grab a bite to eat. Always a good time and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The food was just nasty. Let's just say my stomach didn't agree either. I had carne Asada fries. Never went back."}
{"text":"I went here while visiting my dad, he really likes this place but then he hardly gets real homemade food at home. Place is in old town Buckeye, I think it's the entrance. The food was ok, ribs were really dry needed way more BBQ sauce, and hardly any meat. I had 2 plates, my torta was good, the burger was just average cheese was not the best and fries were so-so. I dint pay so I dint mind."}
{"text":"Off the hook.  Best menudo I've had for $4.  4 BUCKS!!!  Breakfast for $4.  Plenty of food and very cheap."}
{"text":"I would not recommend coming here! We ordered our food took out first bites and got out of there real quick it was horrible! My son threw up from eating their beans and rice. Really who messes that up. It all tastes bland and just not good at all.."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Sonoran style Mexican food at cheap prices, and carne adovado chimichanga."}
