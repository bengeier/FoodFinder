{"text":"Used to be great. Not sure what happened but I ordered Hunan dumplings and General Tao. First: my food took well over an hour to arrive. The delivery driver shoved it in my face. Then, no chopsticks. What type of Chinese delivery doesn't give chopsticks? But the kicker? ALL my food was SOAKED. The dumplings were sitting in about an inch of water and the chicken tasted like, you got it. Water. Save your money, get your food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food, great flavours, plenty of variety too! Everyone from the waitress to the chef was very nice, and very knowledgeable too. They treated my fish allergy with care which was well appreciated. 
I believe they are under new management now, and should continue in this direction because it really is a fabulous off-island eat."}
{"text":"Without meaning to sound harsh, yet wanting to sound honest. This is by far the worse Chinese food I've tasted in Montreal. I've had my fair share of Chinese dishes in China Town, Montreal and even a hole in the wall is better than Imperial Palace. 
I went at 7:00pm on a Tuesday, only one table was there. Which left soon after we arrived. I was hoping more people would come, yet by 9:00pm, we were still the only ones here.
The owner/waiter greeted us politely, but with horrible jokes. 
Having been in Asia for a month, not a single of their dishes were typically Chinese. They were cheaply, tasteless, poorly prepared dishes. Without ordering the most expensive dishes, our total cost for three dishes two drinks, was $70.00. Without any wine.  When in all honesty I've had far better Dim Sum for three people at the cost of $30.00
Our General Tao chicken, was soggy, dripping in grease and sauce. The chicken pieces were tiny!
The fried rice with vegetables, was crunchy. Yes, including the rice. An absolute disappointment. 
In the middle of Winter, the parking lot was a complete ice skating rink!! Not a drop of salt was used. 
This is simply my opinion, yet my suggestion would be, don't eat here. Save yourself money and have better food at China Town."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! I've been 4 times and I've never been dissapointed. Full and happy! The staff is super friendly. I even ordered online once and the food arrived in under 15 mins. :)"}
{"text":"Maybe I was just really unlucky .. found a hair inside the general tao chicken. Not sure if it was all chicken either. Never going back ."}
{"text":"Best general tao chicken in the West Island!!!
Shrimp toasts are a must!
Will fulfill your cravings for Asian cuisine"}
