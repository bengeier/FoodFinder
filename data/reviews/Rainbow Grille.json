{"text":"Hands down best burger in Charlotte. The place doesn't look like much on the outside, but you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't get it confused with Rainbow Cafe, because the cafe is delicious and this place needs to be shut down.  The lady that was behind the counter sported a blue weave and a horrible attitude.  I came to this gorgeous, ghetto, hole in the wall (literally) against my better judgment to appease my rumbling tummy.  The place is dirty, and the food is too expensive for what it is.  No one is ever here, so I don't understand how they are even still open for business.  Check it out though; it sits beside an old abandoned strip club, pretty fitting."}
{"text":"The building is not the nicest place in town and the area either. But if you like a hole in the wall with a great great burer, then you need to make the trip. Sometimes the people working arent the nicest but the burgers are big and good."}
