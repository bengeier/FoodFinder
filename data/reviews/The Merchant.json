{"text":"Poor service. Food wasn't good. I had the meatloaf because that was most appealing item on the menu. Enough said.....sorry! Truth!"}
{"text":"We started the night with a friendly greeting at the door. Unfortunately, the night was a bust from there. Terrible service from our waitress - abrupt, impatient and unfriendly. She continually walked away as we were mid-sentence and left our empty glasses on the table without clearing them. The dark and stormys and pineapple cocktails that we ordered were subpar. The former were watered down and flavourless and the latter were tiny and not worth the price. Although my friends enjoyed their fish sandwiches, my poutine was inedible. The fries were soggy, swimming in gravy that looked and tasted like glue. The cheese appeared to not be cheese curds, but cubes of mozzarella that were ice cold in the middle. For a new restaurant, this place should be trying a lot harder than it is, especially with all of the competition in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered the fisherman's bowl and got a bowl with mussels only. Asked our server and another server and waited about 10 minutes before our server told us that the kitchen is making a new bowl. In between that, I asked to speak with the manager but he didn't bother. My wife's veggie burger slopped out of her hands when she bit into it. When I pointed it out to our server, he said that was \"normal.\" That dish was returned. Finally, the manager serves me a complimentary fisherman's bowl, claiming that the kitchen staff heard a different order (there are no mussels only dish on the menu.) Two pinkie sized pieces of salmon, three shrimp, two calamari rings and a few mussels is a fisherman's bowl here. It's good for the after work drink and patio, but their lack of communication and sub-par food warrants one star."}
{"text":"Formerly Fionn MacCool, this location has been stripped down and renovated to more upscale pub and another prime lunch/after work beer spot.  It's more modern, touched by the open space concept. 

The food has improved too.  Rest assured, the traditional pub standbys are still here, like burgers, fish & chips, chicken pot pie, and crispy chicken wings, but there are more English-style pub foods available as well (ie: curry).  Prices of mains are roughly $16-21, with the prime rib at the top end at $29 for half a pound.  For alcohol-free \"beer\" options, you can also get ginger beer or root beer on tap for $4.

For today's lunch, I had the Fisherman's Bowl ($19), featuring an assortment of seafood in a Clamato sauce with crusty, toasted bread on the side for sopping up any extra sauce.  Simple, but tasty. 
I stole a bite of my friends' cheese fondue ($11), which was cheesy but not, as my friend Chester says, \"DANGEROUSLY cheesy.\" 

Friendly service who are happy to answer any questions you might have about the menu, comfy space to sit and hang out for awhile.  Prices are what's expected in the Finance hub. 

All in all, a decent experience that I'd be willing to repeat again."}
{"text":"Surprisingly decent food - not your typical pub food. The service is chill but attentive. The burger, calamari (with a delicious slaw), wings, and apps were all really good."}
{"text":"I came here on their #TacoTuesday night where they had the $2 taco (chicken, beef, shrimp) special and $4.50 Modelo beer.

The server mentioned the specials when he first came, which was good, so we were able to order the specials right away, which is what we came for.

I ordered one beef and one shrimp taco plus a modelo beer. The tacos came pretty fast -- this should've been a warning sign (red lights flashing)! The tacos were cold, and it wasn't just because of the coleslaw. Even the beef on the beef taco was cold! Where did this beef come from? The shrimp, which was fried, wasn't exactly hot as well as it should be when freshly fried.

The portions were sad too. There was only one small piece of shrimp on the taco, which pretty much covers 1/3 the taco. Great, now I get to eat wrapper and veggies for the 2/3 of the taco. The same goes for the beef. I would much rather pay $3.50 for El Caballito's taco tuesday special where I know my money is going somewhere.

When the tacos came, the server asked if we wanted to order something else. We decided to split a Lamb Rogan Josh. Guess what? It came out so fast again! What's good is they split the dish for us into two plates and the portions divided evenly in two. But you can tell it's not freshly made as it came out in a matter of minutes from when we ordered. It seems like it was just microwaved, and not even long enough as the dish was warm instead of hot.

Oh well, at least the beer was good."}
{"text":"I came here for a mutual friends birthday and had a really good time. It was hard to find at first, since it's hidden within a large corporate building but once you get settled in, it's a great venue. On Saturday (possibly other days) they have live music. The band playing was fantastic and they were playing old school rock. It was awesome, since our group was 30+. 

The birthday was held in the back of the restaurant, which had been reserved for our group. It was a good size with tables and room to get up, dance and socialize. The food platters that were brought out were really good and the service was great. Towards the end of the night we discovered they had a patio outside. The patio was fantastic!  I wish we found it sooner. 

If you come here for live music or the patio in the summer you won't be disappointed. 

Last call on Saturday is around midnight or shortly after. Some of my friends found this to be slightly early but we were in the financial district. Allover, we all had a wonderful time and I would return to this bar for live music and drinks. :)"}
{"text":"my fave place to hang out after work. good food and beer selection. servers and bartenders are top notch. the new reno opens everything up."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing experience at Merchant. Ordered the Cajun chicken and what I got was about 4 bites of cold chicken on top of a bowl of rice and under cooked lentils. The lone bright spot of this place is that the service was very good. Unfortunately, I will not be going again since there are several better options at this price point in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection (along with some ciders). Service was friendly. The food was not so good. In our group of five, the best item was the burger, and two of the meals were missing key parts. I'd come back for beer, but eat elsewhere (as there are TONS of options nearby)."}
{"text":"Here for my birthday dinner. Catfish super super salty, like heart attack salty! They got my friend's chicken club order wrong and she had to wait a half hour for it.  food runner who first delivered wrong order was rude and unapologetic. unimpressed. DJ is fab though."}
{"text":"This place is just average. Nothing special. The menu is limited to just a few items but there are a lot of drinks on the menu. 

Food was ok. Burger was decent but small for the price and fish was $22 worth of breading with a tiny hint of halibut. It did come with a lot of coleslaw though which was just average. 

Drinks are about average price but there are other places in the vicinity that are a few bucks cheaper. Lunch for two with a beer each will run you about $65 so you're better off going someone else if you are hungry."}
{"text":"This is your usual downtown pub - lively, good service, mid-20's to 40's crowd, beer options, and good variety of food. Moreso a 3.5 than 4 stars. 

They were promoting Old Tomorrow beer, so we got some free samples of beer and food (amazing ribs). Pretty cool. 

Food wise, we ordered the southern fried chicken and the gnocchi. I thought the gnocchi was good, but the onions weren't caramelized enough. The southern fried chicken was really good, but my friends weren't a huge fan of the corn bread. Portions were great for the price. Check out their menu, there's plenty on it that looked good!

Overall, if I was in the area and looking for a gastropub, I would come here again."}
{"text":"Just stopped in town for this week! Wow! I got the fisherman's catch to eat, it's extremely filling and tastes very fresh. Also tried the KLB raspberry wheat beer. I normally don't go for flavored beer but it was so subtle and delicious! Grant was a fabulous bartender and answered all of my tourist questions. They have free Wi-Fi, which us a huge plus for a transient!"}
{"text":"Work lunch with the boss we decided to try a relatively new place right by the office.  The Merchant is a new bar focusing on seafood gastronomy with a few classic pub fares to cater to the general clientele.
The interior is clean, contemporary with a lovely patio facing Adelaide street.
For the mains I took our servers recommendation and tried their in house traditional fish and chips.
I've got to say, bang for buck, their portions are huge. Luckily I opted to have more slaw then fries I was still unable to finish my meal lol. However the meal was delish, fish was fresh and not overly battered. Fries were not oily and the slaw was awesome and definitely complimented the dish...definitely a 5/5.
Service was excellent and the overall experience was lovely! I'll definitely be back to try a few more menu items."}
{"text":"Some of my softball league members and Coworkers have work functions at The Merchant often. Its a great place to hangout after work if you are in the entertainment/financial district of Toronto. They have a good selection of drinks a decent food. There's always a pretty good crowd and a DJ on Friday nights who actually plays what you request of him. There are some DJs out there that are closed minded and play only what they want.

Overall the Merchant is a pretty chill place for small or big groups. I'd recommend checking it out for yourself to see if it's your cup of tea. JimStar Out!!!"}
{"text":"I was invited to join a group of work friends to this restaurant, which they hadn't been to since it had been converted from a typical pub. The lack of traditional pub food was disappointing to most of us, but we went ahead and picked a couple of things off the somewhat limited menu.

We ordered the P.E.I. Nachos, which is \"kettle chips, tomato, jalapeño, salsa, olives, and cheddar sauce.\" We also ordered the calamari. Starting with the latter, it was a fairly typical version of this dish. But there was absolutely nothing special or interesting about it. It could've come straight out of a pre-prepared bag, as far as we knew. It was also delivered to our table far from hot, as though it had been just sitting there waiting to be picked up.

The P.E.I. Nachos fared much worse, surprisingly enough. The chips themselves were fine, but the toppings were subpar and sparse. There was an entire side of the dish that was just naked chips, which kind of blew us all away. How does this happen? And, like the calamari, the plate was served lukewarm (at best).

The ambiance and service was fine, and they've got a decent selection of beer, so I'd return just to drink. But I don't think I'd order the food again."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a work lunch just before 12pm- was a little concerned because it was very dead and it didn't look like there were any other patrons other than my table. As it got closer to 12:30, the place really started filling up. 

Our server was super new but we would have never known if he hadn't told us- service was friendly, thoughtful and attentive. 

After confirming that both the smoked chicken and gnocchi was made in-house, I chose the smoked chicken gnocchi in porcini mushroom broth, mushrooms, tomato, cream, garlic, caramelized onions w/ a sprinkle of Parmesan. This was a delicious pasta dish and I was really surprised by the quality (given that it was a pub).

My co-worker got the cod cakes w/ lemon tartar and the turkey pie w/ fries- he said that both were good (he finished all of his food).

To top it all off, the chef (or owner) came by our table to check on us- he told us which of his sous chefs prepared which dish and you could just tell that he was proud of the food coming out of his kitchen. I was very impressed.

I can understand some of the reviews here saying that the menu is on the expensive side, however, I think that for the location, food items are priced about right. There are good deals on drinks- there was a special today for $5.50 Stella which is a fantastic price, especially given the area.

I would definitely come here again for a work lunch- the staff are friendly, the food is good and the location is wonderful."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper at the Merchant last night.

It was such a nice afternoon and we sat on the patio.

Until March, it was a Fionn McCool's.  It still has the same owner and staff.  They have totally renovated the restaurant.

Gord ordered the Canadian Cod Sandwich special with a salad, which he said was really good.  He'd get it again.

I had Chicken Curry Jalfrezi and it was just okay.  It was kind of cold and there wasn't a lot of chicken.  I didn't think it was worth $18 and I wouldn't get it again.

Service was a bit sketchy at first but then Ricardo and Ciaran took excellent care of us."}
{"text":"I needed a quick bite and glass of wine. I'm in Toronto for business. I had the Poutine- tender short ribs, cheese curds, merlot Demi. I'm from DC and I think the U.S. Needs to get it together and put cheese curds on everything. Ryan was my bartender and was friendly and attentive. Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"I had such great expectations. Everything looked right. But in the end this place has succumbed to mediocrity. A shame."}
{"text":"It's quite a neighbourhood pub although in a busy financial district corner. The recent changed ownership makes it worthwhile to check this place out again. The waitress who was serving our table was efficient and attentive.
For a Friday night, it's not as busy seated inside. But the patio was full outside. 
Nachos was good and you can't go wrong with calamari. Good array of beer in bottle and tap. Cocktails are mediocre...  Drink pricing is affordable and certainly not too expensive."}
{"text":"This place is very very close to my office.It is across the street actually.
I reserved this place for my husband's birthday for around 15 people.
When we arrived,they had a big mirror with the birthday greeting written for my husband which was quite impressive.
It is like any other normal bar though.The food menu is very general and nothing great or out of the box
The servers were very nice and helpful and friendly  which I apprecitated since we had people continuosly coming and leaving and 
they were quick in settling bills.
Also we were switching seats a lot which they did not mind like some places where they tell you strictly to stick to your seat.
Overall good epxerience but nothing that sets this as  special or makes me wanna go there again."}
{"text":"It was cold in Toronto and I'd successfully made it from the airport to my hotel (Hilton) without going outside.  With only a hoodie between me and the freezing cold, I did not relish going outside.  But hunger drove me from my hotel and as I walked toward the PATH, still in the heated confines of an office building attached to the Hilton, I saw the Merchant.

I figured a pub lunch wouldn't be too bad and it wasn't.  Sat down at the bar and was promptly served by a friendly bartender.  I just had a chicken sandwich and fries.  The food was okay.  Fries were a little limp and cold and the grilled chicken was a little dry but the bread that it was served on was actually delicious!

Price was reasonable and the place was very clean.  Definitely a three star experience."}
