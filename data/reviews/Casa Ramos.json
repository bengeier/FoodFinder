{"text":"We had a great meal and excellent service.  Very friendly, attentive staff.  Always keeping our drinks filled, chips full and stopping by our table.  Would highly recommend.  Thank you Casa Ramos!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves absolutely delicious food!  I usually get the Chicken Fajitas and without a doubt is the best anywhere!  Staff is very friendly, attentive, and accommodating.  The salsa is \"muy delicioso\"!  Even the decor is great! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place is a must! Excellent food.... Great Service and the margaritas are amazing."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! Very clean establishment! Wonderful and friendly service. This place is now my # 1 choice for GREAT Mexican food. My family loved it so much we ate there again in less than 24 hours and tried different food to make sure they didn't have something we may  like better. We didn't, because the food and service was just as good as the night before.  I will tell everyone I know about this place, they deserve my advertising!  5 STARS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place.  you have got to try the Carne Asada Nacho.  So wonderful.  Their Salsa is fantastic."}
{"text":"Usually I don't leave reviews on Yelp (For good or bad places, but I need to try and change that...) At any rate, I ordered a dish to go from Casa Ramos. It was delicious! I got the Burrito Colorado which was a burrito served enchilada style with perfectly tender chunks of beef, red pepper, and sweet cabbage. This place has some of the best Mexican rice I've had in a while, and the refried beans were delicious as well. Overall, I recommend it! DO NOT let the state of the neighborhood sway you away-- this is quality cooking."}
{"text":"great food and lots of it for the price.  Good service.  Been back a few times, and so have family members.  Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!! Huge portions for great price! Seriously good Mexican food, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Me and my partner just discovered this amazing restaurant the pollo de la creama is absolutely amazing the dinner plates are huge and always hot and fresh the salsa and chips are wonderful I highly highly recommend casa Ramos if you want the best tasting Mexican food with a authentic feel and great service"}
{"text":"I think its a little overrated personally... but main dish was good and for the price its very good... chips have a weird oily taste and cold... salsa is good mild and hot... best item was beans and rice. Shredded beef was good too..."}
{"text":"Fajitas for dos was delicious! Probably one of the best I ever had! Prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"Had the Birria De Chivo, definitely one of the better ones I've had. Good flavor and the goat tasted fresh. It was busy but worth the wait"}
{"text":"You will never go home on an empty stomach. Great authentic Mexican food, and wonderful service. The decor is amazing, try and catch the live music too."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant based on good ratings on yelp last weekend.  The environment was nice. The food was so so. We had a cheese crispy, pollo asada and vegetarian  mexican dish. Also salsa and chips. Service was fair. We both had serious stomach issues a few hours later that has taken several days to recover. I will use Maricopa. Gov  inspection info rather than ratings here  on yelp to decide on new restaurants going forward."}
{"text":"The chile relleno & enchiladas in red sauce are awesome! The staff is wonderful; helpful & nice. My husband loves the chipotle chicken, & the shredded beef tacos. The food is home made, & down to earth. We have taken family & friends there. Everyone loved the food!"}
{"text":"Second time I have eaten here. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Food was disgusting! Totally  flavorless chimichanga, which by the way was the smallest thing I've ever seen and salsa was gross. Never have I have had to add salt to any Mexican food I have ever purchased before until now. Ultimately I threw my entire meal out, it was that bad. You have been un-bookmarked, my friend."}
{"text":"We are Mexican food snobs and we love this place! Authentic family run restaurant. They care about service and food. Loved the Burrito Colorado. The table salsa is excellent."}
{"text":"Unique and delicious Mexican food.  The shrimp dishes are our favorites, and Ben and Kenny are always up for new ideas.  I'm a little bias, though ... we have been dining at the Heber, AZ Casa Ramos since the day it opened. Friday, my mojo de ajo in the very nice Mesa location was perfect and then some. And the Cruz blanco margaritas might replace our normal Patrones in the future."}
{"text":"Didn't like it, my Chili Relleno was so tough I couldn't even cut through it with a knive. The Red Chile meat was chewy."}
{"text":"This is by far the best mexican restaurant my husband and I have had in AZ. The chips and salsa are delicious. He always orders the chipotle cream shrimp and I like to change it up. I can't complain about their shrimp cocktails, enchiladas, molcajete, or shrimp dishes. Everything is delicious. Love the margaritas! And micheladas! Service is great too.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"If anyone EVER gives this place a low mark, then they do not know good Mexican food.  Service is always perfect; Kenny knows what we order to drink as soon as he sees us enter.  Special requests for unique dishes are honored with no problem--my husband likes the marinated meat they use for Tacos Pastor, but prefers to have it in a burrito version--no problem. I have tried a variety of different dishes but can't beat the price of the Burrito Colorado--ala carte with no rice and beans they only charge $3.50! Are you kidding? After I indulge on all the chips and salsa, I can barely finish it--so delicious and large portions.  I almost hate to give raving reviews because then our little secret restaurant becomes too popular, but I want to see Kenny succeed, so I will. You will not be unsatisfied."}
{"text":"hands down top of the line establishment. Everything is so clean, service is excellent, and the food is amazing. You can seriously taste and see the freshness of everything. Anything you order will be great. I highly recomend the mexican pizza. first class mexican food"}
{"text":"When I give a review based on stars it is for the cost of the meal. So, where the average meal is something like ten to fifteen dollars (as it is here) it might get less stars if the cost was say twenty or fifty dollars a meal. That being said, for the price this is simply the best mexican restaurant in the east valley. I haven't had anything here (and I've eaten here dozens of times) that isn't top notch. chips and salsa, buritos,enchiladdas, chimmies, you name it, it is all really good. If the price was twice as high I'd still give it four stars, service is great too."}
{"text":"Great food, great value.  Check out their lunch menu if you get a chance, it's crazy cheap.  This place is definitely a hidden Gem.  The location is not fantastic.  But if you want great Mexican food, at a great price, Casa Ramos is the ticket."}
{"text":"Service - Other than the nice young man who promptly delivered chips and salsa to our table, the service was very poor.  We waited for about 15 minutes before even placing our  order and the place was not very busy.  Food - Mediocre at best.  But, in fairness, what we consider wonderful, others might consider very good.  We went to this restaurant based on many good Yelp reviews.  Sometimes Yelp comes through for us and sometimes not."}
{"text":"The margaritas here are the best!! Everything I have ordered her has been very good. The first time I ate at this place, it was up north in Payson on the rim and I have loved it ever since. I am so glad I found this location here in Mesa!"}
{"text":"I eat here very often and let me tell you the food is amazing! Never have I been disappointed.  I highly recommend it. Service is great. Everyone with something bad to say about this place is insane. Love, love, love casa ramos!  Give this place a try. You wont be let down!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Tamales were meaty and delicious. The cheese and onion enchiladas were just like I remembered from grade school. Oh man. Definitely going back!! Thanks to the staff for a wonderful dining experience. Oh and be sure to try the churros. If there's still room after your meal!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and service is even better. Best margaritas! They make the base ahead with real limes - very tasty."}
{"text":"We had a great meal. I had the Chile Relleno & Chimichanga, and my husband had the enchilada & taco combo plate. Everything was delicious. Their warm chips and salsa were really good too. I think the best part of our dining experience was the great service. Our waiter was Victor, he was so friendly, and provided great service, we will be back."}
{"text":"I came here during the Lunch hour, and at first I was a little apprehensive about the place. It was completely empty, but reviews said it was good, so my Dad and I went in. The chips and salsa were excellent. I usually never find the \"house\" salsas of restaurants to be hot enough for me, but this one was spot on. I ordered chicken enchiladas and I was pleasantly surprised at how good they were! The chicken was shredded, moist, and nicely seasoned. The enchilada sauce itself was smooth, slightly spicy, and pretty good overall. The rice served with the dish was also very good. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"In Mesa to defrost for a few days and wanted Mexican food.  Got pointed to Casa Ramos by Yelp! (thanks).  Our server Marsha was attentive, friendly, and professional.  5 stars for her.  The outside of the place doesn't inspire confidence - on the other hand, you don't eat outside.  The decor is, well, kitchy.   The place is clean, the food is really good, and the people are friendly.  Portions are large.  Food is hot (including the chips).  The salsa was was better than a chain Mexican place.  All that and the prices are very fair.  Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"We walked in and were immediately greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere. My wife had the taco salad and I had the chili relleno w/ a small bean and cheese burrito, enchilada style. The white cheese oozed out as soon as I cut into the relleno. Side note...if you tear into one of these bad boys and cheddar spills out, run the other way! My wife kept scooping the enchilada sauce off my plate at telling me how good it was. The signage out front reads \"Authentic Mexican Food\" and authentic it was!  **Edit (minus a star) The service was on point, as it always is! We had the same server and he is phenomenal!! The chili relleno, was not. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the same. My wife got the taco salad again and she also agreed that there was something off. Maybe it was a different cook? IDK, but I do know that consistency is key. If you want to depend on repeat customers, they need to be able to depend on you. We'll be back and I'll be ordering the chili relleno, again!  :)"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. Started coming here on a 2 for 1 coupon deal and have been hooked ever since. Prices are very reasonable, food is very delectable and service is more than excellent. I've tried a few different dinners from the menu and have not been disappointed. I'm not into rice but my significant other makes me order it because she says it's the best restaurant rice she's had. She also loves their frozen strawberry marguerites (on occasion too much). Give them a try if you love a menu with a lot of choices, Mexican food that is nothing less than yummy and friendly service. If I could rate Casa Ramos higher than 5 I'd give them a 10 out of 10."}
{"text":"Out of towners, used yelp to find this gem.  What sold me was \"clean\"  and \"large portions\".  All very true. The meal was just as we like it. Salsa was outstanding with a slight kick.  Service was good, and the waitress a joy.  Would most definitely come back if again in Mesa."}
{"text":"Dime a dozen. Thought that with the high Yelp ratings it would be good, it's below average. Worst part was service. No one seems to be able to make any decision without talking with someone first."}
{"text":"My daughters and I ate here for the first time last Saturday. We got there later in the evening -- around 8 or so and it was packed.  There were two giant parties of, easily, 2 dozen or more people. To make a long story short, the food was great -- really great.  My favorite is cheese enchiladas and their enchiladas really the best I recall ever having. My daughters enjoyed their dishes, one had the shredded beef taco Kid's Meal and my eldest daughter had the Enchiladas Crema. The serving size of our plates was very generous and the prices were very reasonable.   However, the one downside to our experience was that it took 45 or more minutes for us to get our food because, unfortunately, the two massive tables of people got there just before us and so they were getting, naturally, their food before us. Can't really fault the restaurant for our bad timing. I guess the only thing I would do different next time is to ask what's taking so long earlier than I did. It would have been nice if our server would have given us a heads-up about how long it was going to take for us to get our food as well.   I read a few recent reviews of this restaurant before I wrote this one and I was shocked to see many, too many, comments about Caucasians being favored over  Non-Caucasians or vice-versa or the diners being primarily Caucasian or vice-versa.  I didn't notice any kind of favoritism or lack thereof toward any particular race or culture while my daughters and I were there.  I also didn't notice any kind of segregation of customers based on their race or culture, either.  As far as I can see, none of the comments along these lines are based on factual and accurate observations.  Our server was always attentive and friendly and we have a very pleasant experience.    In closing, my entire Family and I are headed back to this restaurant right after l finish writing this review because I want my wife to have the pleasure of dining at one of the best Mexican Restaurants we've, at least, have been to in quite a while."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican in the East Valley.  This is a hidden gem - for a long time, I drove by, not even thinking it was open, or even realizing it was a restaurant!  Its located in a fairly tired section of Mesa's Main Street, which is the only thing keeping it from packing its doors.  The cuisine is consistently good.  The chips and salsa are fresh and clearly home-made.  The pricing is reasonable.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  And its never busy (not a positive for the owners, I know, but great if you have hyper kids)."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place so many times and always thought I should stop and check it out. Well I did tonight and all I can say is WOW!! I wish I would have stopped and discovered this place the first time I seen it. Food is amazing, portions are insanely big, and the prices are incredible. I ordered the #1: 3 enchiladas with choice of shredded beef or cheese, with rice and beans for $9.25 which your probably thinking might not be that great of a deal but when you see the size of the plate/portion you will know what I'm talking about. I had 1 1/2 enchiladas and rice and beans (totally stuffed)and still took home the same amount of food if not more than a combo plate at Fili B's. This place is incredible don't let the area fool ya this place is truly amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food around you can't beat the lunch specials Huge Portions at a Great Price I Highly Recommend the Chili Colorado burro Delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are not a couple of seniors or a big family you will get IGNORED entirely. I dont like to beg for a refill or beg to place my orrder, and for a box and for the bill. I had to stop the buss boy twice - to get my order taken (after 30 minutes of waiting, drink all my soda and we finished the chips) and the 2nd time I stopped him was to get the bill and a box. The only time I saw a waiter was after I told the buss boy to take my order please.  The food was good but service very disappointing. I will never come back because of the service and I am an excellent tipper but this time I left 2 cents."}
{"text":"We waited over 30 minutes after ordering to get our order! When the food came, the rice and sauce was crusted and dry from sitting to long under the warmer. I returned my food  with only an apology from the wait staff and the manager didn't come over to see if anything could be done. I will not come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, the chips and salsa were delicious. I ordered a green chili chimichanga it contained large chunks of meat, they definately are not stingy on the portion size.  The restaurant was very clean and the decor was nicely done. I would definitely return and recommend this restaurant  the food was very authentic."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I think of it as a diamond in the rough. I have been going here for a few years and it's still by far my favorite Mexican food spots. I'd recommend their appetizer queso, carne asada entree or camarones al mojo de ajo. On Friday evenings they have a live mariachi band. I only give it 4 stars versus 5 due to their servers needing to be better trained but it definitely doesn't take away from their food quality."}
{"text":"I was suggested Blue Adobe Grill for Mexican food. When I walked into the joint, no Mexican servers, cooks or customers! Food looked Americanized and I walked out!  I looked up Yelp and found this place. Even though it was 6 miles away, I was more than happy, that I choose to come here!!  The place has a wonderful atmosphere! Mexican decorations, music, servers and cooks! The servers where super friendly and willing to give good suggestions to food! The food was great and the happy hour for beer was awesome!  If you are looking for GOOD Mexican food.... then you want to come here! I would come again in a heart beat if I was in the area for work again!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Mexican food in a fun atmosphere in the East Valley this is it. Chips & Salsa and beans and rice here are solid, but the Talpiquena (carne asada and shrimp sauteed with mushroom and garlic) is deliciosa! Most of the entrees are served on huge plates that come piping hot to the table. Service is hit or miss, but most of the guy servers are really good. The homemade flautas are yummy as well."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. My boys love their chips and salsa. I can't get over how delicious their refried beans are. If you want great Mexican and a great price this is the place!"}
{"text":"Pretty good and very tasty. The atmosphere is unique (though the booth seats are mucho uncomfortable), the service is great, the food is pretty good, I had a tamale and a shredded beef taco combo and was very pleased with my order. If I'm in the neighborhood, I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"We love the seafood dishes, the shrimp wrapped in bacon (apretalados) is my wife's favorite, just had the whole fish (mojarra rellena); really good.  Seafood in Mesa is really hit and miss, looks like we found a way to satisfy the seafood itch in Mesa"}
{"text":"My wife and I just had our wedding rehearsal dinner at Casa Ramos 1 week ago today and they were awesome. We picked Casa Ramos because it is by far the best Mexican Food in the country. Seriously. The restaurant is a very clean and modern, sit down, family style, we even go for special occasions type of place. We first found them on our way to showlow, we stopped at their restaurant in heber. We were blown away by it. We loved food as well as the service, atmosphere, and Margaritas. They had a sign inside that said \"visit our mesa location\". We saw that it was just a few miles from our house and we now only go one place for Mexican food. And so began our love story with Casa Ramos.  So of course, when we were planning our wedding rehearsal dinner, I came to the manager Kenny and told him we had 50 people(which ended up being 55). I told him our needs and they made a special menu just for us. They have a room for partying and fit all of us comfortably. The price was very affordable, especially when feeding 55 people. The food was delicious as always. They have a bar that connects to the party room so our out of town friends and family were all delighted. They really loved it. They can put down some drinks too, they had those bartenders working hard. Shout out to Juan and the other employees for there awesome service, perfect margaritas and mixed drinks. Juan even gave my wife and I any Margarita we wanted on the house as I wedding gift. Thank you all so much. You guys rocked it! See you again real soon."}
{"text":"I know this has been given a CLOSED status. And Technically, they are correct. But the only reason they are closed is during all the torn up construction on Main St for the extension of the light rail.  I am on the mailing list, to receive notification when they open again AFTER the construction is done. Hopefully sometime by the end of the year!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. I come from Los Angeles, And good authentic Mexican food is very hard to come by in Mesa AZ. I have tried multiple dishes, they are all great. Great service. Great Mexican music. Great decor."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food place. Period. I am never let down with the overall quality of the food & staff."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Arizonan!!! Come here every time we come to town. Juan and the gang are wonderful servers. The food and drinks and decor are fabulous!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a fancy building, but it does have its own little parking lot.  Two of us went on a Wednesday night and there was only one other table of people.  (Which I don't mind since it was later in the evening during the middle of the week).    While reading the menu, a small ant crawled across it.  I didn't see any others on the table though.  Chips and salsa were dropped off immediately soon followed by our waitress to take our drink order.  They don't tell you, but if you ask, they also have mild and hot (green based) salsa.  The one they bring automatically is a medium salsa.  None were crazy hot and my heat tolerance isn't that high, but they did have a little kick.  The salsas were ok.  The mild had tomatoes, onions, and typical salsa stuff, but also tasted like tomato sauce.  I ordered the Combination Plate #5 (chimichanga & chille relleno) with shredded beef for $10.25.  This comes with rice &  refried beans.  When I asked about choices of beans I think the waitress said they have the refried or whole pinto beans.  They do not have black beans.  My husband ordered the #17 (Chalupa, Tostada & Chimichanga) with red chile beef for $11.25.  Rice and beans were ok (the beans were a little watery).  My chile relleno tasted good and was big but was very greasy, the batter was soggy because of the grease.  It was topped with some sort of red sauce that tasted like spaghetti sauce.  The Chimichanga consisted of shredded beef wrapped in the tortilla and fried, that's it.  No lettuce, tomatoes, cheese or anything else (you can pay to add sour cream and guacamole).  There was a little pile on the plate that seemed to be pickled cabbage.  My shredded beef and my husband's red chile beef both tasted like a typical american pot roast.  Out of his 3 items, he liked his Chalupa the best.  That being said, none of the food was bad, it just wasn't what we are looking for in Mexican food.  I'm trying to find a Mexican restaurant that doesn't have that canned tomato sauce flavor in the salsa and sauces.  I would also like there to be something else on the Chimichanga like sour cream, sauce, lettuce or cheese or something included for $10.25.  I'd say its worth trying out once, maybe your taste buds will like this style, everyone's taste is different."}
{"text":"Saw reviews thought I would give it a try. went here last night had a red chili chimi was great. will be my knew favorite Mexican restaurant. loved the chips and salsa, service was great and food reminded me of home. Will be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants...very consistent in quality of food.  Always hot and tasty.   Their taquitos are the best I've ever had.  We just got outstanding service from Juan...be sure and ask for him#"}
{"text":"Okay, I've given this place several times to redeem itself and every time it was NOT the same. This is sad, back in 2012 this place was great! Not sure what happened at the end of 2013 and all of 2014.   Sad."}
{"text":"One of the rare places in Phoenix that actually serves my favorite Mexican dish. Salsa was not very hot but the service was great. Sketchy part of town but worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Horrible. The service was slow. The food wasn't any good. It is pretty expensive for what it is. Very disappointed. After seeing the rating in yelp I was expecting a lot better  of a restaurant."}
{"text":"I saw Casa Ramos on Eight's Check, Please! Arizona and I just had to go there.  I went with my parents tonight, and since it was the night after the airing of the show, the place was packed.  We waited a little while for our table, then ordered.  We shared a Cheese Crispy, golden brown and tasty. My dad ordered a Carne Asada burrito enchilada-style with rice and refried beans, which he enjoyed.  I got the Camarones a la Plancha: good-sized grilled shrimp and sautéed mushrooms in a garlic butter sauce served with rice and whole pinto beans.  Absolutely delicious!    My mom planned on ordering something else, but after seeing a flaming, sizzling skillet across the room, she ordered the Fajitas Mixta: large shrimp, scallops and tilapia sautéed with bell peppers and onions, which she thought was delicious. Problem: the skillet wasn't sizzling when it got to her, and it took a while to get our silverware. We spoke with management, who reminded us how busy they were (jeez, not like we couldn't see that!), but did us a solid by comping the fajitas and assuring us we'd have better service next time.  Just as we finished our meals, my mom reminded me about the flan and how good it looked on TV.  We got one and... oh Lord... it was bomb, like bomb.com.  I can't believe how good and creamy that flan was with that caramel sauce, the vanilla... it's the best I've ever had and we ordered another one to go.  I was thinking \"all is forgiven!\" with a mouthful of flan but then I wouldn't be a very good yelper if I didn't mention what happened, right?  Had it not been for that, this would be a five-star review.  That being said, I would definitely go back, it's my new favorite Mexican restaurant!  BTW, to Rosario, our server: thanks, you rock!"}
{"text":"Food is very good, staff is friendly. Building is kind of run down and the neighborhood is questionable at night."}
{"text":"Ok....dinner time at same restaurant. I am so very disappointed. The burrito I ordered was falling apart with red sauce just dumped on...I took 2 or 3 bites and that was all she wrote. The rice and beans were very dry and unappetizing. When I told the server, he got a huge attitude with me and tried to tell me it was cause I was in the restroom when food came and it had been sitting for too long (5mins).   I then requested to speak to the manager who also sat arguing with me that we were the only ones in the whole restaurant who had complained about it. That to me is not good customer service. He very ungratefully said \"I will give you a discount if that's why you are complaining\"  I tried to explain that that was not why I complained. I was just letting them know. Finally my husband cut in and said \"yes we will take the discount\"    I can honestly say they lost a customer tonight."}
{"text":"Wow, they should call the vegetarian combo the anorexic plate.  It was good, but very small.  And the bean burrito was made with charro beans, which also are served as a side.  WTF? Who puts charro beans in a tortilla and calls it a bean burrito? And my quesadilla was good, but they gave me 4 tiny little triangles of it.  I'm still hungry after eating enough charro beans to achieve lift off, and I'm left craving some good ol lardy refried beans and cheese wrapped up together in God's perfect combo.  I spent dinner eyeballing my husband's tiny steak like my cat eyes my tuna snack.  Another disappointing Mexican food experience for my list, I'm afraid.  Not because the food was nasty, but because I'm gonna have to leave here and go get a taco."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here multiple times and have always enjoyed.  My wife's favorites are the peach margarita and fajita burrito.  I have tried multiple items, including the Chicken Mole, and enjoyed them all."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant we eat here at least a couple of times a month. The mushroom appetizer is my favorite awesome garlic butter flavor . We love the pork carnitas but we have never had a bad meal there every time is outstanding.... Original atmosphere perfect for a night out in dining.... one of our favorites in the valley.... My husband loves the chicken enchiladas with their red sauce.... I try new things every time we go.... Always friendly , great service...."}
{"text":"I love Casa Ramos! The food here is amazing.  Very quick service. All food comes on piping hot plates so it stays hot while eating. Each person gets their own mini carafe of AMAZING salsa. I've been here many times and never had a bad experience. I can't recommend them enough. And the prices/value are incredible. There are so many other sub-par Mexican places and this one is a gem in my experience."}
{"text":"Very good food! My servers were friendly and funny. One guy asked me if I wanted to try the hotter green salsa. When he brought it back he said, \"be careful of the fire.\" Haha. Love it. Our food was great and huge portions. I had 1 shredded beef enchilada and a bean tostada. Unlimited amount of chips at the table, too. We will be back. P.s. the bathrooms were very clean, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"This has become our regular Sunday Night fix. Great Tacos, I recommend the Chile Verde. Great margarita, chips & salsa...what else can you ask for? Service is competent and friendly. Have tried other dishes which are great, but the tacos I crave!  P.S. ask for the hot green salsa!"}
{"text":"Anytime I am craving good Mexican food I head to Casa Ramos. Yelp reviews got me in the door but the food has kept me coming back and recommending this place to anyone who will listen to me.   The staff is super friendly, the ambiance is great and the food........i can't even begin to tell you how delicious it truly is. You must try it for yourself.   Recommendations: Pollo a la Crema, Chile Relleno and Pork Enchilada's. (Honestly, I don't know if you could go wrong with anything on their menu.)"}
{"text":"Que sabrosa!! Why there aren't more Mexican restaurants of this caliber in the Phoenix area is beyond me. The house margarita was better than expected. My husband and I split the Especialidad de la Casa ($14.50). We got through about 2/3 of it (huge portions) and it was delicious! Tasted as good as our friends' authentic cooking. Also a festive and clean atmosphere. It's a bit of a shame that its in a rougher neighborhood. Lock your car. Otherwise, go in hungry and prepare to be delighted. :-)"}
{"text":"The fajits are good but the flammin plate is really good, Steak, chicken and shrimp with really good marinades."}
{"text":"When you walk into Casa Ramos you think your walking into a Mexican fortress. It was amusing to see these little statues of roosters, bulls and a ox with its(private parts) showing while I was waiting for our food.As far as the meal tasted the chips and salsa were good and  plentiful. I had the fish taco's made with tilapia. It was cubed and very flavorful. The dish comes with rice and refried beans but I had rancho beans (muy bien). My wife had the veggie fajitas also that came with the side of rice and beans. Portions are a good size and the value of the meal is good on the wallet. I will be a repeat customer in the future."}
{"text":"Tried the pork carnitas plate on my first visit.  It came on a very large platter, and was an interesting spread of food.  Rice and beans were average, but the flavor of the pork was very good. I'd probably go back here and explore the menu further when in the Mesa area. Above average."}
{"text":"My friend wasn't feeling well and went by myself.  They were closing early for a private party but arrived around 6 pm (2+ hours before closing). Not sure who was my server, seemed like I was being bounced around between 3 servers.  They were all male.  Seemed like they wanted to rush me out because I don't drink alcoholic beverages. Once my order was taken food came quickly.  Food was very good. Not the run the mill same ole Mexican restaurant. Price is reasonable for a good portion. Couldn't finish dinner and put left over in a take home container.  And ordered flan, because I heard theirs is excellent.  It was gritty. The server said they were slammed on flan and this was the third batch today. Half way through found the perfect silky and creamy flan.  The cooks had rushed the tempering of the eggs and curled part of the flan base. I ate around the \"perfect\" flan leaving it for last. 2/3 was curled or gritty and 1/3 was silky.  The flavor was excellent but disappointed because of the gritty part.  I would have accepted \"sold out\" instead of \"less than perfect\" and ordered a different dessert. I asked the server not to clear the table because I needed to use the restroom. Returning to my table it had been cleared with left overs taken away. The server brought it to me upside down, he obviously took out of the garbage. This I why I gave 2 stars.  I usually don't leave poor reviews, however the restaurant was half empty, they rushed me and didn't leave my food on the table.   I should have been given an apology and credit on my next meal and not my food pulled from garbage. I placed a 23% tip on the check before going to the restroom.  I had planned to, but didn't, leave some additional cash because I worked my way through college on tips. I am not sure whether this had anything to do with the service, but servers kept speaking to me in Spanglish.  I informed them that I don't speak Spanglish. And they gave me a \"sour face\". I am going to give them one more try next time with a friend..."}
{"text":"Like a previous reviewer shared a month ago...something has gone terribly wrong with this restaurant!  We have enjoyed going to Casa Ramos for years, but we will NEVER go back and we are so disappointed. I've  had to ponder what/how to write this and stay objective.  Recently we had a multi family gathering at our favorite family owned Mexican establishment in Mesa.  The food was in short - horrible. Nothing was its normal fresh self.  It was as if a lot of our food was frozen and reheated. One item in particular (a salad) was served in a way I had never had it before - smothered in a stale/smelling powdered cheese.  I immediately sent the salad back (again - a first at that restaurant.)  10 mins later this goon of a man came to our table and \"confronted\" me about the salad. He looked like he was other strung out on something and/or hadn't slept in days.  This man berated me in front of our large group stating I was wasting their food, that I had ordered the salad and I (the customer!) need to \"read the menu more carefully!\"  Apparently he worked in the kitchen and felt compelled to come out to confront me.  Seriously?!  We were all so uncomfortable that we finished our meal and summarily decided that we will NEVER go back to this place again. There's several other restaurants around a favorite family gathering place we have near there that we will start to frequent instead of Casa Ramos now.  Our very kind waitress was obviously embarrassed and pleaded with me to allow them to make me a replacement meal - even if I wanted it to-go.  There was no way I was going to trust that shady man in the kitchen to prepare anything for me or my family ever again.   We won't let that bully of a kitchen worker ruin the many wonderful family memories we have at Casa Ramos...but we will never spend another dime there again. There's plenty of other family owned places around there that would love to be gracious hosts and not be incredibly rude to loyal patrons."}
{"text":"Great authentic atmosphere.  Good menu selection.   Great portions.   I would comeback in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Just went back after not visiting for a while. Loved it! We got tons of attention and wonderful service. We had really great food and loved the salsa. Definitely worth the visit and great pricing."}
{"text":"We we're served fermented salsa.  Unfortunately our 1.5 yr old didn't spot it.  When mom tasted it after a few minutes she freaked out a bit.  Serving spoiled food should is a huge problem!  At this point, the waiter should have been profusely apologizing and getting us margaritas.    The food is OK.  I tried some garlic shrimp and a relleño on a previous visit.  Average food, above average for Mesa I suppose.     The service has been slow and unapologetic on both visits, so I'll have to pass on this place from now on."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying the food is good and I love the atmosphere.  But the service is slow.  My husband had the crab enchilada abs dais is the best seafood Mexican food he had eaten.  I got the pork Caritas plate.  Loved it.  We decided to try again two more times to see if the service was any better.  It was not.  Very very very slow."}
{"text":"Tired after a long ass ride from Ventura to Phoenix,  with a gorgeous detour up into Pine Cove, my stomach reminds me that I haven't eaten all day.   Since good vittle options are limited in this part of Mesa,  I bust out my trusty little Yelp app for a quick scan.   It's a coin toss between Mexican or Salvadorean. Much to my chagrin,  Mexican wins.  Not because I don't like it but because the idea of washing down a few pupusas with a nice cold beer was quite appealing and a welcome surprise given the sea of fast food and crappy chains which make up the culinary landscape around these here parts.   So off we went to nearby Casa Ramos. The place is cute and the service welcoming. The menu is your standard gringo-mex. The homemade salsa was devoured within seconds and the house margarita was decent. Rosario, our server,  was delightful.   All in all, this joint gets my seal of approval. Fin clapping begins here.   Good times in the Sonoran Desert!"}
{"text":"This was our second time coming here so I just had to hop on and right a review. This place is great, great ambiance, fun décor, and helpful staff. The food has not disappointed us one bit, the salsa is a little hot( but as a wimp with spicy foods that may not mean anything), great fajitas, and for the important stuff: amazing margaritas. We tried two margarita flavors so far, cactus pear and raspberry. While the raspberry was good the cactus pear was fantastic, and turned out to be a great flavor for a margarita. All in all this place seems to have great food and an even better décor so I would definitely recommend taking a look if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Usually on Yelp and similar sites, people either under-rate or overrate places. Well, I am here to tell you this place is worth every bit of the hype. I have NEVER had better Mole. The chicken mole enchiladas were like an orgasm in your mouth. I've been to Mexican restaurants all over the United States AND in Mexico and this is the hands down winner. The food is out of this world, the portions are huge, they have a large diverse menu, and the prices are great. Jessica was our waitress and she was OUTSTANDING!   Since we all know that everything can't be perfect, (although in this case, it really is), I will say there was one negative (in my opinion). I was not a big fan of the mariachi band (three guys singing and playing guitar) going around to each individual table and singing to you. To some people this may be great, but I'd prefer they just staying on a stage and sang at one point in the room instead of being a foot away while I'm eating. But even this didn't bar Casa Ramos from being my favorite Mexican place ever.  Sadly, I live in Nebraska so I eat here once a year if I am lucky. Therefore, PLEASE do my a favor and go savor the deliciousness of Casa Ramos for me!"}
{"text":"I ordered a bean burro and it came hot and delicious with a sort of crispy tortilla but not deep fried and I loved it!!! Chips and salsa were great! Would go back!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food I have had. Great decor and service as well!!!"}
{"text":"As always, Yelp is never wrong. A solid four stars for the pork carnitas and the wife says 4.5 for her shredded beef taco. The fried ice cream was different than expected with a decidedly unsweetened crust of cornmeal, not bad just not expected. It kind of grew on us by the end of the serving. Will return soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Don't let the outside of the place fool you. Lovely decor inside sets the tone for the fabulous food.  Yunique items not seen in other Mexican food restaurants in the valley.  Dessert is a must!"}
{"text":"This restaurant originated in Heber.  I spent lots of time up here as a teenager, and Heber brings back lots of good memories, so I liked this place before I ever set foot in the door, and when I did, oh my.    This place is fan freakin tastic.  Food was great, service was great,  there was even a mariachi band on Saturday night.    The amount of food you get, we both had another meal the next day.  We both got the taco, cheese enchilada and red burrito plate that comes with rice and beans.   Red chili meat was plentiful, very tender and tasty.  Taco had lots of tender juicy shredded beef.  But the best part of this plate was the cheese enchilada.  OMG it was good.  The enchilada sauce was definitely homemade.  I plan to go back to this place soon.   Rice and beans were good too.  Hot sauce was very spicy, and they had another option that wasn't as spicy too.  And we both got a soda.  Bill was under $27.    I'm serious, try it."}
{"text":"I really hate to give this place two stars, but our to-go order had so many mistakes and poor execution that I had to post. Pluses included tamale, flautas and sides. The server who helped us was great, but then I opened the food at home. Fajitas were wrong order( ordered double beef and got single beef/ chicken )and had lots of gristle/connective tissue. Most dishes were mushy due to lettuce next to/ under them and grease/ fat. Shrimp with chipotle was overwhelmingly spicy and strong with lots of grease. Ordered sopapillas which were missing. Perhaps things are better when you order in restaurant, but they really need to improve to-go quality and execution."}
{"text":"Lick-the-plate delicious!!!     We've been going once a week since we found this place a month or so ago....it's fabulous.  The atmosphere is very comfortable, the wait staff is friendly and attentive, and the food is amazing.    I had the Pollo a la Chipotle a couple weeks ago, and seriously considered licking the plate to get every last drop of sauce.  Last night I had the Camarones Rancheros, and again could not get enough of the fabulous sauce.  The meat in all the dishes is cooked perfectly, the chips and tortillas are freshly made, and the salsa is yummy!  We generally try whatever margarita they have on special, and so far I have not been disappointed....blood orange, purple cadillac, wild berry...YUM!  We'll definitely be continuing our weekly visits, and can't wait to share it with family when they come for a visit."}
{"text":"My wife and I grew up in Mesa and so we, like everybody else, ate Mexican food at the same few, well known restaurants, but now that we know about Casa Ramos, we really don't visit the old places much. From the chips and salsa (try asking for the green salsa), to every single different item we have tried on their menu we have been totally satisfied. Great food, great service, great prices."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years now and it is one of our families favorite Mexican restaurants. The prices are good the food is quality and the atmosphere is cool. This is in a rough part of Mesa, but we have never had any issues."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at Casa Ramos a half dozen times and have always had good food as well as service. My last visit I thought seafood might be nice and ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp ... TO DIE FOR!! The rest of the meal was good too but I'll be back for the shrimp for sure!"}
{"text":"Love the food!! It's awesome here idc if I don't get my drink in time I take it easy while I eat other than it being slow in service drinks and food is great!! It is a lovely place to eat quietly with the family. The green chile  with the chimichanga is the usual for me at this location along with a mango marg"}
{"text":"Great food, slightly expensive, but well worth the service and quality. Chips and Salsa were really good and the Carne Asada burrito was delicious."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting my Dad in Mesa and we ate here on a recommendation from friends.  The food was excellent and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place,  the food was great and service was wonderful. We would come back again but we live out of state."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we have gone here - still just as wonderful.  Had the grilled chicken tostada this time and HOLY CRAP it was the best chicken I have ever had!!!  This is def a hidden place where you will be suprised by the food quality and amount of food you get. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I am so so so disappointed to do this update.  To go from a restaurant where we enjoyed a 5 star meal, introduced friends and used it as the go to place for both dining in and take out - around 2 times PER WEEK to the terrible experience we had at lunch today.  My son said his chili relleno and enchilada combination plate was not nearly to the quality he has come to expect.  The Colorado burrito was a huge disappointment for the first time.  My 11 year old daughter (who is very very picky about Mexican food) ordered an a la carte burrito with rice, beans, cheese, lettuce, tomato and sour cream.  It came out as a huge burrito on a plate with rice and beans.  Only thing in the burrito was beans, cheese, lettuce and tomato.  This was cooked IN THE OVEN?!?!  The lettuce was the texture and consistency of spinach.  The sour cream was on the side.  Needless to say she hated all of it and wouldn't touch it or eat it.  My 9 year old daughter ordered taquitos (2) off the kids menu with guacamole and fries instead of rice and beans.  The taquitos (2) was actually a shredded beef and cheese chimichanga cut into 5 slices.  The guacamole was on top of the french fries.  The guacamole had chunks of jalapeno in it which made it to spicy for her to eat.  I had to try and scrape it off.  She also refused to eat it.  I was charged an extra $2.95 for the guacamole bringing the price of this kids meal (with no drink) to $7.95  I sent the a la carte burrito back.    Get the bill and have been charged $8.95 for the burrito plus $.75 cents for lettuce and $.99 for sour cream.  I told them I wasn't paying for it when she didn't get what she ordered and didn't like what she got.  The waiter argued with me and said he would take 50% off of the charge for that burrito.  I said I wasn't paying for it and that we were also not happy with the kids meal but wasn't complaining about it yet....  He left to talk to his manager and didn't come back for over 5 minutes.  At this point I was super close to just walking out and leaving an amount of cash on the table that I thought fair for the meal.  (My husband also had an enchilada plate.)   He brought the bill back with most of the burrito taken off except the $.99 for the side of sour cream.  I circled it in pink pen and wrote in capital letters TIP next to it.  Then left the $33.76 in cash on the table.  We will not return sadly enough.  Guess we have to find a new restaurant to frequent.  :("}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp I tried this place out. The foods amazing, our waiter was knowledgable and friendly. I'm referring this place to anyone looking for good quality Mexican food. And when you see there prices for the quantity of food they being you, you'll be in for a surprise!"}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp we just had the best Mexican food ever!  The service was great. The atmosphere was great! Could not have been any better!   Thanks fellow yelpers!!!!"}
{"text":"Better than any chain restaurant yet not great authentic Mexican food. I ordered the #18 which had an overly sweet chicken mole enchilada with hardly any flavor outside of the sugar. It also came with a really good chicken flauta not overly done with a nice cheese flavor inside, with good rice and beans. The fun interior adds to the atmosphere and the chips and salsas are yum. If you like a little heat ask for the green salsa, it is very good and homemade."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Casa Ramos.  We had excellent service and even better food. The menu is expansive with something everyone can enjoy. I had the tampenqueno con camarones??? No matter how you spell it, it was fantastic. The price is inexpensive and the serving sizes are huge. If you are looking for delicious Mexican food in Mesa than this is the place!"}
{"text":"This place was everything I ever wanted as far as mexican food goes. I ordered the mexican pizza, which was absolutely delicious!!! Salsa & chips were also great.  They had live mariachi. I have found a mexican restaurant that meets my expectations :)"}
{"text":"Finally we found a mexican restaurant worth going to. The salsa was outstanding and so was the food.  Service was quick but not rushed.  The best in all of Phoenix !!"}
{"text":"Salsa was old and fermented...made me sick to my stomach (seriously).  Lunch portions were very skimpy.  Food was nothing better than average.   Was very let down by this place.  How it gets such good reviews blows my mind."}
{"text":"It's refreshing when a place lives up to it's reputation and Casa Ramos is one of those places.  I found it via Yelp and I ended up visiting it twice during my short stay in Mesa.    I am vegetarian so on my first visit I had the Veggie Burrito lunch plate and it was delicious.  The mushrooms were excellent.  On my second visit I went with the Veggie Fajitas and, again, it was fantastic.  The sauce was perfect and the tortillas were fresh and really tasty."}
{"text":"We saw this place on Check Please! After eating here, \"check please\" was exactly what we wanted. The best part of the meal was the chips & salsa. We loved it & couldn't stop eating it. Very good & very flavorful. We started with margaritas. They turned out to be $8 worth of flavored ice water. I ordered the Especialidad de la Casa. The beef tasted bland & old BUT was tender. The shrimp was big & cooked properly. The chicken was dry, overcooked & the seasoning sat on top vs marinated as advertised. My wife ordered the steak & chicken fajitas. The steak again was old & flavorless. The seasoning sat on top of the chicken & was dry. All the meat tasted bland & stewed. Disappointed can't begin to describe how we felt. We drove all the way out there from Chandler. We passed much better restaurants to get to this one."}
{"text":"I visited this place with a group of co-workers after work looking for a good margarita.  This was definitely the correct choice!  I myself ordered the Premium margarita with Penasco tequila, no salt, and on the rocks, and let me say WOW!  What a great drink, they didn't skimp on the pour and didn't over do it with flavors.  It really hit the spot after a long day.  Although we only ordered a couple appetizers, the food seemed to taste ok for being a basic nacho plate and a large quesadilla."}
{"text":"We found our new favorite place for that Mexican food craving! I never write reviews but this place was so good that I just had to! The service was great, atmosphere relaxing and totally inviting and the food was absolutely perfect! The green chile pork....AMAZING!!! as well as the shredded beef that was in my chimichanga. I totally will be coming back and recommending to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with wife, my 92 year old Dad along with my dad's older friend and the gentleman's new wife. Gotta love those spry oldsters!  The server started us out with drinks and tortilla chips and bottles of salsa that was obviously house made. The chips were crisp but a bit odd in that they didn't have any salt but with the excellent, if rather mild, salsa they had plenty of flavor. Service was not fast but the wait for our meal was definitely worth it! Anyway the two ladies had to try the chile relleno's while I had the carne asada, Dad had a shredded beef taco and a pork enchilada and our friend had carnitas de puerco. All came with refried beans, mexican rice, a bit of shredded slaw and, in my case, guacamole. The rellenos were near perfect with a very large well roasted chili battered with a delicious very light batter and filled with a good Mexican cheese. The sauce was just right and had sufficient spiciness to be interesting without being overpowering for those who aren't crazy about hot. My asada was also very well prepared with the thin steak well charred and the corn tortillas of good quality. The beans and rice are very well made and are obviously an in house recipe.  I did not get a chance to taste either the pork carnitas or the taco-enchilada combo but the old gentlemen both averred that they were excellent dishes. My dad I know to be a very tough grader so his comments ensured that his dish was well prepared indeed!  Definitely the best Mexican restaurant I have found in Mesa and well worth a try."}
{"text":"I think I need to try this place again. My family and I stopped in for lunch one day. The chips and salsa were delicious, but my entree was so-so and my iced tea didn't taste right. The rest of my family enjoyed their dishes. Overall, it was ok. I wouldn't mind trying it again sometime."}
{"text":"After getting a sudden craving for cheese enchiladas and fried ice cream, I realized I didn't know about any good local places where I could get some. Thanks to Yelp, I found this AMAZING LITTLE GEM. The service is friendly and prompt, the food is *delicious*. The fried ice cream was so fresh and flavorful! A++, would eat again.   Seriously, this place is my new favorite Mexican spot."}
{"text":"Visited this based on the Yelp recommendations.  It did not disappoint!  Looks a little grotty from the outside, and seems typically tacky on the inside.  Good thing the food is crazy delicious.  Almost makes me wish I still lived in Mesa, just so I could visit weekly.  Instead I will have to plot my next visit and merely dream of taquitos."}
{"text":"We have been trying to find a good Mexican restaurant since we moved here almost two years ago. A friend told me about this restaurant and we decided to try it. The food is excellent. The margaritas are excellent. The service is excellent. This is now my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley.!!"}
{"text":"Food was not good and service was horrible , felt like I wasted money would of rather ate at del taco!"}
{"text":"Was there a week ago.  Very good food. The chipotle chicken is spectacular. I recommend although you'll have a food coma after lunch."}
{"text":"Three of us arrived for dinner at Casa Ramos in Mesa three days before Christmas. Altough staying in North Scottsdale 23 miles away the great reviews on Yelp inspired us to make the trip.  The building and decor is nothing out of the ordinary but the food is another matter. Our entree portions were plentiful and included a beef burrito, Camarones Al Mojo {a shrimp and mushroom dish with garlic butter sauce}, and Talpiquena, a very tasty carne asada beef with shrimp, garlic butter, mushrooms and cheese. All served with tortillas, and excellent rice and refried beans.  An extensive list of  beer and other beverages complete the package. Our server Marsha was very bubbly and attentive. Our next trip to the Valley of the Sun will include dinner at Casa Ramos."}
{"text":"What others have said - great service, great food, great atmosphere.  We went tonight and stuffed ourselves; the food was so good it was hard to stop. We will definitely be back. We loved the salsa too!"}
{"text":"I had tried Casa Ramos' salsas at a Yelp event a few years ago and meant to make it to the restaurant, but never did. Tonight (a Saturday), we finally made it there, arriving around 4:45PM. On a street where it seems like about half the restaurants are shut down, the parking lot was already starting to fill up at Casa Ramos. We were sat immediately and started with their complimentary chips and red salsa. We asked for some of their hot (green) salsa but they had run out. Nevertheless, some green salsa arrived at our table within 10 minutes.    I had the Carne Asada plate. The portion size was quite large and included skirt steak,  three tortillas (choice of flour or corn), guacamole, refried beans and rice. The meat was well-seasoned and absolutely delicious. The guacamole was fresh in the beans were also quite good. I don't really eat Mexican rice so I can't really comment on how good that was.  Overall, I highly recommend Casa Ramos and their carne asada.  Our service was solid and the value for the money is excellent. I will try to find my way back here as soon as possible when I'm on the side of town"}
{"text":"The plates here are huge, you get a whole lot of food for the money.  I tried the fajita enchiladas, and both the steak and chicken were quite good.  The marinade used on the meats is tasty.  The salsa was a little tame for my taste, but that is true of most places.  Overall I would not hesitate to try this place again.  They have a large menu, so there are lots of options for a future return visit."}
{"text":"LOVE this joint!  Our new favorite Mexican place, thanks to Yelpers!  Been there twice now in as many weeks, even took the kids.  I still can't get you out of my mind, Casa Ramos.  First of all, this MUST be a family joint because the service is incredible and you can tell they really care about pleasing you as a customer.   The chips are fresh and hot and they have a few different kick ass salsas.  Their 'house' salsa has the perfect amount of kick and chunk, they also offered us a milder sals for the wimpletons at the table, then they brought me the jalapeño habanero salsa.  All three were fresh and tasty as hell.  I bet you can't have just one bowl of chips.  I get the carne asada burrito with green extra spicy enchilada sauce.  The meat is super tender, perfectly grilled skirt steak.  It practically melts in your mouth and you can tell its a good quality cut of meat.  My wife gets the chicken and steak fajitas, which were aslo amazing.  To top it off, we had fried ice cream.  Definitely a hand made house recipe and also seemed fresher than any fried ice cream we'd ever had.  God I love this place.  So much so, I had to dust off my yelp account to let everyone know.  Go, now, don't hesitate.  Oh and great house margaritas!"}
{"text":"I've just moved here from San Diego & I've been searching for good Mexican food... Which I found in this place! Everything about it authentic & tastes like Mexico. The waitress was very nice & you could tell the waitstaff worked as a team being that numerous waitresses visited our table & would fulfill requests despite not being our primary waitress. The salsa was tasty & I loved the presentation. I got the enchiladas, which were tasty, & also had a coconut margarita that's not on the menu but was recommended by one of the waitresses & it was SO good! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pros:  good home made salsa, plenty of Chips, especial margarita, fun dido dip   Cons: service - had to ask for a drink, asked to order and get the check. Waitress acted as if we were a hassle.  Food turnaround time was extremely long. Plates came out super hot but the food was luke warm at best.   Overall:  still on a search for decent Mexican food in Phoenix. I do not recommend spending your hard earned money at this establishment.  I wish I would have picked up a burrito from a fast food joint instead."}
{"text":"We have lived by this place for about two years but hadn't tried it.  We've been very adventurous lately with trying new places so we decided to go for it.   The yelp reviews were mostly positive so we figured it couldn't be that bad.  We decided to do take out and ordered our food over the phone.  The person answering the phone was very polite and took the order without issue.  When we arrived to pick up the food the staff was incredibly polite which was great.  We received everything we ordered without any issues which seems to be a rare thing these days.  I had ordered the crab enchiladas since they advertised real crab meat.  The other items were carne asada and bean/cheese burritos.  The dinners had sides of beans/rice and we also had chips/salsa with our order.  The boxes were huge.  The food inside didn't come anywhere near filling the boxes.  There was nothing wrong with the portion sizes which were perfectly adequate.  They were just in boxes that weren't appropriately sized.    The first thing I did was try the chips/salsa.  The chips were good and I don't know if they make them or get them from someone else.  The salsa which is supposed to be house made had a major cumin overload.  I tried it a few times and then that was it.  I didn't want any more for the chips or my enchiladas.  I went and grabbed a bottle of Cholula out of my pantry.  I moved on to the crab enchiladas.  The sauce was okay but the crab meat tasted kind of fishy.  I couldn't tell if it was fake or if it was just old but either way it wasn't great.  It wasn't horrible but it definitely was not quality food worthy of the price.  The beans/rice were decent.  The carne asada and bean/cheese burritos were okay.    Other than the funky crab meat and the pure cumin salsa, the rest of the meal was just okay.  It wasn't bad and it wasn't overpriced.  It was just a \"meh\" type experience.  Given the choice, I would gladly go around the corner and go to Garcia's.  It's not the best Mexican food experience either but definitely a better quality and much more enjoyable than this place."}
{"text":"I usually can find something wrong in a restaurant, and maybe I will after a couple of visits here, but so far, I love this place.  My husband is a OTR driver so when he comes home, I will yelp out as many new places as possible.  Since we recently moved to the east side, and were lacking a Mexican restaurant, this became the last search.  Casa Ramos was found, and I remembered why chain restaurants were so under rated.    We came in to a near empty restaurant about 6:00 pm on a Tuesday.  Immediately, I got scared.  However, we were greeted right away and after a quick photo opt with the cut-out cardboard (cheesy but way fun) we were seated in a booth. Chips and salsa were served within a couple of minutes and our drink orders were taken.  Salsa was great, chips were warm (maybe not super fresh, but not mediocre or stale either...I would just say, not made in house). I ordered my \"first time\" Mexican dish...a tamale.  This to me is a true testimony if I will love a place or not.  My husband order a taco, enchilada plate (I order a flauta and taco also). The food came out and was fantastic.  Meat was juicy and seasoned great.  My tamale came out almost perfect (good masa to meat portion, not killed over by sauce and cheese).  Everything tasted phenomenal.   Rice and beans were good too (I'm not really a bean person, but I still ate a few bites).  The service was attentive and cordial.  I really have no complaints.  I'll probably go on the weekend, just to test out service, but I can't wait for this gem to be our new favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Really liked this place.  The chips and salsa were delicious.  I had the enchilada suiza with green sauce which was delicious.  The atmosphere is both fun and attractive and our waiter was excellent.  Nothing not to like here."}
{"text":"Super cheap and good food.  Service is decent - kind of slow sometimes."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant my husband and I have been to in AZ. They have the best food and the nicest employee we've ever met. Seriously the best place! Highly recommend this restaurant. I get a shrimp dish almost always and my hubby loves their steak tacos."}
{"text":"Well, it took a couple of years, but I found the BEST Mexican food in the Phoenix area (I know, bold statement) thanks to fellow yelpers!  The food, decor, wait staff & value were second to none.  The chips and salsa were fresh and delicious.  For dinner, I got the steak a la chipotle, and Angie got the chicken a la crema.  Both come with fresh tortillas on the side, and the servings were huge.  Mexican rice, refried beans & small portion of fresh cabbage were incredible.  They also both came with fresh, sauteed mushrooms which went perfectly with both dishes.  The only negative I can offer (which was difficult, 'cause almost everything else was perfect) was the fluorescent lighting - no one wants to be reminded of \"work\" when they're trying to unwind with a nice meal - and the lighting reminded me of that.  Outside of the minor lighting snafu, I have nothing negative to say about this place.  We will be back, soon!"}
{"text":"I was really looking for a strong margarita and didn't find it here. The first sip was, but that was all..  The food is rather generic. Nothing really stood out to me here. The service was very slow, had to wave someone down to get another drink.  It's typical Mexican fare. No real authentic flare outside if the Mexican music blaring.  Won't be back. It wasn't terrible, it just didn't stand out as anything to come back for."}
{"text":"Normally we go to the location in Heber Arizona. And we always are happy there. Tried this location and it wasn't to what we had come to love about the Heber location. Food was OK. Service was terrible and there wasn't anyone else there not sure if we got them on a off night or what happened."}
{"text":"Really solid food, reasonable prices.  Will definitely be back again, glad to find this place.  Thanks yelp for recommending!!"}
{"text":"Mmmm! The super burrito is delicious. Big portions. The waiter for a few things wrong, like I asked for my burrito to not be enchilada style and it came out enchilada style. Not a big deal. Plus there isn't an extra charge for guac. Love guac!"}
{"text":"I had gotten a Groupon because we were going to be in the area but didn't know anything about Casa Ramos.   It was a good choice.  The food was excellent, the portions are so big they are on a plate that almost doesn't fit on the table.  Our waiter, Juan, was very knowledge at suggesting items on the menu, drinks, etc.  He came back to the table often sometimes just to visit with us.  He made us feel very welcome.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere! The decorations are great! The food was good. The endless hot chips and salsa was great! The live music was very relaxing, almost like a vacation! Definitely one of the diamonds in the rough.  The only thing that was not so great is the service. The server wasn't very attentive, and we had to call for a round of refills.  I wouldn't call it bad, but slow. It's a good Mexican place! I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for good Mexican food. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was Super Slow. Took awhile to get chips and salsa. Then had to ask for water. Took a long time to get our order in. Then we had to start to walk towards cashier to get our check. Hope you have better luck."}
{"text":"It's good.  Huge portions though, order one meal and you can get two maybe three meals out of it.  I like that they have veggie options on the menu.  Iced tea tasted funny and salsa taste like taco sauce but those are the only drawbacks i found.  Wait staff all seemed very friendly and someone was always asking about refills and making sure we didn't need anything."}
{"text":"This place is as generic as it gets. I could've made a better dinner with products from Walmart."}
{"text":"It took over half an hour for our food to come out and when we got it, it was soggy and not very hot so it had obviously been sitting for a while....In addition the order wasn't even right!! The only good thing was that the beer was cold! This was our 1st time here but we definitely won't be back!"}
{"text":"Always ask a local for a recommendation. Excellent food, atmosphere and servers. Next time I will order the pork carnitas."}
{"text":"You can't find any better authentic Mexican food in mesa and the service is superb and friendly"}
{"text":"Me and my family visited this location, and I think the only word that fits this place is great!I I believe we went there on Valentine's Day and they had mariachis and the food was amazing plus our waiter Juan set our experience over-the-top. I would really enjoy if they kept the mariachis on the weekends. We will be returning, see you soon the Clark family!"}
{"text":"My experience was not a pleasent one. Location - plenty of parking Atmosphere- a little cramped, but efficient use of space in number of tables. Went early lunch 11:30 no one else there (customers) Service- took awhile to be attended, only one person. He was busy doing something else. Upon ordering some enchiladas the gentleman proceeds to tell me that there are no tortillas.  I personally was in shock to here this, since it is a mexican restaurant and tortillas are a staple ingridient to the cuisine. After waiting for 15 min to receive my food. The gentleman sais that they found some. And after another 15 min get my food. Food-it was ok. Nothing great to talk about."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, prices were excellent & portions were worth my  buck.  The margarita was price for as much as I got. All-around I was very satisfied with the food."}
{"text":"Went with my family of 4 and my grandparents. Didn't have to wait for a table or chips and salsa but it took forever for a server to come to our table. Once we ordered drinks it was another 10 minutes before she brought them to us (not busy either, only a few tables were sat).   I ordered a prickly pear frozen margarita, it tasted like pink lemonade, not prickly pear, it was very light, almost white and had hardly any flavor.   We waited an hour for our food. She came back to our table numerous times to tell us it would be out in a minute and it never was. Finally the food came, I ordered a taco salad, the shell was completely soggy and again not much flavor. My grandmother also ordered the taco salad and asked for ranch. She said that the ranch tasted like mayonnaise and told the server and said \"that's strange\" and walked away. My 2 year old just wanted fries, fries didn't come. When I asked about it she told me that she forgot to put them on the tray. Waited another 10 minutes for the fries, when she dropped them off they were all cold.   Really bummed about this place, I live in Ohio and have heard that the Mexican food around town is amazing. Unfortunately based on this experience the Mexican food in Ohio is way better!"}
{"text":"I a born in Mesa gal and know good Mexican food when I taste it.  I read all the reviews and decided to try this place.  The restaurant is on Main, between Stapley and Gilbert in the old \"Golden Fork\" building.  The interior is Mex Style with faux adobe, artwork and the like.  We were seated promptly for lunch and immediately brought chips and salsa.  Both were good.  Our server promptly took our order. We both had Lunch Special \"2\" which is a taco+enchilada served with beans and rice.  Plates were super hot, beans were good, rice was good but it ended for me there.  The cheese enchilada was bland and the taco meat too \"Fake\" tasting.  It had that taco seasoning flavor.  I was genuinely underwhelmed by the place.  It wasn't bad, wasn't good.  The carpet in the restaurant is filthy and must be replaced (this time put in tile) I found the carpet a that a little off putting.  $6.50 for a lunch special which is good.  Like I said,  the food was serviceable but certainly not in any way memorable.  They do have happy hour -- $3 house margaritas and 2 for 1 beer.  I might go back someday for that but I would never go again for the food.  The Filibertos next door has better food (and a drive through)  :-)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service from a longtime Mesa eatery.  Bonus was the Mole Chicken.  Luv luv luv me some Mole."}
{"text":"So good!  We went on Mother's Day and the place was packed, but we only waited about 6-8 minutes and the hostess was very apologetic.  The food was wonderful - i got Green Chile Pork Enchiladas and by husband branched out and ordered the Crab Enchiladas which were sweet and savory and so delish.  We well definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"A good quality, authentic Mexican restaurant. Try the Chile Relleno, it's excellent!"}
{"text":"Casa Ramos is a Mexican restaurant that replaced El Galeon a few years back. The interior is kind of cool, with lots of wood and nice ambience.  Most if the time, it's pretty empty.  They usually seat all the white people in the same area, which kills me. Snowbirds and endless banter are two of my least favorite things. Add some screaming kids, and I probably wouldn't ever come back. Unlike some of the reviews here, I have never been forgotten or had to wait for refills, etc. On the contrary, I was probably asked a million times if I wanted more chips, more drinks, etc.   Everything here has turned very caucasian. Coming from a caucasian,  well...There used to be large Mexican families and lots going on. Now there are a few old ladies who talk about birdbaths and medical problems over quesadillas (with two Ls, not an ll).  The chips are not warm, and the salsa is uber mild. The iced tea and horchata are good. They now serve Pepsi products, so...yuck.  My go-to meal is the seafood chimichanga. I'm not one for chimis, but this one is filled with fish, shrimp,  crab and octopus, with a fantastic seafood rue over top that frankly, I could drink from a cup.  I think that Mexican food is different for different people. So, give it a try and make your own judgement. If there wasn't the seafood chimi, I may not go there,  so I can't testify to other dishes."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican Restaurants I have been to!! LOVE this place! Relaxing, wonderful, authentic atmosphere! Family run, and very friendly! Last, but certainly not least, the food is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"First of all, the rave reviews were accurate.  I brought my wife, my 3yr old son and my 94yr old grandmother to this place because we were looking for the best Mexican food in town.  I used Yelp to find this gem since I don't know the area very well.  It was hard to believe that a restaurant can maintain a 5 star rating, but now I see why.  Everyone was so accommodating.  The hostess seated us in a nice quiet booth so we could have a nice conversation.  She also offered to track down some crayons and sheets of paper for my son because they didn't have a kids coloring menu.    The waitstaff were also extremely accommodating.  They were prompt with their service, but were also available to answer questions (which they had knowledgable answers).  The food was amazing and reasonable.  Everything is fresh and homemade.  Yes, the salsa is good, and the entrees were large and tasty, but what really made the experience special was the fried ice cream the size of my 3yr old's head.  I am not usually a fried ice cream guy, but somehow I made room.  The restaurant was very clean and pleasant.  I saw some reviews stating that the neighborhood looked sketchy, but I felt completely safe.  The parking lot was well lit and there were people coming and going regularly.  There was nothing rough about it.  I would gladly bring my family back.    Thanks for the experience Casa Ramos!"}
{"text":"I'm on a mission to try new restaurants around my new home... I'm sure glad I stopped in at Casa Ramos and got to try something that isn't listed on their menu... a chili Verde burrito... ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!  Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The service was the best part of this restaurant. The food was nothing special but the restaurant is clean, uniquely designed, and the service was great. I don't believe I will be back because of the food quality."}
{"text":"First trip here. Service was great and the food was some of the best Mexican I have had. This is my new favorite Mexican place."}
{"text":"The servers there Kenny, Joe, bus-young man David, are excellent, efficient , knowledge about the flavors etc on menu.  We (3) had the enchilada plate, #10 plate, and tostado plate, each plate was 2 meals in one.  The flavors are very mild, so I could enjoy the flavor, and NOT the spice, it was EXCELLENT! We go after church, extra hungry, so we are really are very happy to get it the food hot and FAST! The restaurant itself is clean and open. You can NOT beat the price there and the food is INCREDIBLE!  Good menu selection.   Great portions.   This will be \"OUR\" to go place on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place!! The super burrito is my favorite and the chips and salsa are delicious!"}
{"text":"This is our to go place for yummy Mexican food. Never disappointed... margaritas are good too"}
{"text":"Very disorganized poor poor service food was burnt hopefully for their sake this was a rare bad night. I will not take another chance with my hard earned money"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, kind service, flavorful food - definitely a repeat visit! The white sauce is delicious."}
{"text":"Finally, good Mexican food in Mesa! I just moved to Mesa from Glendale, and let me tell you, the West side wins the Mexican food wars. Anyway, I had a combo plate with a green chile \"burrito\" (it was more like an enchilada with a flour tortilla instead of corn, which was a little disappointing) and a cheese enchilada. The rice was nothing special but everything else, including the beans, was excellent. The green chile was pretty spicy and sooo good. Enchilada and sauce were perfect. Beans were great. My companion had a combo plate with a green chile chimi, chalupa and taco. He said everything was delicious. Chips and salsa were great. Prices were about average for a sit down Mexican place. Oh, and they never let us run out of water, something that is very important to my expectations. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Crappy food and even worse service. I'm getting tired of yelp foodies steering me wrong. HEED MY WARNING, I sacrificed my time and money so you do not have to!!"}
{"text":"Great  food.    The initial impression of the building sets the expectations low as does the average decor of the restaurant.  However, the first taste of the homemade salsa told me this could be a great meal- and it was.    The pork carnitas were amazing as were all of the trimmings.  The tamales were a little thicker than they needed to be but the owner's personable son, tending bar, assured me they are working on bringing those up to par with the rest of the food.    Highly recommend this place if you want some great Mexican food."}
{"text":"After reading Yelp reviews we choose Casa Ramos for our Mexican meal.  Curb appeal is OK, and once inside you are treated to a big room and full bar.  Staff quickly sat us, took our drink order and then our dinner order.  Food was sizzling hot when it arrived.  I had the beef and chicken fajitas.  They were excellent and plenty of food on the plate.  My wife had the chile relleno and was happy with her meal as well.  The staff was very friendly and on task.  Both the waitress and server checked more that once to see that our needs were met.  We both agreed we would eat there again.  BOB from COBB Cobb, CA"}
{"text":"Wow.  I'd go back just for the salsa (since that was the first thing served, along with nice house-made chips).  The depth/variety of flavors in the salsa showed me what is actually possible in what has become more of a throwaway in most Mexican restaurants.  I can attest to the fact that the rest of the meal continued at a very high level.  We enjoyed one of the meals for two, which included skirt steak, chicken, shrimp, mushrooms as well as some chiles and scallions.  This was accompanied by rice and beans which were very flavorful, again not just the standard accompaniments as in most eateries.  Great flavors, perfectly prepared and presented.  Oh, and I should mention that the service was excellent.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place a hundred times, my husband and I finally made it in today for lunch. Our meal started with a generous helping of chips and salsa. My husband ordered the Mexican pizza and I the chicken tostada platter. We both liked his dish a little better but none the less they were both good. I'm only giving it 3 stars because I didn't feel like the food was super out of the ordinary and this will be a good back up if we don't make it to our usual go to Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Casa Ramos was a last minute change of plans. Upon walking in the place was Hot temperature wise, and uncomfortable.  The service was not great and not bad. They were quick to get our drinks and chips, but then took forever to come snd take our order. This was surprising since there wasn't too many people in the restaurant. I ordered the lunch special combo which comes with an Enchilada ,burrito, rice and beans. The burritos and Enchiladas were a solid 3 of 5 stars.  Not great but not bad. So hot restaurant , 2 stars, ok food 3 stars, and ok service. Just an ok rating in my book. One positive was the lemonade, it was really good"}
{"text":"I was in Mesa for business and wanted some good Mexican. My hotel sent me to a different Mexican restaurant but when I got there they said they were closing. I jumped on Yelp and drove to Casa Ramos and I am glad that I did. Their chips and salsa were great. I ordered the Colorado burrito and the meat was tender and the sauce was perfect. I look forward to returning and trying other things on the menu."}
{"text":"The food is great and the chili Colorado is to die for. Best beans I've had out here in Arizona by far. We eat here everytime we're in the area nothing else compares."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment with my family on 12/5/15.  This was our first time coming here, and I could not be more pleased.  The hostess was pleasant, the wait staff was efficient, polite, and friendly.  Our head waiter Juan was engaging and assisted with any questions we had.  He was also very good with my son.  I ordered off the combination plates: pick 3.  You can pick ANY 3 items from the entire combination numbers.  I chose a chicken taco, chicken chimi, and a cheese enchilada.  The platter comes with rice and refried bean, but you can order vegetarian beans/no cholesterol beans instead.  The other adult chose 3 item combo too and decided on: chicken chimi, cheese enchilada, and chili relleno.  My son got a children's plate: beef taco with rice and beans.  The meal came out pippin' hot, looked fresh, and was a large portion.  The vegetarian beans were incredible!!  It was almost like a soup.  All of us were not able to finish our meals, and shared a fried ice cream.  The major different to their fried ice cream was instead of individual corn flakes on the ice cream, the flakes were grounded up.  The edible bowl was cinnamon delicious.  I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"This place is great! A surprise spot in my neck of the woods I was unaware of. I'm a native to the east valley, so having Mexican food I can enjoy outside of my extended family's cooking is difficult. I can't give it 5 stars because the service didn't blow my socks off, but the food is outstanding. You have to ask for their hot green sauce, it will burn you. :)"}
{"text":"I have a new favorite Mexican joint! My usual affordable neighborhood place is closed for the summer, we had guests in from the east coast who wanted Mexican , I used yelp to find this place and I literally want to eat there again and I'm still full from the gigantic portion I just ate! I was happy with the staff ( take out) and the food. We arrived early to pick up our order and I noticed that when a party walks in the staff goes immediately to get their chips while the hostess is seating them, now that's service. I have 0 complaints about the food nothing we had was iffy or eh and our guests were impressed"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and attentive and chips and salsa when we sat down were good, but the rest of the food was not very good.  The meat in my shredded beef taco tasted like it had gone bad.  My tamale needed firmer masa and more flavor, and the red sauce covering it was so bland and tasted like the last can of Rosarita enchilada sauce I regretted cooking with.  Rice and beans both lacked flavor.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to get some good Mexican food! We've been a couple times and have always left full with a good box of leftovers for lunch the next day :) I love the steak fajitas! For how good the food is I'm surprised we've never had to wait for a table! The service is hit or miss, on weekends they usually are pretty on top of things but we have gone a couple times where the service was very slow... But honestly it's still worth it! Just make sure your not in a hurry :)"}
{"text":"We've been a few times because the food is good, but the service is normally pretty slow. More than once we've had to ask for a check or remind someone that we're ready to order."}
{"text":"Great Carne asada, roasted onion, roasted Jalapeño. Whole pinto beans instead of refried nice touch. I gotta come here more often."}
{"text":"Awesome! Clean as a pin, the decor is wonderful and the food, oh the food!  Everything was excellent but the red chile beef was out of this world!  The chips and salsa are warm and fresh but I preferred the 'Hot' salsa.  The portions are huge and the price is very reasonable, its a keeper!"}
{"text":"Read the other YELP reviews & saw they were open on Sundays, so we headed right over to satisfy our craving for Mexican food.  Better than the reviews said!  The chips arrive warm & the salsa is great, not so spicy that all you taste is the heat.  Our server was friendly & the food was amazing.  We are already planning what to order \"next time\"!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were good - service was good. Once our order was taken, it took a considerable amount of time for our food to come out. At first, I almost became upset - but the food was well worth the wait! Someone in my party ordered the steak fajitas and the hot plate sizzled for a good 5-7 minutes at the table. Portions were large and the food was authentic. Will gladly eat there again!"}
{"text":"Super fast and friendly service! And GREAT food! They came by a couple times to ask if everything was good and the food was out in less than 20 minutes.  This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant for sure!"}
{"text":"**I wish I could use a 1/2...this would be 3 1/2 STARS** I was looking for a new place to try on a Sunday night.  I read the reviews here on Yelp first, then watched the \"Check Please\" episode.   I was dining alone, so I asked the hostess if I could sit in the bar area for dinner.  I was told there was no bartender, but the waitress would serve me there.  I was afraid I would be forgotten if I was seated there and there was no dedicated server for the bar area, so I opted for the dining room. The dining room was about half full; I was seated in a booth and waited about 8 to 10 minutes before a young man came by to bring chips and salsa and asked if I wanted something to drink.  I asked for a margarita on the rocks and a glass of water.  He came back shortly after to confirm I said frozen margarita.  No, on the rocks, please.  The waitress came by shortly after to tell me my drink was on it's way.  A frozen margarita arrived (??) I flagged down another server to correct the problem. Ok, now for the food!  The chips were fantastic!  My favorite style; crisp, not too thick and full of flavor.  The salsa they bring is good, but I asked for a hotter salsa too.  It was a small bowl of green chili heaven.  I ordered a small serving of guacamole to go with the chips.  It was quite tasty too, chunky and well seasoned, but a little over priced. For my dinner, I ordered the Talpiquena (Carne Asada with Shrimp).  It was very good; the meat was tender and the shrimp were tender and delicious as well.  The refried beans were out of this world wonderful...I am generally not so enthusiastic about refried beans, but these warrant the praise!  The flour tortillas included with meal tasted like good homemade tortillas; though they are not house made,   The service was the only thing that was lacking in this restaurant. It was inattentive and a bit aloof.  I assumed that it was because I was a woman dining alone, as nearly all the other tables didn't seem to be lacking attention.  Toward the end of my meal, my waitress did get friendlier and did bring another tortilla when I asked for it to include with my leftovers. I will come back to try other dishes (the green chili pork is on my list to try); hopefully the service will be as good as the food next time."}
{"text":"Good food, above average but horrible service. The hostess couldn't memorize the specials for the day and didn't bother to ask and let us know. I enjoyed the fresh salsa and warm chips, dashed a bit of salt and munched alongside our drinks."}
{"text":"Casa Ramos is amazing!  The best mexican restuarant I have been to in the valley and I have been to a lot!  Their service is superb, food is great, and the value is the best!  Would highly reccomend to anyone looking for the best bang for their buck!  Also, if you are ever in the Heber area, check them out up there too!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! We highly recommend. We got a #20 enchilada/taco combo plate and steak fajitas."}
{"text":"Juan is a humble celebrity server. Everyone seems to know him and if you ask for him he will bring forth free hot chips and homemade salsa. The food was hot and the servings generous. We thought the service was quick and attentive. This was our first time eating at Casa Ramos in Mesa. We eagerly await its reopening once construction of the light rail is completed. Dinner was a five-star experience for us."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. It was a Mother's Day treat for me with my 2 boys. What a treat. From the out side ur kinda , I don't know. But the inside is inviting , with a warm feeling and the food is so....... Good.  This is a gem in the rough.  I would recommend this.  Food and atmosphere great. I posted pictures also. Good mexican food. Thank you my boys!! :)"}
{"text":"I visit Mesa AZ two or three times a year.  My sister and her family take me to Mexican restaurants all over the valley...this is my favorite.  Great service.  Wonderful chips and salsa.  We all love the entrees...faitas...tacos etc.  Good margaritas.  This is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I'll say the usual \"if there was a Zero rating, I give this place a zero rating\". This place has to be top 2 of the worst Mexican restaurants I have ever eaten. Prior to coming here, I read the reviews from Yelp and Google and overall it rated fairly well. So we decided to try it. Walking in looked fine and there were two large parties sitting and a few small tables. We were taken to a booth, looked over the menu, patiently waiting for someone to take our drink. 10 minutes go without a server acknowledging us. My observation was the servers were catering to the large \"non-minority\" parties, filling drinks, and clearing plates. I finally had to flag down the hostess to take our drinks and politely said we were needed our order in. She took our order saying \"I see your server back there but I'll take your order for him\" (FYI we never met our intended waiter during the meal). We had for two - number 3 (shredded beef tacos) and a GREEN chili chicken enchilada on the side. 40 minutes go by, no food, bus server is the one who only fills drink when we have to put our empty glasses at the edge of the table (average refill time is 5-10 min). I should mention that during our wait for our order, one of the two larger tables had their food and the other table food order was in progress of cooking.   After 40 minute wait, we finally received our food. Skeptic as we were, we touched our food to see if it was warm which is was. We took bite out of tacos. It took a lot to swallow a hard, graham cracker shell with non seasoned roast beef and packaged cheese. Then we took a small bite out of enchilada. Although we ordered a GREEN one, we got a RED one. At this point we thought oh well just eat it. First and only bite from that so called authentic sauce was \"I can tasted the aluminum from this canned store bought enchilada sauce\". Here is where my boyfriend and I decided \"no more, we aren't paying for this gross food, only the drinks.\" We flagged down the hostess and told her we aren't eating and just want the check for our drinks. Again we wait.  Finally I assumed the manager comes to us, asking what is wrong with the food. I told her 1 - service is slow 2 - taco shells tasted like they were baked not fried and no salt 3 - our order was wrong and enchilada sauce was clearly store bought. 4 - beans said awful and the cheese was not the mix or blended I would expect from an \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant.  She defended the quality of food. Her tone was non concerning and felt like she didn't care. She said she would change our bill.   Another 5-10 minutes go by until we get our new bill of $2.43 (one Pepsi with tax).   I should note that all the minority tables took longer to service than the causation tables. I felt bad for this table of 3. They had waited 50 min for their food and didn't complain nor received an apology. Also during this time, a family of 5 were seated next to the table of 3 and because all the servers focused their attention on the big tables, they ended up walking out. No one came up to them nor apologized which I informed the manager of this mistreatment.  Never again will we come here. I feel bad for the small tables. I guess the restaurant is more concerned for the 18% gratitude from large parties than providing customer service to all their customers.  The worst part was the food. People who wrote good reviews, what is wrong with you! Their food is disgusting. How can you call this quality food?  I do have to say thank to you Casa Roma. \"Thank you making me appreciate Commodores Guadalajara restaurant even more. If we didn't experience the crap service you provided and disgusting canned food you served us, we would have taken for granted the excellent food and service we get EVERY visit at Commodores.\"  I will gladly continue to drive to Commodores (7th ave and I-17) to eat quality food and excellent customer."}
{"text":"Saw CR II on Check Please, Arizona yesterday and liked what I saw, so we checked it out last night. They were out of horchata and flan, apparently a run on the latter due to being showcased on the show earlier in the day. I had combo fajitas (steak + chicken), while zombie girl had a fajitas choice that included fish, shrimp, and scallops. Both were excellent. Tried the Cheese Crispy appetizer, it was just OK - a bit on the greasy side. Chips and accompanying salsa both excellent. Prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food, service was great, the place is clean and clearly well-run. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came here after seeing it featured on check please.  The food was good. I had the pork carnitas and they had good flavor. The service on the other hand wasn't the greatest. Thankfully the bus boy took our order and took care of us more than our actual server. I would go back, it was good."}
{"text":"Went for the first (and last time) on Friday for lunch at 2pm.  There were 4 of us. There was one other table of 4. In the entire restaurant. We waited forever for drinks, a server, our food and our bill. The food was OKAY but not worth waiting over an hour.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"Loved every bite. 5 stars all day long! I have been to the one in Heber, but this one is even better!   Even the beans were good, could be a meal on their own."}
{"text":"So my girlfriend and I were on our way to have some Indian food when I found this Mexican Restaurant with a five star rating on Yelp. We thought we had to give it a try and I am really glad we did.  I was at first worried about the location but when you walk in it was nothing like I expected. What a great decor this place had. It was open, colorful, and comfortable. The service was great  and the staff was friendly.  I am not a Mexican food specialist and can't tell you what authentic is but I can tell you what taste good and  this place had it all from warm chips and a fresh pint of salsa, rice and beans to kill for, a flavorful red sauce, and just delicious food.   We will for sure be regulars here and have already passed the word to friends who have enjoyed this restaurant as much as us."}
{"text":"Very good food, family owned, friendly staff. One of our favorite restaurants in the east  valley."}
{"text":"The outside of the restraunt was nasty. Once you got inside, the decor was good and the music was great. Fresh warm chips and salsa, wasn't hot but good. I had pork carnitas. They were pretty good, shredded pork with a green salsa some warm tortillas(not homemade) rice(fluffy) and refried beans (nice flavor). Service was great! There is also a full bar.
