{"text":"They definitely missed the mark. I ordered a \"meat lover's\" pizza via their online ordering application, which they refer to as \"King Nicks Feast\". On the ordering screen, I saw all of the listed ingredients for the pizza and I chose to add feta cheese. I was given a 45 minute delivery estimate. An hour and a half later, I received a cold, cheese pizza (with feta). The receipt that they brought clearly indicated \"King Nicks Feast\", so I'm a bit lost as to how you leave all the meat off of a meat lover's pizza. To be fair, the cold cheese pizza was at no charge. The gentleman I spoke to on the phone indicated that they were a little overwhelmed, due to the Steelers game, and that the driver had mistakenly missed our home on his route. However, if things were really that out of hand, I would have appreciated some notification so that I could have made other plans (PB&J for everyone!).  I can't really comment on the quality of their product, given that my order was missing most of its ingredients and was cold. All I can say is that it seems they have a few wrinkles to iron out (you might want to add a note to remember the meat, if you order online) and that I don't think I'll be back to check on their progress."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a pizza place like this for a while. Nice large slices of thin New York style pizza.  The toppings and cheese were very good and the leftovers were awesome re-heated the next day. This will be our go-to pizza place in Wexford!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the North Hills pizza selection!  Brought the recipes from the previous shop on Mt. Washington. Family owned. All homemade and a great menu!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend raved about the subs so we finally went there together today. Big mistake. The sub had a strange smell, taste, and texture and after two bites or so, I decided to inspect the meat further and it also had an \"off\" color. I stopped eating, as it definitely seemed to be old or bad meat. My boyfriend insisted his was fine, ate it, and is now sick leading into the holiday weekend. They also don't have a fryer but sell a lot of typically fried foods - they just cook them in the oven.  The fries were essentially ore ida fries cooked in a pizza oven. This was my first and last experience."}
{"text":"We bought and used a Groupon type thing and tried Bellissimos for the first time. When all 3 of us took a bite of the pizza, we all said how delicious it was. The sauce, the cheese and the dough were all great. My son commented, we should go back every week when they have pizza on special. We also had a chicken salad and it was very fresh and very good. We'll definitely go back and highly recommend. One more thing, they have a nice dining area as well."}
{"text":"Horrible..  A very dirty place and not up to par with the times.   Cooks don't use gloves   At least the one who looks like he's on work release doesn't .  Italian oven pizza much much better at McKnight intersection. Avoid this dive"}
{"text":"We stopped in to take a large cheese pizza home and found that three people could eat the pizza with no problem. Super thin New York style that can be folded in half. It was a good pizza and would try it again.  I am taking off one star because the customer service was a non-existent. The people who seem to either own or visit there often stood in and around the kitchen talking without engaging anybody who walked in the restaurant. Not that we wanted to be best friends but it felt a bit cold.  So my advice skip the dinning experience and go for takeout. Note we only had the cheese pizza so we can not commit about the other food items."}
{"text":"This pizza was alright. The slices were massive like some Saturday night fever John travolta New York City pizza but all the toppings went to the middle of the pizza and there was a lot of crust action going on. Sauce had a strange taste...cheese blend was pretty good. Crust was very chewy it made my jaw hurt. Would MAYBE go again for a sub but no thanks on the pizza."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. My experience was mediocre. It was one of those, 'Well, I don't exactly regret eating here, but I can't think of a single reason I'd ever come back' places.   I had a Traditional Italian sub and it was okay. I mostly tasted the bread. The sub was no better than Jersey Mike's, who's Italian sub is awesome.   I also had a slice of pepperoni, which again was completely mediocre. It was a small step up from a frozen Tony's, but a large step down from a good pie.  I'm not one to care much about decor, but this place looks like every restaurant on \"Restaurant Impossible\" where Chef Irvine stops in the entrance, looks annoyed and later takes a sledge hammer to something while yelling at his designer and builder to perform a miracle. I would sum up the decor as, \"Got everything out of a dumpster behind a remodeled diner and a big TV\".   The best part about my meal was the bottle of Coke and the ranch Doritos.   If you're close and need to grab a quick meal, you won't want to light your face on fire after eating here or anything. However, if you have time, you'd be better served going elsewhere for something really good.   Seeing the other reviews, it's possible I just had a bad meal. More likely those reviewers know the owner. I always get suspicious when someone compliments the chef and owner. Just my $.02."}
