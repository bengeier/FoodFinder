{"text":"Explosion of flavor, Service was perfect,  Glad someone had foresight to save the cool old beefeaters building, the food and atmosphere was a welcome change. As you can tell I am not handing out reviews at all but \"just had to\" after my visit."}
{"text":"We tried the Sunday brunch. There was a great selection including specialty cocktails. Everything was delicious. I look forward to going back for dinner. The service was also spot on."}
{"text":"All I can say IS DREADFUL!  Strange presentation,nothing made sense!  Sour,dry,unappealing food.  Go to Chelsea's Kitchen for AMAZING food,served well in a wonderful setting!   I'll never trust, Check Please, again!!!"}
{"text":"A few friends and I went here for restaurant week and were very satisfied! It was a very nice atmosphere and the food was awesome. My friend and I both got different meals and split everything so as to get to try a bit more, which was a perfect route to go. The duck confit was amazing! It came with collard greens which were on point but the risotto beneath was a little odd. The other entree was the shrimp and grits. Another great choice! It was a little spicy so paired with the sweet grits it was to die for.   The only disappointment was the dessert... I should have just strayed from the restaurant week menu to get some beignets, but I'm sure I will return some time in the future to satisfy those cravings! I would definitely recommend going here and am sure I will go back. Louisiana style food which I'm not used too, but very, very good!"}
{"text":"Great food and Chris was awesome.  Fried green tomatoes were delicious.  Blackened catfish and gumbo were really good.  We ordered a variety of sides and all were great.  Also found out they can accommodate a vegan so we will be back."}
{"text":"Big disappointment, having spent most of my life in the South, eating Southern food, this was not it !   The portions compared to price was bad. Southern folks don't fool ya, they feed you.   The flavor for red beans and rice was great, but again $17.00 for a cup of beans over a cup of rice in a large bowl is not what Momma would have done. No side either, not even a cornbread muffin.  The $18.00 Gumbo  with \"Anduille\" sausage hugh!??? Great attempt, but tasted more like Campbell soup. And how in the world can you have the waiter ask would you like to add shrimp for an additional $8.00 ??? Seriously ?? Who comes up with this crap ? You're not on the beach in Dana Point. Im sure it's an attempt to cover your rent, but don't trick the customer, we won't come back.  The muffalatta sandwich was decent, again overpriced at $14.00, I would rather go to Jason's Deli orvwaitbuntil the next Orleans trip.  The chicken and biscuits for $19.00, come on ?? !! Yeah it had a hybrid, northern California flare, but it wasn't reminiscent of anything from the South. Why serve over biscuits and call it dumplings, that's just some cook, trying to make a signature attempt at a chef.  Now the worst part, the desserts. $8.00 for something a kindergarten teacher would throw together from leftover lunch box scraps. The banana pudding was Jello brand with a store bought Ginger snap and freeze dried banana chips thrown on top ?? My grandmother would call 911 if she was eating that crap.   The \"German Chocolate\" cake ? I'm German and this should be sent to Canada for a hockey puck. One tiny little smear of store bought icing over a little Debbie cake ??  I am blown away by the reviews for this place, are they all paid or just friends of the staff and owner.  I will say the location, decor and ambiance was really hip, slick and cool, but unless you get a chef with some true Southern knowledge, you will see a Grand closing within a year.  The only way I'm coming back is for the cofee and Begneits, they were pretty good and at least enough to share for $8.00.   Sorry to be so critical, but when you pay $130.00 for dinner without cocktails, it better be better than Cracker Barrell, sorry very dissatisfied. Having lived in the valley for over 30 years, original native, I had my expectations of revisiting the Beefeater once again and boy was I sucker punched.  The service was great, except all plates cleared while we were still eating. One in our party had to finish alone while we all sat there with nothing in front of us, minor change needed.   Very, very clean !!"}
{"text":"After reading all of the negative reviews, I was a bit skeptical of dining at Southern Rail. The entire experience was just wonderful and I'm glad I ignored these reviews! I've dined extensively in Europe...I know what good food is! I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken and biscuit dumplings and was also able to sample the pork tenderloin. If you're not a picky eater, you'll certainly enjoy the yummy vegetables. Collard greens and sweet potatoes...doesn't get any better! We finished our meal with beignets...almost as good as Cafe du Monde in New Orleans! Plus, our waitress was a real gem and checked on us multiple times. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was nice. But it was very loud. We ordered the blt salad, fried green tomatoes and the trout and smoked chicken gumbo as a small plate. We were very disappointed. The salad was literally a 1/3 a wedge that was tiny sitting on a thin layer of thousand island with 4 cherry tomatoes. And a light sprinkle of bacon bits and a lousy presentation. Hardly worth 10$. Were were there for a friends 80th birthday so we ordered pie in a jar. I've ate in many southern restaruants I and I've eaten pie in a jar. The southern rails interpretation is more like pie in a cup. And it was tiny. Any ways we never got past the appetizers. For four appetizers 1 beer 2 glasses of wine and 1 desert it came to just over 100$. The service was good. And very helpful. The hostess was the best part of our meal. Sad to know that they are associated with Beckett's table because we eat there regularly."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow, WOW! We had the most amazing meal here this passed weekend. I had an out of town guest with me from Georgia and not only did he say that it was the best meal he'd had since we started our \"let's go to all the awesome restaurants in Scottsdale, Tempe and Phoenix\" but that the food was better than in the South! The whipped mashed sweet potatoes were insanely delicious. I'm not a huge fan of collard greens but these I gobbled up! The best part was the pork (loin? Chop?) I should know better as much as I eat out. ....but it was like a chicken breast. Thick, juicy, and perfectly flavored,  I'll share a secret with you bc it was soooooo good that maybe someone at becketts will see this & add it to the menu! Get the plain green salad (which is not plain at all, had lots of yummy veggies in it!) AND the cornbread salad & mix them TOGETHER! Our \"on point\" waiter thought we were crazy to mix the dressings but it all worked and was sooooo good! Sort of want that for lunch now! Also, the cocktails were killer! As a side note, our server was so awesome & patient with this AZ native not knowing anything about southern food, he was HAPPY to explain everything to me & never showed any annoyance with my southern cuisine ignorance. Definitely worth the drive from south tempe! Thank you Southern Rail for making me look really good to my guest! I'll see you soon bc EVERYTHING on the menu sounded good!!!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate here Saturday night with another couple.  First off, I was disappointed that they only have fried chicken on Wednesdays (and our waiter said there is a limited quantity even then so plan to eat earlier rather than later if that's what you're after).  Their menu is somewhat limited so be sure to check it out beforehand if you have picky eaters in your party. Our table had the pork loin, which was EXCELLENT, the smoked trout (not really up my alley; my fiancé wasn't over the moon about it), the macaroni and cheese (I had a bite - wasn't a huge fan, but I'm a mac and cheese connoisseur), the gumbo which I didn't try, cornbread, and the beignets. Our service was top notch.  My fiancé loves olives and with both of his martinis  the waiter brought him five or six olives.  He also remembered to bring regular better along with the apple butter as I requested with our cornbread and he was ever so patient with me and my several questions! If the menu looks tempting to you, try it out.  I don't think you'll be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went for Christmas Eve with family and was extremely disappointed. The place was so loud we could not talk. Our first waiter took our order for appetizers and then had someone else deliver them. Those were tasty-the okra and the sampler platter. Ordered a few of their fancy cocktails but they were all almost undrinkable because of the heavy pour of bitters.  Finally the waiter came back and said someone else would be taking our table because he was too busy elsewhere. This new guy finally took our dinner orders after we had finished the apps and sat for about 20 minutes. We ordered chicken and dumplings, gumbo, steak and pork loin. The steak was the only meal that was really good. The pork loin was tough, the gumbo was mediocre, and the chicken and dumplings was almost inedible with heavily smoked and mushy chicken, a ton of half cooked carrots, and chunks of already baked biscuit that had been added to the gravy as dumplings. Dumb lungs are NOT baked biscuits smothered in gravy. Overall a very disappointing experience and definitely not worth the $200+ charges. I can't recommend anything but if you do end up there, stick to the appetizers. The meals suck."}
{"text":"Jesus!! This place is great, I had the pork loin but dined with relatives so I tried a bunch of things off of the menu and it was worth every single dollar. The restaurant has a wonderful ambience and the service was excellent. I have been restaurant hopping around Phoenix and after about fifteen or so meals at their competition and neighbors, Southern Rail would definitely be in the top 3. Wonderful place and it took my by surprise, give this place a chance!"}
{"text":"I was here before and had a relatively good experience but I came back and I was charged for a dish that was never delivered and my server was so dismissive I did not see him after the food came to ask what happened to the dish. I was with guests and it wasn't until I got home that I realized I paid for the dish I didn't get. The food was not cooked as well like a little raw and not in a good way and my salad was bitter. I am not thrilled and will not be back. I don't like inconsistent places."}
{"text":"Seth was a great waiter. Was always there without being intrusive. The food was great. A little pricey, but as my partner said \"You pay for the environment\". Definitely a nice place to share a great dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome server Chris recommended the fried green tomatoes they are fantastic! Great service great menu can't wait to have brunch. Every time I come here the service is better than the time before. Would recommend hands down."}
{"text":"Waiter Dusty was fabulous. Food was great atmosphere was awesome. Anniversary next week I know where we are going....."}
{"text":"Excellent prices for the social hour menu, unbeatable service and top notch food. For starters we had the fried green tomatoes, which were the best I've ever had in Phoenix. The dirty rice balls were even better though, pairing exceptionally well with sweet corn relish and smoked onion cream sauce. I nearly licked the plate clean!   The cocktails here are otherworldly and the bartenders really know their craft. We talked intently about whiskeys and down-home fried southern cooking and I can't remember the last time I was so impressed with a drink as I was with the hush puppy hush. I could get away with ordering pink fruity martinis more often I wouldn't drink anything else!   We will be back soon for fall restaurant week to try their fried okra, duck confit, and black forest chocolate cake. I must say, I'm excited to return."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  As fan of Beckett's Table, I hoped to enjoy this new venture, but no such luck.  Maybe southern food should just stay in the south where it belongs.  The so-called crispy duck was neither crispy nor tasty -- just a bland piece of poultry with soggy skin.  Another issue:  when rolls are available only as an a la carte item, they should be served with the drinks or other appetizers, not simultaneously with the presentation of the entrees.  I may go back to Beckett's Table, but not to Southern Rail."}
{"text":"Yep, def a little loud in there. But if you want a cool ceiling you can't have egg carton foam or a typ drop.  Chicken & dumplings dish was good almost great, a tad salty.  But we sweat a lot in PHX and need to replace the salt!  The shrimp...fantastic.  Nice bottled beer selection  And finally!!!!!!.....for the first time in my life a server noticed when i was in the middle of a story/joke and was coming by the table & didn't interrupt! Wish i cld remember her name!"}
{"text":"We have visited Southern Rail a number of times and this visit was the best. Live Jazz on the patio and the food was amazing!  I had Blackened Flatiron Steak with Collard Greens and my husband had the Chicken and Dumplings. Have to tell you he was eating out of my plate!"}
{"text":"The food, the service, the atmosphere...spectacular! Feels like home the second you walk in. I've had a taste of almost everything on the menu and nothing has ever been short of my expectations. Fried green tomatoes with the pimento spread is a winner. The pork loin is out of this world. If you're down to get dirty with some New Orleans inspired dishes the head on BBQ shrimp is hands down amazing. Now onto desert if you can fit anything more the beignets are pockets of heaven..just make sure you know how to eat them without getting the sugar dust everywhere! Amazing people and the work of a genius! Thank you Justin Beckett as always for an amazing dinner and Scott for such a warm welcoming! A+++++++"}
{"text":"Good but certainly not wonderful. Four of us decided to try it and all ordered something different. We all agreed the best of the night was the service and the atmosphere. Loud, but we expected that, they retained alot of the original decor which was a very nice touch. Food....it was ok. Expensive for the small portions in our opinion and we all agreed this would not be visited by any of us again. Wasn't worth the $$$$ spent for the food received. We actually went somewhere else later and had desert and \"good\" coffee and discussed the new try. Again, it was the consensus of the group to NOT include the Southern Rail in our place to visit. We are not big eaters, but the portions were pretty small for $$$ charged. The salads were the biggest disappointment as there was no dressing to taste, the salads tasted like washed lettuce and no garnish and very little dressing. The entrees were very small portions and certainly not worth the price. Overall our expectation was to have a great time at an old place we had visited for years, enjoy a super dinner, and talk. We did not accomplish any of this. Best time was the book store next door. Oh, by the way...............DO NOT ORDER COFFEE...... they should offer \"fresh' coffee or have an espresso bar for pour overs or americano's, capps, lats, etc."}
{"text":"Went on a recommendation from a relative, To begin: our table was \"sticky\", past that we ordered appetizers including deviled eggs- they were very bland tasting, also had green tomatoes which come with a pimento type dressing- very overpowering. Then we ordered the fried chicken the texture of the meat was great but the seasoning on the outside was awful... what made it all worse was that this is where I chose to take my wife for fee birthday dinner, OMG!!! Will NEVER go back- Oh yeh, forgot to mention that my wife asked for the banana pudding for desert- tasted like Jello Brand pudding with banana \"chips\" and a ginger cookie, who is the chef in this place? I mean Dam!!!!"}
{"text":"Pork ribs were nothing but fat and a little tough meat. The rest, including drinks, 3 appetizers, a small dish and dessert, were mediocre and overpriced. We were disappointed."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant. The food was authentic to what I remember southern food was made when growing up in East Tennessee. Food  seemed to lean more towards Louisiana style southern food but nothing wrong with that. Phoenix needs this restaurant and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"05/16/2015 around 4:45 pm  They had a wine crawl that you could sample 3 wines for about $3 a good deal , we didn't participate.  We arrived a bit early for dinner service and the employees were off to the side having a shift meeting ( some would say this shouldn't have been seen , done in the background , but it kind of impressed me that they were taking the time for training the staff and later it showed in the service) .  we had a before dinner drink they were made right not to strong just right on .  We decided to go with the special $33 for 3 courses , Starter , Main , and Dessert . We both chose Pork loin served on mashed sweet potatoes and Kale/Collard greens ( not sure here) it was done very well , Service was spot on ( one of my pet peeves is the tables , set up .. I noticed all salt shakers were full , I think its lazy for a restaurant to not have a clean full set up each time example being soy sauce at most Asian restaurants) so that said all tables looked well done. Service was spot on we asked for dessert to go and the communication between staff was well executed.  management did well was very hands on was willing to take my order, make suggestions and even do the seating , also noticed manager was working behind the bar helping out.... getting a bit tired of typing I could say a lot more ... I give this a strong must see place"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this was one of the worst restaurants I have been to in a long time. The food is bland and the service was poor. I brought my friend here during restaurant week, but opted to order off of the menu instead of the restaurant week one. We ordered: friend green tomatoes, Mac n cheese, ribs, gumbo, wedge salad, collard greens, and the red velvet cake. None of which was good. Such a disappointment too because we were so excited to eat here as we are both foodies and love trying new local spots!"}
{"text":"Just okay. The BLT salad is a wedge salad, which I don't care for (not a fan of iceberg lettuce). Perhaps that was mentioned on the menu, but didn't catch it. Essentially was an expensive snack. Spouse had the roast beef po'boy, which was just okay. Fries were terrific.   Service was polite but not attentive. This is our second visit to this restaurant and although the surroundings are beautiful, we probably won't go out of our way to eat here again."}
{"text":"I went very excited on thursday to enjoy the meatloaf. unfortunately it was just plain not good. It could have been anything molded into a cube or loaf with only the flavor of the bbq sauce or the pepper in the meatloaf.  I spent years traveling the south on Business, Savannah, New Orleans, Dallas, and all in between and never have I had meatloaf even remotely like this. The brocolli was good, and the potato salad was ok.  My friend  had appetizers only, the smoked trout and the onion tomato tart both fab!. The corn bread was great! The desert, coconut cake, was just ok but the Beignets (sp?) were over the top. I hope in the outside month that you can sit outside and order coffee and the Beignets....then worth the trip. I spend so much time at Becketts table because it is really good! This.....well, they need to close for a month, take a road trip south, spend some time with Art Smith, Paul Prudhomme, and yes Paula Deen, to name a few. Then regroup.  I'm not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"Gourmet Southern, that's what the food here is!   We tried just about every item on the social hour menu (that's the menu between lunch and dinner) and I can't tell you which plate, or drink, was the best because we couldn't agree on it. They were all fantastic. We moved from the bar to a lovely table in the back room for dinner and were again thrilled by the offerings. Smoked trout, chicken with bread dumplings, peel and eat shrimp, and, of course, bread pudding with bourbon sauce for desert. Because... Southern! Now, about the service. We were here on a Friday without having made a reservation. It was my mother-in-law's 70th birthday and we weren't certain she would be able to go out for dinner. The staff handled all of that for us and gave us a great experience where many other restaurants could (and probably would) have gone the other way on such a busy night. So a big thank-you to Hunter and Jacob."}
{"text":"Always had great service here. The people are friendly and sweet and very helpful. Every dish I've ever gotten I have absolutely loved. I miss the pan-seared trout, but the new smoked trout is almost just as good. I love sitting at the bar because the bartenders are always really nice, friendly and very helpful. I just love this place."}
{"text":"An excellent dining experience with a thoroughly delightful waitress. Food was excellent! Good southern taste. Generally Southern cooking means deep fried grease. Not the case here. Just good down wholesome healthy food."}
{"text":"I've had two delicious dinners here, both served by the incredibly accommodating and gracious Thomas. The menu is compelling, the drinks are delicious and strong, and the music is spot-on.  Ribs, fried green tomatoes, jambalaya: all with a unique delivery but all superb."}
{"text":"The food is simply delicious. The building is amazing and the staff are great. Definitely one of the best restaurants in Az."}
{"text":"Terrible service and small servings that are over priced. It was our first time and will no doubt be our last. The menu doesn't describe the dishes in detail like that something comes with mushrooms so if you don't like that there is no chance to have it taken off. When asked by the waiter to have them removed it took 3 times to get him to understand I wanted my meal simply without them. He tried offering me a different dish and even argued he told us it had mushrooms when in fact he didn't. Just wasn't the restaurant environment we are use to and won't return. Unfriendly staff! Def will not ever recommend."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere, great service, so-so food for the price. I love the Changing Hands bookstore next to this restaurant, so I thought I might as well pop in for some dinner with my husband. The outside patio was participating in the Urban Ale Trail at the  time, which sounded interesting, but my husband and I don't drink, so we went for a table inside.  The interior decor was modern and comfortable. Our waitress was the perfect model of what a waitress should be, very attentive and friendly. Unfortunately, the food was a bit of a let down. I ordered the pork loin and my husband ordered the goulash. Both were under seasoned. Nice size potions, just not worth the price. I expect something particularly tasty for $25 a plate!"}
{"text":"A for ambiance, B- for food.   Justin Beckett has done an excellent job of rehabbing this old restaurant into an attractive compound of businesses that includes Southern Rail and First Draft Book Bar. Southern Rail is the crown jewel. The booths are holdovers from Beefeaters, but everything else seems to be new. I especially liked the large windows that open up to a patio facing Camelback; the light rail whizzes right past.   I was mixed on the food and drinks. I got a Rail Runner, which didn't taste as good as the description (bulleit bourbon, lemonade, soda) and came in a fairly small julep cup. The cornbread was tasty and I liked the accompanying black pepper honey butter, but it only came with 3 small cornbread muffins. My wife got the flatiron, which was cooked well and had a bit of spice to it that we enjoyed. Surprisingly, my gumbo was not spicy at all. The andouille sausage was pretty good (but still not that spicy), but everything else fell flat. That was the most disappointing, as the gumbo seems to be one of the featured items. The mac n' cheese came to the rescue, however. You'd think mac n' cheese would always be good, but I've had some fairly mediocre mac at restaurants, so I complement Southern Rail's.  All of the foregoing could be forgiven except for the fact that Southern Rail is pricey. Being pricey is okay where you feel like you're getting the right bang for the buck, like at the sister restaurant Beckett's Table, but that wasn't the case for me here. The high price point makes me consider this more of a 2.5 star review."}
{"text":"My husband loves the chicken dumplings. I'm vegetarian, so I have to chose from the salad selection. It would be nice to have a meatless entree, but I'm used to the lack of not veg options at restaurants. The dark haired bartender is knowledgeable about Gin, which is great because unfortunately, most bartenders are not. Drinks were good, cornbread and brioche were great, and I'm a sucker for Mac n Cheese. The best part, however, is being next to changing hands book store. I give it a 4 for meat lovers and drinks, and 2 1/2 for vegetarians. Cool atmosphere, but beware the table bases- they are metal with corners and easy to hit your legs on."}
{"text":"If you want to be called a bunch of freeloaders who need to settle down, then this is the place for you.   We came for the $25 BBQ & bourbon deal, for the second time, our first BBQ & bourbon experience was great.   We ordered knowing the deal came with a platter of BBQ and two Bourbon drinks. As we finished the platter and our first two drinks, another round of drinks came to our table. We said we didn't order those, and the server took the drinks back. Few minutes go by and the server comes back with the drinks and asks why are we sending drinks back that come with the platter. He clarified that our platter came with 2 drinks per person, so we then take the drinks after they had come back after the initial confusion.   We didn't think much of this until it came time to settle the bill. This is where things started to go downhill, fast.   The server brings our bill out and we have been charged for the platter and drinks all separately. As if there was no $25 bourbon & bbq deal. We then realized there was a mistake in the server bringing out the second round of drinks. We brought this up with the server multiple times, but we were having issues getting is resolved, so the manager came out to us.   We were hoping that the manager would apologize for the confusion and hear us out with the mistake that was made. Instead he tells our friend that was trying to explain the situation to settle down and accuses us of complaining about the situation to just get free drinks.   I would understand if we had originally taken the second round without sending it back because we didn't order the drinks, but we sent them back and they were brought right back over.   Service was fine, it was busy at the restaurant, so can imagine he already had his hands full. But the way management responded to our issue was just unacceptable. This is the last time I will be recommending Southern Rail to friends.   Also as a side note, the yelp page says it's a $20 BBQ & bourbon deal, which is definitely incorrect."}
{"text":"We visited Southern Rail on a lovely Phoenix \"fall\" Sunday morning for brunch.  We sat out on the patio.   It was 10:45am and still relatively quiet.     We started our brunch by sharing the ultimate sticky bun, pecans, icing($5), which was large enough to share a few bites between 4 people.   We loved it.  For my main course, I ordered the fried green tomato benedict, biscuit, tomato jam, creole hollandaise, frisee salad ($13).  The creole hollandaise sauce was not too spicy.  It was definately a favorite at the table!   My son ordered the SR bread pudding french toast, banana caramel bourbon sauce ($11).  Yes, they turned the bread pudding into french toast -- genious! (I'm going to try this out at home.)  Ding. Ding.  Winner.  Our friend ordered the shrimp and grits ($13).  She thought it was delicious, but it was very greasy (as in the oil was pooling to the side of the grits.     I ordered a Bloody Mary, which I promptly gave to my husband.  I think it must be made with \"creole\" spices and I much prefer a more simpler version with my horse-radish.  Definately consider Southern Rail for an early morning lunch -- it's realtively quite and the menu interesting.  I love the architectural space and decore of Southern Rail -- very open, airy, urban, with lots of outdoor bar and patio space for us to enjoy the good weather we have in Phoenix.  I would definately put this on the top of the list to bring visitors and family members from out of town.  It's a great space for happy hour too.     And bonus:  After Brunch, we stimulated the economy at \"Changing Hands Bookstore\" located there on the premises."}
{"text":"Some of the best gumbo I've had. Had the smoked chicken gumbo with a spicy bloody Mary. Perfect way to start some brunch. On point!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great! The service was also great, however the food really left more to be desired.  I felt the food really was not very good and it was rather cold and overpriced. We went in for brunch and left disappointed. The gumbo was very bland and the portions and incredibly small for the price."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, beautiful decor and good service. My big issue is the price. Way too expensive for regular visits. Brunch for two was nearly $40 with tip,"}
{"text":"Beautiful reuse of an old classic building, the wood ceiling, brick walls, old tile and mirror all add up to a nice space.  But the noise, oh the noise!  I felt like I was a victim of auditory assault!  Contemporary Southern Food made for an interesting menu but the \"hearty\" fish and shrimp jambalaya was more of a nice fish dish not at all a jambalaya (and shrimp were so shrimpy they were nonexistent.) Please don't call a dish something that's it's not.  Best looking dishes of the night were companions' pork chop and the tomato tart.  Service needs some fine tuning.  Small plates as appetizers came out at the same time as main course and drinks and dishes were randomly put down in front of diners. Finally, if you can't make separate checks but will take different credit cards for different amounts, then at least put the right amount on each card please.  With the same parents as Beckett's Table, I know this baby is going to work out the growing pains and will be an asset to the 'hood soon!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying Southern Rail. Overall the food was excellent and the service was really really great. The reason I only gave 3 stars is because I thought it was WAY overpriced and the head on shrimp were terribly overlooked, tough and dry. Fried green tomatoes, chilled corn soup and bread pudding were awesome."}
{"text":"Well having once lived in Alabama and Oklahoma I was expecting some old fashion southern cooking hence the name \"Souther Rail\" That was not the case. I started with the appetizer fried green tomatoes.  The totatoes were small I felt like a giant eating them. Biting into them did not really taste the tomato as much as I did the crispy coating.  I added 3 sugars into the sweet tea. As an entree I had the chicken and dumplings.  It reminded me more of a soup with vegetables and bread.The broth was tasty but just missing the mark on sothern cooking for me. For desert had the coconut cake. It was tasty but a  little bit dry. The resturant itself is beautiful and comfortable, but I was a little disappointed.  I think there are a few things you just dont mess with and that is real southern cooking that looks and taste like someone's mother or grandmother made. I dont think I will return. I do hope you like it, but its not for me."}
{"text":"Extremely impressed by the quality and creativity of the dishes. Very friendly staff and nice environment."}
{"text":"While it's a great location.... Great ambience. Fun atmosphere. Food took over 45 minutes to reach the table. Not complicated or hard to make food, not a packed house, now I know why. I ordered drinks from the bar, no server in sight. Just lots of smiles from passing staff. I won't bother coming here to eat again. I might just swing in for a drink. I'll eat somewhere else before I come back here. Giant let down."}
{"text":"Great service.   Attentive and friendly.   Roast beef Po boy was really good.   Nice horseradish bite.  The gumbo was unique.   Less new Orleans and more of a beef stew.   Different but good.   Nice ambience and beautiful interior."}
{"text":"We called the restaurant and confirmed they served till 10pm. We arrived at 9:20pm. As we were being taken to our seat, the manager stopped us to inform us that the kitchen was closed. Only cocktails were available. We were not pleased with this communication and service."}
{"text":"Went with two friends last night. Overall a solid place. NOISE is a major issue, we were seated in the back room and I can honestly say the noise level was the worst of any place I've ever eaten and have lived in five major cities before Phoenix. Hopefully they can go back to their designer and see if they can't do something. My friends said they would not go back because it was so unpleasant. So the decor looks cool, but doesn't function well. The food was pretty good, two of us had the Gumbo and it was excellent. One person has the fried chicken special and it was overcooked, actually some of the crust was black from overcooking. The side potatoes were meh that came with the chicken. The server was super nice and helpful, but he also was having a hard time giving service because of the noise level. None of us had dessert, but they had some tempting options. I personally will go again! Maybe when they open for lunch and try to get in the main room."}
{"text":"Ordered cat fish and shrimp and grits dinner to go. Got home and found an old and disgusting fish po boy and horrific grits. Spit everything out and threw it away. The worst food ever you should be ashamed of yourselves. Health department please investigate!"}
{"text":"Had another nice evening at this charming restaurant last night with two of my friends.  For a Saturday night it wasn't crowded at all and the friendly hostesses (including Chef's wife, seated us outside promptly).  After several minutes of no attention we went to the hostess stand and asked for a waiter and one came right over and apologized and took our appetizer and drinks order.  The Chef's wife then came over to us and apologized and bought us a round of drinks (which she didn't have to do).  The fried green tomatoes and brioche rolls were excellent, and our entree's of fried chicken and chicken and dumpling's were excellent too.  We have been to this casual dining spot a number of times and have never been disappointed.  Tonight was just another example of why we return.  Great service and good food will never go out of style!"}
{"text":"Want the worst martini in town? Wand fried green tomatoes that have such a small sliver of tomatoes as to not taste them? Want the smallest serving of salmon ever? Want the tinies sides of cauliflower and spinach? How about greasy beignets? This is the place!"}
{"text":"The best dinner night out with my wife in a long time.  Service was great. Food was great too. It was a happy place with talk and laughter all around you. The whole restaurant was ablaze with life and patrons having a great evening. Gotta go back."}
{"text":"I love Beckettt's Table and eat there frequently, so of course I was eager to check this place.  Some things at Southern Rail are absolutely spectacular.  The physical reinvention of space that is The Newton is a real treasure, possibly the most beautiful Urban Dining spot in Phoenix.  The drinks are awesome -- I had an updated Sazerac that just sang on my palate.  The service is a joy, just like Beckett's Table.  But the menu is not quite as tightly controlled as at Chef Justin's earlier place;  while my Duck Confit rocked, and their Brioche Parker House Rolls are transcendent, my companion's Pork Loin was overcooked to the point of dreadful, shoe leather quality dryness..  The dessert selections are rather more interesting at Beckett's Table as well.  Restaurants can all have off menu choices or line cook mistakes, so I'm not going to give SR a thumbs down.  But when so many other elements were so perfect, I must be honest and say that a classic Southern Pork Loin that was so badly managed is disappointing.  Looking forward to going back, however."}
{"text":"Great experience, friendly wait staff and a cool location. We got drinks and shared an appetizer and a \"large plate\" and we were pretty happy with our meal. 4 stars because we couldn't get a table without a reservation (or an hour wait) but we really did enjoy the time we had in the bar area! No regrets! Check it out and if you have time, stop at changing hands next door!"}
{"text":"In meeting Justin Beckett at McClarendons Farmers Market I am Extremely Disappointed and shocked"}
{"text":"Lived in Phoenix for three years, the smoked trout is easily the best meal I've had here. But don't sit outside, the exhaust from the cars is not pleasant."}
{"text":"Food was great,  service from Chris was probably the best I have had at a restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I just had a small dinner meeting in the private dining room. It was fantastic! Dinner was excellent. All of my guest gave it rave reviews. They especially loved the duck and the Wednesday special of fried chicken. The dessert cannot be missed! The private room was perfect. Not too loud at all. Our server, Chris, was funny and attentive! The whole evening went off beautifully. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Dutch pancake here with honey lemonade.   I've never had this before.   I was quite impressed. .. it was really good."}
{"text":"I have to commend them because they took a 20 party reservation with only a days notice. With that being said, the service was not he best. Not once did the servers come by after serving us drinks to see if we needed refills.  Be aware if you bring in a cake they charge a $2 per plate cutting fee. Easy to do the math 2x20= $40. They do not split the bill. I would not recommend the red beans and rice, pulled chicken and dumplings, or the cornbread. Red beans and rice and chicken and dumplings lacked flavor. Corn bread was very dry. I will visit again with hopes the service is better with a smaller party and to eat the meals that were a success, the fried chicken and ribs looked delicious and those who ordered said they were."}
{"text":"Delicious meal! I understand the the higher prices come at the cost of eating predominantly local fresh ingredients. I am 100%ok with this! We ordered the bacon onion tart with delicious tomatoes baked on top. Amazing. Our meals were delicious, both the pork loin and catfish were tasty. Beautiful set up, not too crowded and loved the booths. Can't wait for the full patio to open up. Great job, we will be back!"}
{"text":"We had a triple date at SR and it was awesome. We ordered several apps: corn bread, brioche, dirty rice croquettes and fried green tomatoes. They were all delicious. Then we got a couple peel and eat shrimp and a couple chicken and biscuits at the table as well as a pork loin. Everyone cleaned their plate. We finished it off with bread pudding, red velvet cake and coconut cake. Our serve Sara was friendly, attentive and fun and we sat and enjoyed the great food and each other's company for 3 hours. What a great night. I wasn't sure what to expect since I haven't loved the food at Becketts's and there were some early reviews and them having to work the kinks of a new place out but id say they are worked out! We also started our night at the first draft bar at changing hands. I think we will hang at this new plaza quite often."}
{"text":"First time coming to this place and let me tell you....we will be back. Our server Jordan was excellent!! He walked us through each menu item, gave us his suggestions and recommendations and was just awesome. Service is HUGE in my book and Jordan knocked it out of the park!! This place has a great ambiance and atmosphere.  Can't wait to come back and try the dinner menu. Great way to start off a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"I had the duck....excellent, excellent, excellent.  My wife had the Gumbo, a complete miss.  How do you miss on gumbo when your a southern restaurant is beyond me.  Taking both of the plates into consideration and the fact that i thought it was overpriced, took it to a 3 star.    Separate note, the design and remodel of the old building is cool and worth checking out."}
{"text":"Wow! A long overdue delicious meal.  I was pleasantly surprised, in a good way.  I had the chicken and dumplings, I thought it was going to be on a dinner plate, but was actually served as a soup.  It was incredibly delicious.  My friend had their Thursday special of Grandmama's meatloaf.  Another yummy tasty meal.  We shared the beignets and bread pudding for desert. Again, YUM~ there is no other way to say it~  We both laughed and said, we are going to have to roll out of here, we were stuffed...ya think? It did get kinda noisy, but we were next to the community table near the bar.  A place with great food, and great service.  It just tells me that everyone was having a great time.  I will go back there in a heart beat."}
{"text":"If you are going to serve any type of eggs Benedict, serve a poached egg. Everything on the plate was delightful, but you serve a soft boiled egg??? Come on."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this restaurant. As big fans of Beckett's Table we thought this would be the best new restaurant. Not so much.   With four of us...two had meat loaf and two had pork tenderloin.  Both dishes, especially the tenderloin were EXTREMELY dry.   To their credit the very nice manager offered us free desert for the poor food experience.  The bread \"pudding\" was essentially a piece of French toast...umm not so good.  The beignets however were very good.  All four of us decided we would not return...too many other great options in the Camelback | Central area.  Hopefully they can figure this out and turn things around.  They have invested a lot of money in this establishment to not have it be successful."}
{"text":"Gave \"Southern Rail\" another shot. I won't go back.  Went with 3 girlfriends this time and we all felt the menu wasn't that girl friendly as it's all pretty heavy food.  We ordered 2-3 items each and none of it blew us away and we left disappointed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. (A little loud when sitting on the patio that runs along Camelback though.) Great service and loved the location.  Food was good in theory, but the execution (and pricing) weren't just not as good as you would expect. Ok  to good, but not great.   We liked the experience enough to try it again - so we'll see how the food is next time."}
{"text":"The reviews for this place have been mixed; here's my take.  Atmosphere - Good; Service - Good; Prices - Average; Portions - Small (you don't get much for your money); Food - mediocre at best. We had reservations and were seated promptly.  Service was friendly and attentive.  For an appetizer we ordered their \"signature\" Fried Green Tomatoes.  $9 for 3 tomato slices that were heavily covered with cornmeal - too much coating.  For my entrée I had the Smoked Chicken & Grilled Andouille Gumbo.  It was the best dish of the evening however it was unlike any Gumbo I've ever had - tasty but nothing like what you get in Louisiana.  Again, very small portion especially considering it is listed on the menu as a \"Large Plate\" dinner entrée.  My companion ordered the la Plancha Blackened Catfish and she did not care for it at all.  A thin piece of fish heavily coated in corn meal with no detectable Blackened spice.  All you could taste was deep-fried cornmeal.   There are a few decent Cajun/Creole restaurants in the Phoenix area.  This is not one of them."}
{"text":"My husband and I went based on other reviews and it did not disappoint. While the restaurant was a bit loud, the food was exceptional. We shared a small plate of the gumbo and it was extremely flavorful. I had the flat iron steak and it was delicious. Cooked to perfection, seared and flavorful, and very tender. My husband had the duck confit with the risotto. He said he hadn't enjoyed a meal as much as this one in the last 10 years.   The staff was wonderful. Knowledgeable and offered great information based on our questions.   We would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"It was one of those Bleak hot summer days in Phoenix, only 10 degrees hotter because the adult children were in town. It worked out that we had to have a late lunch so we thought we'd try this place. They also offered offered us the happy hour menu.  We all really liked our meals and i thought my old fashion was excellent."}
{"text":"I have visited Southern Rail twice now. As a native Southerner, I very much appreciate anywhere outside the South that is able to hold a candle to real Southern food. I also appreciate the elevation of Southern food outside fried foods and meat. Southern Rail does all of that.   First of all, the vegetable small plates are fantastic. I highly recommend the butter beans and garden peas. The beans are cooked until just soft, the lemon zest is a zingy addition, and the crispy chicken skin makes for a great crunch. Another standout is the grilled watermelon salad, which is as tasty as it is beautiful. My girlfriend is a vegetarian, so any Southern restaurant that lets her eat is a huge bonus.  On my last visit, I had the ribs, which were just the right level of sweet and spicy, falling off the bone, and delicious. My dad had the fried chicken and really enjoyed it. And the peach and pickle relish? Delicious.  To finish, order the bread pudding. With a whiskey sauce, it's a real winner. Also, consider any of the whiskey cocktails--a must for a Southern meal.   To summarize--y'all come!"}
{"text":"The manager asked my friend if she needed basic math explained to her when there was a small discrepancy with the bill... Quality wise this is maybe a slight step above Dickey's. At least the managers at Dickey's don't insult customers trying to resolve a simple bill problem. The waiting staff were all amazing and if they get a new manager this would be a great place to go eat. Until then avoid at all costs..."}
{"text":"Southern Rail is a southern twist on the American comfort food formula very successfully deployed at Beckett's Table. There is certainly an emphasis on quality and local produce, which is commendable. The food is good and very tasty, so that part of the SR experience will not let you down. The service is impeccable too, another hallmark of Beckett's Table. Plates are cleared promptly, none are left to linger. The wait staff seems to know exactly how present to be, neither hovering nor constantly interrupting nor absent.  However the menu is quite limited in its choices, and I found several entrees to be overpriced. I ordered the BLT Chopped Salad, being not terribly famished. For $10 it was acceptable, though I didn't quite understand the mushy cherry tomatoes. The generous portions of thick bacon added a nice flavor to it. However I was very put off by the option of adding protein to the salad for $6 to $7. Now you are talking nearly $20 for a farking salad.  My wife ordered one of the steak entrees, the blackened prime flatiron steak priced at $27. The steak itself, while a good cut of meat and very tender, was embarrassingly small. This was not made up for by the homestyle mashed potatoes and McLendon Farms vegetables that accompanied it. Our dining companions ordered the gumbo (judged excellent) and the red beans and rice (judged so-so).  For dessert, beignets (excellent) and banana pudding (divine; the wife said \"I don't ever want this to leave my mouth!\")  We won't mind returning to SR if asked to do so by friends; but we won't insist on going there. We'll go to Beckett's Table instead."}
{"text":"AMAZING dinner!  Upscale southern with a relaxed indoor/outdoor atmosphere.  I had the special which was a southern/Asian fusion soba noodle bowl with perfectly cooked piece of fried chicken sitting on top of soba and broth.  It came with chef made pickled vegetables, a perfectly cooked soft boiled egg and collard greens.  Fried green tomato with pimiento cheese appetizer was also very good.  We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Joined some friends here who enjoy supporting new restaurants in the valley. I always stick with the standards and ordered the roast beef po boy. The meat was terrible. I tried eating the 1st half of the sandwich and 1/2 the meat was uneatable, which had to be put in a napkin. I attempted to try the 2nd half and realized it was just as bad. I dinner mates enjoyed their meals but my experience tells me not to try it again."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here.  Service was good, attentive without being obtrusive.  Food was very good though my medium rare steak was quite well done.  We did have to wait a while for it (ok since appetizers came fast and we were not starving anymore) so I didn't complain because I didn't want to be eating differently from my table.  This restaurant has a lot of vegetable dishes (not necessarily vegetarian) which seem to be where their strengths are.  I enjoyed the vegetables my steak came with more than I enjoyed the steak.  Mostly because it was so overcooked.  We tried their cauliflower casserole and collard greens and salads and it was all very good.  I highly recommend the cauliflower casserole even if you are a total carnivore.  It would be 5 stars if they could figure out how to make their meats as good as their vegetables.  They may need to hire another chef to oversee the meat dishes while keeping their vegetable master on the vegie dishes."}
{"text":"We were in Phoneix for less than a week on vacation. Typically, our vacation food rules are no fast food or chain restaurants and no repeats. We broke the last part of the rule for Southern Rail. Discovered it by accident on our first night in town and then decided to go back our last night because it was so good! I had the Camelback Salad and he had the Muffaletta Burger. Both times. The salad was crisp and filled with flavor and HUGE! Loved the house made dressing! Muffaletta Burger was amazing, cooked to perfection and my husband still hasn't stopped talking about the olive tampenade and the cured meats grilled to crispy but somehow still juicy. It's become his favorite topic of conversation of late. Will definitely return and look forward to trying new things (but let's be real, we are probably just going to order the same thing again)."}
{"text":"The food there was mediocre. I felt like the Fried Chicken had entirely too much breading . The chicken and dumplings tasted nothing like I've had before and not in a good way. We had reservations that still took a while for them to sit us.  We were finally seated it took them quite a while for them to come and ask us what we wanted to order. We finally had to have the manager come to explain what was happening. Unfortunately he didn't really make it sound like it was a big deal almost like we were complaining. I can't think of his name but he was tall and bald . Unfortunately this is not a restaurant that I would recommend."}
{"text":"We had a nice brunch here. Mmm, beignets. Beautiful interior. Everyone was satisfied with their meal (eggs Benedict, po boy, trout salad)."}
{"text":"Like most on yelp I really wanted to like this place..food is super bland,staff super rude.what a waste of historical space.something good awesome and delicious needs to be here!"}
{"text":"It is a sad moment to say the food was awesome but the service. Not so much. We sat at the bar and was never more dissatisfied. I felt we were an inconvenience to the bartender. 2/3/2015 at 5 pm. Come on be bright and brilliant. If you don't like your job go somewhere else. I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Unbelievable, yummy, and wow!  What a great place! The establishment is perfect for day or night. During the day it is light and airy. Their menu is very Southern and will melt in your mouth. The best"}
{"text":"First off, the food is excellent.  Fried Green Tomatoes are delicious, and everything was very good or better.    HOWEVER, I have to give the service an \"F\", and not because of our waitress, but an odd policy that made our experience there downright angering.  We had a large party of 15 for which we made a reservation in advance.  Upon asking to split the check, we were told by our waitress that restaurant policy was to not allow split checks, but they would accept multiple credit cards to pay the final tab.  I expressed my concern over this, given that figuring out the bill for 15 people would be a huge task.  I asked for clarification on that rule, which I never got.  Our waitress would only tell us it was the policy and she could do nothing about it.  Sure enough, when the bill came, mass confusion began.  We had a $600 tab that we had to figure out amongst ourselves.  First submission of cards proved that the total came up short, despite our math that put us at just above the total.  The waitress was frustrated with the confusion, and she asked if I would like to speak to the manager to figure this out.  I said yes, but she returned shortly to tell me that her manager just said \"that's restaurant policy\".   After over 30 minutes of trying to work amongst ourselves and with our waitress, we finally got it settled.  During all this confusion and frustration, the manager looked on and said nothing, and refused to address the issue for both his customers and his waitress.  Why would a restaurant defer this sort of problem to his customers to figure out for themselves?  Our waitress suggested this was time saving for the staff.  Clearly this did nothing but cause problems for everyone involved.  She was perhaps more frustrated than we the customers were, and the manager left her high and dry to deal with it herself.  That is poor customer service.   It was enough to leave us with a bad experience at Southern Rail.  Sure, the food was good, but that doesn't matter if the \"policy makers\"  make policies that hurts its customers, and then gives no explanation as to their policy.    I will think twice before considering dining at Southern Rail again.  If you are going with a party, take into consideration that at the end of your meal, you are going to be tasked with figuring out how to divide your bill."}
{"text":"I had a great first visit!  I had a good sandwich but the star of the show was the banana pudding. They use ginger snaps instead of vanilla wafers and it took it to the next level!  Loved it, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Shockingly low quality of food with a correspondingly shockingly high price. With great expectations my husband and I went there Friday night at 6 o'clock.  The gumbo was a joke!  It was shredded chicken in brown water from a crock pot with some Cajun seasoning, no gravy, no okra, no seafood, with a tablespoon of dry crunchy rice on top.  So disappointing that I did not think I would recover, but then my cornbread salad came and the experience reached further into the abyss.  I don't even know what to say about this disaster!  Small, shriveled cauliflower, three lettuce leaves, shriveled and pickled cherry tomatoes, and chunks of day old corn muffins mixed in dressing that was neither tasty or salad saving.  I returned the salad uneaten and was billed full price even after telling the waiter that is was really quite bad.  Never will we go to this place again."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant! I've been twice in the last week and can't wait to come back. Fried green tomatoes are great, the pimento cheese that comes with is so good I could eat it by itself! First I had the cider brined pork loin, served with whipped sweet potatoes and collard greens. I found this dish to be best when all three elements are eaten together rather than separately. For dessert I had the bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top. This is basically a thick piece of French toast with bourbon caramel sauce, all plates were cleaned.   Second visit I had the fried okra (along with fried green tomatoes) and the blackened flat iron steak. This steak is a nice thick cut served with buttered succotash and marble potatoes. This is an amazing dish with great flavors and was perfectly cooked by the chef.   As for the building itself, I love the way it was remodeled and decorated (outside you can still see the original Beef Eaters stained concrete). The patio is comfortable, large, and has a nice fireplace.   I cannot wait to come back to try the fried chicken, meatloaf, catfish cioppino and the duck.  **UPDATE**  I have now had a chance to try the cioppino and the fried chicken. The cioppino was great, the catfish was cooked well with a nice corn meal breading. The cioppino was thicker, not too soupy, with large chunks of deep red tomatoes with a nice amount of acidity.   The fried chicken was great, the breading was thicker and was a little over-cooked but I will definitely be ordering it again."}
{"text":"Good news - bad news.  The good news is that all of the appetizers were very good.  Red beans & rice, corn soup, dirty rice balls and corn muffins.  We got there during 'social' hour and appetizers were half off, so we went a little overboard!  My wife also enjoyed the cauliflower/broccoli casserole she had as an entree.  The bad news is the reason we drove 40 miles was the southern fried chicken, which was a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.  We had heard and read that the southern fried chicken here was a must...but instead it was a bust.  Over-cooked and over-priced at $22.  I've never seen such small pieces of chicken,,,especially the breast, which must have been all of 4 bites.  I prefer white meat but there wasn't much between the miniature-sized wing and the mini-breast.  I agree with Will T's review of 7/17 and would not recommend going out of your way for this place and we won't be going back at all.  To the kitchen @ Southern Rail:  You're charging full-price, why don't you serve full-size pieces of chicken?  The miniature pieces you served Saturday night were embarrassing to your establishment and to the name 'Southern'."}
{"text":"Second visit.  This isn't a Southern Food Experience!  The red beans and rice was bland with what tasted like canned beans.  The gumbo wasn't any better.  The salad we ordered was just OK.  Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Went back since the first time had the gumbo, it was lacking seasoning almost like Campbell soup version of gumbo.  The drinks and the sandwich I had were  great.  I hope  the gumbo gets back to southern standard  right now it takes like nursing home gumbo."}
{"text":"Ouch. The gumbo sucked. They could not make a decent roux base. We didn't try anything else due to this basic failure."}
{"text":"We were a party of 6, and we began our evening with fried okra, fried green tomatoes, and cauliflower.  They were all delicious.  3 in the party had the fried chicken and they all loved it.  Another had the pork loin, and it was very good.  I had the flatiron steak, and it was wonderful. Tried the banana pudding (good) bread pudding (not my favorite) and a chocolate torte (everybodys favorite).  We could not have handled another bite.  We want to try the Sunday brunch.  All and all... very good and satisfying.   Good attentive service."}
{"text":"Good food. Outrageous prices. 13$ for the cheapest glass of wine. The ingredients used are low quality but with a fancy twist . The environment and service is great but we left feeling very ripped off. My wife had a flat iron steak which was low quality meat but they charged us 27$!! Which is basically the price of a filet mignon I'm some places. I had shrimp with the head on. 6 shrimps,(medium size) 20$!!!"}
{"text":"Driving past decided to stop. Fried chicken was moist and delicious. Lots of local wines and beers."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back.   My friend took me there for lunch yesterday and it was terrific! I had the catfish ph boy - mmmm.  Beans and rice were great as well."}
{"text":"I wanted to share my SUPREME disappointment with my visit to Southern Rail restaurant last night.  I had been excited to visit since I first heard of the Newton project and another Justin Beckett restaurant in Phoenix, as my husband and I love Beckett's Table.  We have two young children, and it's not very often we get a date night out to enjoy a dinner just the two of us.  When the opportunity presented itself yesterday, we were so excited to try out Southern Rail.  Great wine list--featuring one of our all-time favorite wines (The Franc)--great menu...it was idyllic.    We decided to start with sharing a gumbo appetizer while we figured out what our actual meal would be.  It arrived quickly, which was nice, but I have never been as disappointed in a dish served to me at a restaurant as I was with that gumbo. I presume Chef Beckett knows what a roux is, but this gumbo was completely lacking a roux as its base.  This gumbo tasted like brown water with some chunks of chicken and sausage thrown into it with a scoop of rice.  My husband grew up in New Orleans, and his Cajun aunt taught me how to make a proper roux and gumbo.  If I order gumbo at a restaurant, I expect it to be better than what I can make at home (which is pretty tasty if I do say so myself) or at the very least to have a decent roux, and to say this gumbo was disappointing doesn't even scratch the surface.  We sent the gumbo back (I have never before sent back a dish), finished our wine, and left.  It wasn't worth even trying anything else on the menu, wasting precious date night time or money!    I really hope this was just some kind of weird fluke and that the entire menu isn't as completely lackluster as the gumbo, but I won't be back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"I brought my Daughter here for her Birthday Lunch. We had been wanting to try it.  So this is where she chose. Parking is very busy, as there are several businesses here. There is lots of parking ,you just have to search! We were greeted by a very nice young man when we came in, & we were seated on the patio. I had told the Host,  it was my daughters Birthday and did they do any thing for Birthdays. He said yes, absolutely .  We did see one person get a little Birthday treat. However, it took us so long to even get our check and such here that we never had time to get her Birthday treat. (She had to go to work) ,Which yes I told him. Our server was the Bartender and in all fairness , he was Very Busy. We were seated at a table. So I know it is hard to wait on tables ,when they are making drinks for all the servers & making drinks and food orders at the bar as well. I think we should of had a server, no the Bartender.  Anyway, the place is nice. Decorated very well. We sat on the patio which is not too close to the street. So that is good. It is not like you are eating in the parking lot ,like some places. We had an appetizer of Green fired Tomatoes, which came with a side of spicy cream cheese. That was the best I have ever had. I hope they do not change that. sometimes places are good and then they change the way they cook things. Anyway, that is a winner. I  got a grilled Watermelon Salad ,which was good. My daughter got The Roast Beef Poorboy which was Ohh La laaa! It came with a side of Gumbo. Also very good.  I was drinking hot green tea, one thing there, you need a plate to out the Tea Bag on. I know it is an American Thing to drink Tea with the Bag in the Cup. But, no thank you not for me. That is about the only thing I would change. Water on the table ,very good.  Of course the Bartender got busy as Lunch got busier, so then we had to wait for to go boxes ,the check, etc. No Birthday treat. Our time there 1 and half hours. So it is not like we were there for 30 min lunch rush. I would go back, I did like it. The food was very good. The Rest rooms are a little different. They are clean and nice, but they are one person at a time, and the locks are strange, so no one seems to be able to lock them properly. So in return, lots of opened doors while people are using them. Just a small thing, but just saying.  I will go back and give it another try."}
{"text":"FABULOUS! Great ambiance. Great food. (oooh....fried green tomatoes!) Great service. We went for Valentine's and had a wonderful evening. We went with another couple and cleaned our plates! We'll go back. Diana K."}
{"text":"I don't usually write poor reviews.  This place is a waste of time, money, and energy to get there.  After our table not being ready at time for our reservation, we sat down.  Then we waited 10 mins to get the server to bring us water.  Another 10 mins for cocktails, and wow, we finally get to order!.  We got the cornbread salad and the chicken and biscuit dumplings.  Salad was good, chicken not so much.  Especially after waited 10 mins after our entree was served to get the wine.  To dessert, the French toast was very good.  Only issue, is that it was supposed to be bread pudding and $8 for one piece of French toast, they must be making some great margins!"}
{"text":"My opinion on Southern Rail has nothing to do with my dining experience it has EVERYTHING to do with professionalism. I applied for a serving position in late September and went through two interviews. The first one was with Casey, the second one was with Ty, I believe that's his name. Following my second interview I was offered the job. Casey and I had scheduled my start date for the following Monday. With excitement I purchased my uniform and was ready to start. When Monday came Casey called to inform me that there was a scheduling conflict and the person who was going to train me couldn't start until the following week. I was very understanding because I know life happens and things come up. He asked if I'd be able to start the following week. I wasn't sure because while he canceled on my training I found another job and so I gave him a call back with my updated schedule. We picked a new start date. The Monday my new schedule started I received another call from Casey 15 minutes before my shift started saying that the person who was supposed to train me couldn't come in and he didn't trust the rest of his staff to train me. I said that was fine, but I was pretty frustrated considering this was the second time. I decided to call back and asked him to call me when he knew someone was available to train me. Two weeks went by and i didn't hear from him. On the third week I called and he was busy and never got back to me. I called this morning and he told me they had internal changes and a bunch of other things. I told him that I saw the recent craigslist ad looking for servers. He said some other excuses and the said we should move forward and go our separate ways. I told him I couldn't agree more. I feel like my time was wasted."}
{"text":"I am a Southerner, born and raised in the Carolinas, so maybe my standards are too high, but this place was such a disappointment.    I sat at the bar and my bartender/waiter was so absent minded.  He took my order, then 20 minutes later came back to me and said \"are you not having anything to eat?\"  I said \"I thought I already ordered.\"  He had an \"oh shit\" moment and ran back to the kitchen to put in the order.  When it finally came out, he had forgotten to put in the appetizer I ordered.    The fried chicken was a mess.  The batter fell off the meat which is NOT normal.  Another bartender asked me for feedback to share with the kitchen and I explained that batter should stay on the chicken.  Apparently they are going to throw out that batch.  Good decision!  Fortunately, the collards and my cocktail were good but they couldn't make up for all the problems with the meal.  I appreciated that they comped my cocktail...it was a nice gesture."}
{"text":"The food and ambiance were both decent at best. Food was extremely bland. Only upside was the server seemed to be quite knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for or anniversary and were a bit disappointed.  Our waiter (I think it was John? Something with a J) was great. Friendly, attentive without being overbearing, and gave good recommendations.  We got the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer at his suggestion, and they were delicious. They come with a spicy pimiento cheese that really makes it.   The entrees were what knocks this down to 3 stars. I got the gumbo, my husband got the shrimp. The gumbo was watery and tasted burnt. It had very little flavor so I had to pour a good amount of salt just to taste something (besides burn). The shrimp came in a cream sauce that was overly sweet because it had not been cooked down enough. The weak-flavored gumbo and the sweet shrimp sauce made me think that neither had been cooked long enough. Neither of the entrees were bad enough to send back, but considering the reputation of the chefs and the prices, I was expecting a whole lot more. And if you're a southern restaurant you should know how to make gumbo.   The other bright spot (another rec from our waiter) was the dessert - we got the pie of the day which was some insane chocolate  almond mousse. If it weren't a rotating special I would go back specifically for the dessert.   I would not recommend this place for dinner. I had a similar experience at Beckett's Table, interestingly enough - great appetizers and desserts but very underwhelming entrees. But I would go for a drink and a snack - it's a pretty place and the service is good."}
{"text":"Pretty great location.  I loved that they're next to a book store!  Wait staff was friendly and water was kept full via a glass bottle on the table they kept full.  The decor inside is very nicely done, all wood and Americana, but as others have noted, it is extremely loud...and it wasn't even crowded when we went during a rain storm!  (Note that there was also quite a bit of parking because of said storm...)  I had the smoked chicken and grilled andouille gumbo with rice.  It was tasty, not too spicy, and more of a soup or chili consistency than a chunkier jumbalaya type consistency.  I admit I had to save the giant sausage on top of it for leftovers, and felt it was overkill and a bit one-note.  There was definitely NOT enough rice for me, but that's probably because of my Hawaiian background which requires copious rice with chili and soup.  I'd want at least double the portion of rice, and maybe half the amount of gumbo, with a piece of fried chicken or something to go along with it (blame the background again for wanting a \"mixed plate\").  Next time I would order the \"small plate\" size of this (and probably still want extra rice).  I haven't been back yet, but I would consider it if I am looking for heavier, heartier, upscale Southern-ish food.  The prices are quite high (the gumbo was $17), so I don't see this as a place I would dine at by myself."}
{"text":"I finally had the fried chicken and it was hit and spicy. I loved it and the coating was crunchy and well seasoned. The bread pudding is as good as it gets too!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best fried chicken I've ever had and I've had my fair share of fried chicken. We went on a week night and didn't have to wait. The service was great and the food was really good. It satisfied my hunger for good southern food. Definitely a place to try. I'd suggest the macaroni and the fried green tomatoes."}
{"text":"These are the kind of reviews I don't like to write because I didn't get to eat the food so this is strictly service it started off great I walked in sat the bar and what I would assume was the manager came over right away gave me a menu and gave me a glass of water few minutes later the bartender and came up and that's where it down hill that's what else I like to drink I said water is fine and give me a dirty ass look and and made grunting noise and in a very rude tone asked if I was ready to order I said no give me a few minutes he walked away and then I literally sat there for it 15 minutes waiting for someone to come back no one ever came back so being I only have an hour for lunch takes me 10 minutes to drive there 10 minutes to drive back so now I had no more lunch time had to go back to work without eating because this guy got mad I'm sure because I didn't order anything else to drink to raise my bar tab Celeste hit for him he would assume may give it another try cuz I went there for their Fried Chicken but they only do it after 5 no big deal definitely won't sit in the bar again or go at lunch time"}
{"text":"After having great experiences at Becketts Table my wife and I were looking forward to Southern Rail, she loves southern style cooking and I've really enjoyed Becketts so it seemed like a \"can't miss\", unfortunately it really was off target, by a lot.  Positive notes:  the waiter was good, we both had the feeling that they grabbed some of the great staff from Beckets and brought them over, by the end of supper I felt bad for the guy, I think he knew the place was not up to snuff.  Which made it kind of feel sad, the waiter was superb, he really was, but the dishes just plain were not. Oh, the Apple butter is just like Becketts so that is a big plus.  Negatives:  I had the salmon, the first bite was kind of a surprise, super crispy outside, kind of raw/ soft center, at first I was a little put off but figured hey it's good.  That did not last though the fish got progressively less cooked and ended up being kind of rubbery/uncooked.  I just want to say I like raw fish, but undercooked is very different from raw, and when part of a filet is cooked the rest ought to be as well.  My wife had the chicken and dumplings, it was inedible.  As for drinks, forgettable.  Long story short, southern rail you've got a ways to go.  We really like Becketts, it's a no contest sort of play here."}
{"text":"Had a lot of food at Southern Rail! Our appetizers were great: avocado toast, deviled eggs (kinda random-love it!), and the fried rice balls. As entrees, we ordered mac and cheese (which had mustard-that's different and yummy) along with the chicken and dumplings. Must admit, was disappointed by the chicken and dumplings--broth was bland and the whole dish just looked like the ingredients were plopped into a liquidy bowl. Still, everything else was good and our waitress was super personable!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here for a Saturday afternoon. I had never been, was pleasantly surprised. The ambiance is awesome! The service was great! The food...amazing! We had the fried green tomatoes, the pimento cheese relish was delish! The rice balls, deviled eggs, cornbread muffins and red beans and rice food not disappoint! Great mule! All in all great experience!! Will be back for the fried chicken!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous!  Food should not be this great.  From start to finish with Chris as our guide.  If you have not eaten here, get in your car and go!"}
{"text":"Great location for some yummy food and nice happy hour! Stopped in for some great $5 wines and fried green tomatoes! All wines are US born and great selections! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  We loved brunch and can't wait to return for dinner!    Tried the grilled watermelon salad with pecan chimichurri, peaches and sweet pea tendrils on top!  I added smoked chicken and had never tasted better smoked chicken. Yum!  We also ordered the BLT salad with cola BBQ drizzle and charred green onions.   Excellent ambiance, with even original Beefeaters chandeliers!  Adorable!  Job well done....we will be back again & again & again!!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We were really looking forward to trying this place, but nothing we ordered was very good. Service was terrible too. We were sat at seats that had 2 empty wine glasses there. After about 5 mins someone came over and asked if we wanted refills on the wine. After we explained that they weren't our glasses and no one had cleared the table yet it took another 5-10 min for anytime to come take our drink order. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely superb!! I attended with a party of 10 and the server was kind and very sufficient in making sure our food was served hot in a timely matter! I ordered the pork loin with collard greens and sweet potatoes. It was delicious!! We also had the opportunity to taste all of the desserts on the menu and all of them were little tastes of heaven. Great place, great atmosphere and great food!!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday around 3:00.     Not crowded.    Tried the Fried green tomatoes poor boy.   Great flavor.   A bit messy to eat.    Did not like the gumbo.   Lemonade very good.   Home made.   Good service."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious!!!  Service, however, was VERY inattentive.  We went around 8pm on a Tuesday... Not busy at all, so it's perplexing on why our waiter was never to be found.  Lots of new restaurants opening up in the north central corridor, this place would be wise to establish a high level of expected hospitality among their employees if they plan on competing and staying in business."}
{"text":"We have driven past this place countless times, and with Central being closed and is being unable to get to Windsor we figured it was fate.   Long story short, the food was alright but the service was lacking. Our server was MIA and flighty, dropping dirty silverware on my dad multiple times. Also, after waiting an obscene amount of time for the beignets, the manager finally dropped them off at the table spilling powder sugar all over my black suit and didn't apologize   Since it was a Saturday afternoon we figured that the food would come quickly, but we waited over an hour for our food.   The food was decent and we would've given it a second chance if our server would've cared about our dining experience."}
{"text":"Food and ambience are excellent, Opaka Red Snapper very tasty.  Gumbo YaYa is to die for.  Just the right amount of spice and huge chunks of hickory smoked chicken. We're definitely coming back with friends."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to go to Southern Rail for a while but we like to give a restaurant time to get on it's feet so to speak.  It has been open for a while now so we made reservations for 7:30 - Saturday for 6 of us.  All of us were excited.    We got there and it was painfully apparent we really didn't need a reservation.  We were one of 5-6 tables with between 20-30 open tables (inside and out) - on a Saturday at 7:30.  The people who were there seemed to be enjoying themselves.  The space is fun - if a bit on the Kitsch-y side.  The staff were... good... but they did not seem happy to be there.  No one smiled.  They seemed rushed without reason.    From the food perspective the salads were nice.  But unfortunately that is pretty much the best part of the meal.  I had the pork chop - the pork chop itself was good but the goopy mash of wilted greens and orange glop the pork chop was sitting in was less than appealing.  Our friends had apps for dinner, nothing remarkable nor memorable.  The bill however was remarkable and not in a good way.  It is a shame.  I like Becket's table (which needs a refresh on the menu as it is getting quite stale this far along).  I like Southern food in general.  Unfortunately Southern Rail was just so so and pretty expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed brunch at Southern Rail this past weekend in celebration of Father's Day. The Hubs and I (and baby-to-be) booked brunch at Southern Rail because we absolutely love Beckett's Table and had to give their sister restaurant a try. Loved the decor of this spot, open and very \"garage\" chic feeling. It seemed industrial, but quaint. Service was OK, not bad, but not great.  The food was delish... I had the honey lemonade, which I thought was very refreshing and the Hubs had some drink with milk in the name. He really liked it, said it almost tasted like a banana smoothie without the banana. We started with the beignets, which were hot, fresh, fluffy, and covered in powdered sugar... so. good. I had the fried green tomato benedict, which was so tasty and interesting. It was surprisingly sweet thanks to the tomato jam. I could have done without the frisee salad though. The Hubs had the savory dutch pancake special. It wasn't what we expected, but it was really good. Basically, it was like a skillet breakfast on top of a savory, egg pancake. He enjoyed it, but liked mine better (as did I).  Based on this visit, we are super excited to come back and try dinner!"}
{"text":"Came here with two of my girlfriends tonight, and honestly I can't even express how delicious the food was. Our server Chris was beyond amazing, and  had great recommendations for drinks and food. We met one of the owners Michelle, and felt the need to let her know about our amazing service. I will definitely be coming back! And side note: the fried green tomatoes are my favorite! In conclusion, Chris is the best and the food is bomb."}
{"text":"This place absolutely SUCKS!  It's super expensive for crappy food. The bartender doesn't know how to make a whiskey sour. The server I had was named buddy and he was crap too. Such an expensive place and they still hand you a to go box instead of doing it themselves. Real classy. What a horrible redone place. Beef eatery atleast was good."}
{"text":"This place was the best place I've been to in a long time. The cheeseburger and fried chicken were amazing ! I've been craving their cheeseburger and home made pickles for a month now, but haven't had time to go back."}
{"text":"We came for the first time for my mother's birthday. We made a reservation ahead of time just in case. The girl I spoke to was very pleasant. It is very chic and modern and a modern version of the South. Kim was our serving and she was very nice, made us feel welcome, and answered any questions we had. Even the staff around us that took plate and presented our food were really nice.   The food was equally as impressive.  I had the Southern Fried Chicken, which was the best fried chicken I have ever had, especially in AZ. My mom had the Chicken and Dumplings, which had smoked chicken with a wonderful added smoky flavor. My dad didn't have a single bite of his Salmon left and my brother ate all of the Southern Fried Chicken he ordered. He loved the Yukon Gold Mash and the Corn on the Cobb that came with the Southern Fried Chicken. We also ordered the Beignets. Light, fluffy, warm pillows dusted with powdered sugar. The lightest doughnut like pastry I've ever had. No sauce required, super moist on the inside.   We left stuffed and extremely happy with our time at Southern Rail.   We left stuffed"}
{"text":"Great southern style food and an incredible outdoor seating area and atmosphere.   The overall area was also nice, we then went to the Southern Gardner and book store in the same building after brunch."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this chic hip Jazzy Joint and LOVED EVERY THING ABOUT IT!! Live Jazz cold beer great food!!!!! Staff was friendly my glass was never empty food was good and the MUSIC WAS GREAT!!!!!"}
{"text":"I only like a few dishes from here as I am pretty picky but the dishes I do like are so good! They have ah-mazing fried chicken, although the last time I went and got it, it was burned a little on one piece. I don't recall whether it was a bit dry or not because I prefer the juicier dark meat part of the chicken, and maybe I can choose dark meat next time, as I think white meat is more dry and tasteless. I was craving honey over my fried chicken (not pregnant lol-something another restaurant does really well) and the waiter was able to give me a small cup of it on the side to drizzle over my fried chicken. Im glad that I am able to substitute sides, as i am not a fan of collard greens. Their beignets are to die for, especially dipped in honey! Great to go to brunch and have them with coffee sometime."}
{"text":"So I've purposely waited for this joint to work out the kinks but had a late birthday brunch yesterday with a couple of the besties.  First of all, the place is adorable.  I am so glad to see the care and respect for history taken into account as part of it's restoration.  The outside seating really needs some sound dampening, though.  The menu is interesting, but limited.  Two of us shared a side of fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese and banana bread French toast.  Our other buddy had a salad and fried green tomatoes.  We were told that ONLY brunch is served on the weekends.  Adding more side/stand alone selections will give diners more choices and help repeat business.  We usually have a cocktail or two but were told there were no drink specials  at brunch. $14 for a glass of wine is absolutely prohibitive to our group and, I suspect, to many others.  This area is PACKED with great brunch places that recognize the importance of affordable drinks and their impact on repeat business. (See: Windsor and Switch)  Our waitress was nice but not visible very often.  Our interaction with other staff was completely nonexistent.  No welcome, no eye contact, no hello, even when I initiated it.  I said hello to the manager (?) as we were leaving and got nothing in return.  I suspect the loudness of the patio interfered with his hearing.  I got nothing from the inside staff either.  Complete crickets.  This is a HUGE coaching opportunity and it costs NOTHING to implement!  To sum it up:  the food is interesting but not enough to bring me back. The value of my dining experience has to include comfort , feeling appreciated, and affordability.  I didn't get that at Southern Rail and won't be returning unless things improve dramatically.  It's too bad, I realllllly wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and good service.  Awesome take on southern classics and stepping them up."}
{"text":"Our first time here for our anniversary was great! We used yelp to make a reservation and had zero wait time. The service was great! We started with the cornbread which was good. My husband ordered the steak and it was amazing! The best steak we may have ever had. Neither of us has ever had a steak cooked so perfect. The entire piece of meat was medium, no over cooked edges, it was juicy and perfectly flavored and amazing. I had the salmon special and it was great. We had the coconut cake for dessert and it was light and delicious with this amazing sauce stuff on the side. Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Visited Sunday, August 13th. Being raised on good southern cooking this restaurant was on my list to visit. I'm sorry to say it was just \"ok.\" Started with the fried okra...was very chewy, and didn't seem freshly made. I've eaten a lot of fried okra in my day, and my grandma and mother would not have been pleased with it either. Main course my husband and I shared fried chicken, again \"ok.\"  The atmosphere was very nice, but with food being just \"ok\" I really doubt we'll come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight for dinner before the crowd came in. Our Server John did a great job of explaining everything and handling our requests. Other staff members were tentative cleaning our plates and getting us setup for the next round.   I've seen lots of complaints about their service, but stopped in anyway to see what its all about, no big complaints at all on my end.  We ordered the Kale Salad, Mac & Cheese, Fried Green Tomatoes, Corn Bread, and some beer.  In all the food was good, portion to price ratio is a bit off in my opinion, but all other areas were good.  I'll stop in for lunch next month to try a PO' Boy and see how that goes."}
{"text":"Brunch today at the \"Rail.\" Croque Madame for two with Bloody Mary's. Food was excellent. Service was excellent. Atmosphere was good. This is a place we will come back to. The menu is like being back in Charleston, SC."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar as it was a beautiful day outside today.  If the service had been even close to adequate I would have easily given this place a better rating.  The appetizers and drinks were great.  At no time during our visit (3 cocktails each and a few appetizers) did our server ask us ONCE if we would like another drink or how our food was.  Completely disappointing service!"}
{"text":"Southern rail used to be a great place to go, good southern food and fast service. Now the service and food has really gone down hill. I think they have a bad manager. Sad to see the decline. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Loved my experience at Southern Rail!  The service is amazing and the food was fantastic.  We went opening weekend and they were still working out some kinks and the food was still amazing!  Love the menu options.  Great for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.  The atmosphere is great!  I had the gumbo which was delicious.  I have been waiting for some good gumbo here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Don't let them seat you outside if you want to hear anyone else at the table.  Monday lunch and they asked us to wait 20-25 minutes (turned out to be less) to seat a group of 6.  Have to agree with another reviewer that things were a bit pricey.  I ordered the cornbread salad which was great except that for the price, I thought it could have filled more of the plate -- definitely on the stingy side.  The dirty rice croquettes were excellent also.  But it annoyed the heck out of me that when I asked what the little green things were in my corn bread salad (the menu was long gone by the time we finally got our lunch), the server said he'd have to ask the kitchen and then came back to say they were seared green onions.  I couldn't decide if he was deliberately insulting my intelligence or if the kitchen had set him up.  No resemblance to green onion, which is not surprising since it was actually okra.  Hope he was the newbie because he didn't seem to know enough about the menu when we were ordering either.  2 people had the butternut squash soup and told me mine was far superior.  Glad I didn't order the shrimp po-boy based on the one the came out for another person at the table.  Summary:  Food interesting but overpriced.  Not sure I'll go back."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood of the Newton--and have anxiously awaited the opening of all the components.  Had dinner with a friend last night and we did all the recommended dishes:  fried green tomatoes, watermelon salad, and the duck and coconut cake for dessert.  I thought all the food was pretty good.  I was a little disappointed about not being able to taste/find the sausage that was in the rice that came with the duck--it would have added a nice little spice.  The coconut cake was terrific and a nice ending to the meal.  The reason for the three are things with a little work could be fixed: 1. The restaurant is noisy--I think there is a trend that somehow the noise is supposed to be an indicator of coolness--it is a decision that restaurants have to make--it is loud but wasn't intolerable. 2.  The service was just off--sometimes very attentive and sometimes a desert.  If you are going to suggest splitting a dish that has rice--then by all means bring a spoon out so one doesn't have to transfer the rice from one plate to another grain by grain with a knife and a fork--Obviously we would have asked for a spoon had the waiter not been in the desert mode at the time. 3.  Again if people are splitting plates--have the good sense to bring out clean small plates between courses--they were not offered and we could not ask because again we were in the waiter desert at the moment we needed them.   4.  In my mind, unless specifically requested, an appetizer and a salad are two different courses and should be served separately so there is time to enjoy them. 5.  We had a little bit of the pimento spread left over from the tomatoes and asked from some bread.  What we got was something that was spongy and white on the inside and had barely a crust on the outside--I would certainly not call it bread.  A restaurant at this level has no excuse for serving yucky bread--if you are going to serve it should be able to stand on its own as well as being a complement to whatever it is going with.  A great tasty rye would have been wonderful for the left over pimento or even a robust baguette, but certainly not what we got.   Southern Rail--I really want you to get to your act together --you are such a welcome addition to the neighborhood--It won't take much--but you have to start paying attention to the details.  Our little corner of the world is pretty competitive--I can just as easily walk east or west as walk south--Please step up your game so I want to head south on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Pros: The atmosphere is just gorgeous. Mostly reclaimed materials, much of which is from the old Beefeaters restaurant. Beautiful design; I just sat there looking around the room. Also, the staff is excellent. Everyone I spoke with--the host/hostess, bartender, server--they all were totally professional and totally friendly at the same time. Really great group of people.  Cons: The food is overpriced. I live in this neighborhood but feel excluded from being able to eat here more than once or twice a year because of the high cost. It's obvious that most diners are not from the neighborhood (you can just tell; look at their cars and clothes), which is a bummer since it would be nice to have a local spot that served people IN the neighborhood. I also wasn't that impressed by the food, as I expected to be. I had the fried chicken and pork loin (split with my husband). If you're looking for fancy fried chicken, Tuck Shop is better; trust me on that one. The pork loin was good but not worth $24 at all. The mashed sweet potatoes that surrounded it were so, so rich and buttery--and I LOVE butter--but it was just too much; it kind of made me feel sick.   I personally prefer to spend less money and have the same or even better quality food at other nearby spots like Gallo Blanco, Thai Rama, etc. (I know those aren't the same cuisine, but just when it comes to judging the value for the money.)  I'll probably come back here when my husband's parents come into town since they're fancy and they'll likely pay for our meal, but otherwise I unfortunately can't afford to spend as much time here as I'd like!"}
{"text":"Came here here with a large group of friends for a birthday.  We were seated promptly and immediately our server was there to explain menu and take drink orders.  The gin jar was the popular drink for the table and it was a good refreshing cocktail.  My Sazerac was spot on.  We ordered a bunch of apps for the table.  Fried okra was good for fried okra, maybe a touch more seasoning in the  breeding.  Fried green tomatoes were good.  Again maybe a tad underseasoned on the reading but you didn't notice if you ate the dish as intended which is with amazingly good, punch you the mouth with flavor pimento cheese.  Mmmmm.  The roasted cauliflower was not exactly southern comfort food like everything else on the menu but was an inspired dish.  The mix of apples, roasted cauliflower, charred onions, and a pesto and smoked tomato sauce was creative and actually worked well all together.  Everyone's main course disappeared and everyone said it was delicious.  The star of the table was definitely the fried chicken. Seasoned just enough breading, perfectly crispy and amazingly tender and juicy chicken.  And you get a whole half a chicken with an order.  So good!!!   All of the deserts were amazing too.  The bourbon sauce on the bread pudding was to die for and the beignets...SPOT ON!  Only thing that would make it better would be a cup of chicory coffee!  Overall had a great night with good food and good friends!"}
{"text":"Brioche rolls with apple butter make a great start.  The fried chicken and gumbo (add shrimp) are a must.  Save room for dessert- the bread pudding is delicious.  The atmosphere is good and service both times we've been was excellent.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"So happy to have found a truly wonderful spot to enjoy dinner/drinks in central Phoenix!  We have been raving about it to everyone!  Location is convenient, across the street from the Central//Camelback light rail station. Menu is anything but boring; the difficulty is in deciding what to order when everything sounds so scrumptious.  I was so pleased with their dinner menu, I opted for the Sunday brunch last week because the menu is different. I'm not gonna lie...the house made honey lemonade was perfection."}
{"text":"This place is extremely hit or really miss. I've given it 3 chances. I had a good experience the first time I visited, but it had just opened, so maybe they were pulling out all of the stops. From that point on the food has been less than average. Ordered fried chicken and it was raw. Sent it back and when it came back it was still raw and they tried to convinced me that it was just braised. I know pink fleshy chicken when I see it. We had a few other dishes, but I'm actually from the south and I'd take my grandmothers fried chicken and collards any day. Everything is just ok. They have a couple of things on the menu that are ok, but overall I am not a fan when my friends suggest we meet there for dinner. Always feels like a waste of money. I want to give it 2 stars but I'd feel mean. Lol"}
{"text":"This was a nice looking place , great customer service , wonderful appearance . The menu was pretty much soul food mocked in a way . It was our first time trying after passing by one night . Sad to say , the food was so terrible we couldn't finish it , packed up & left after paying for a 60 buck horrific meal . We ordered gumbo . The sausage came as whole , it was burnt & it was shredded chicken (no no !!) the corn bread muffins had no taste and now the next morning I'm waking up with a upset stomach & very disappointed . We will not return nor recommend this place for food ."}
{"text":"Overpriced nonsense. I was almost willing to take the plunge and order the fried green tomato po boy for $11...until I realized that was just for the lunch menu. The dinner menu is completely overpriced with a fairly uninteresting selection of food. We ordered a couple of appetizers and a few drinks. Okra was over cooked and flavorless, my friend enjoyed the dirty rice balls though. Our waiter seemed annoyed that we weren't ordering more food or drinks. After I told him we were only getting the appetizers he said \"should I take these menus off of the table then?\" but not in a nice way really. However you do your job, man. If we don't need to order anything else, guess that makes sense, right? He continues to pester us about ordering more food and drinks after we made it clear we weren't interested from the start. Try fairer prices and better quality food and then maybe you won't have to work so hard to get people interested in it."}
{"text":"The food is good but I was surprised service was a bit slow with how empty the restaurant was when we went in (Sunday night of a holiday weekend). The drinks took a while and we also waited a long time to finally flag down our server to place our dinner order. I ordered the organic Scottish salmon and the salmon was juicy with great flavor but the spinach was a little bland and the entire dish had too much water in it (see photo).   On the positive side, the grilled cauliflower appetizer was cooked perfectly and the two different sauces had a lot of great flavor and the red one had some spice. Definitely would order that again. Our group also shared two desserts, the beignets and some sort of cake and they both were fantastic! Definitely the best part of the meal!  I would possibly try this place again but only for happy hour."}
{"text":"I do not normally write negative reviews, but I was seriously disappointed in the dining experience.  I was there on Friday, April 13.  The restaurant was not busy. I was going to eat at the restaurant but decided to take my food home instead. I ordered the Fried Chicken since I had read a good review of it and was interested in trying it.  When I arrived home I open the box and found that the chicken was heavily overcooked to the point where it appeared black underneath the breading it was dry and less than palatable.   I was very sad considering what good reviews they had received.   I doubt I will go back again."}
{"text":"I live just around the corner i came yesterday & loved it we came when they first opened & it was rsvp only.  I thought  over priced for the amount of food decided to give another shot back 2day GREAT LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Went in the other night for the first time with some friends. We did everything family style and shared. Perfect way to try several things. The grits were AWESOME! Asked for them to throw a couple shrimps on top which made it even better. Tried the gumbo, fried green tomatoes (first time) and the dirty rice crockets. All were superb. Opted for the ribs (just ok), pork chop (highlight of the meal) and the catfish (tasty and light). All the sides were tasty and full of flavor. Tried collard greens for the first time, cooked to perfection. Wine list was extensive and offered many local AZ selections which is great. Neat rustic atmosphere with a elegant twist. Would be an awesome date spot. :)"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. The atmosphere is cool, the patio is great!  The food is awesome! We came with a large group and the service was phenomenal. Looking forward to coming back and trying the smoked trout appetizer along with some other dishes.  The food was fresh and if this menu doesnt do it for you then try the sister restaurant Becketts Table, also amazing!"}
{"text":"Looking for a new happy hour spot where you end up staying for dinner?  Southern Rail just might be what you are looking for.  We met here with a small group of friends where we posted up at the bar on a Friday evening.  Had the chance to sample some of the cocktails from their drink menu.  My absolute favorite was the Austin Mule.  An updated version of the moscow mule...very refreshing! I also tried the hush puppy.  It was good, but different.  I am a fan of grapefruit and bitter, but this was maybe a little too bitter for my taste.    By about 8pm we were hungry.  At that time, the restaurant was still busy, so we were seated at an extended bar.  Our waiter was great.  Very informative regarding the menu and the wine list.  He helped us choose an amazing bottle of wine.    Our group decided to sample a few things from the menu and share.  So while this list will look like we ordered the entire menu, we didn't (this time).  Our selections were...Cornbread muffins, fried green tomatoes, succotash, broccoli/cauliflower/leek/rice casserole, the gumbo, and the cider brined pork loin.  My favorites were the succotash and the cider brined pork loin.  I know that some people on here have mentioned it being over done, but ours was cooked perfectly.  Very tender and juicy.  And the collard greens and brown butter sweet potatoes that came with the pork were AWESOME.    I know that some people have had a fit over the gumbo not having a proper roux.  I get it.  But seeing that I have lived in the south, I wouldn't consider this place as authentic southern food. It is southern food with some changes and interpretations.  If I expect authentic fried green tomatoes, I need to go and talk to my Mother In Law in Tennessee.  This is great southern food, but it has an upscale twist.  So just have an open mind if you do decide to go here.    Worth trying!  Just come early or be prepared to wait during dinner hours.   And as other diners have mentioned, it can be a tad loud in the space."}
{"text":"Southern Fail. The menu for brunch is too weird to be taken seriously. It is basically four po'boy wraps and a host of strange items including trout, biscuits, french toast, gumbo and soup. All items require you to add protein for extra money, but that didn't make sense regarding biscuits, soup and half the stuff on the menu. The food we did eat got below average reviews. Corn Chowder was more like Corn Water soup, the gumbo was unseasoned and tasteless and the Bread Pudding French Toast, despite being the 2nd best dish, was underwhelming at best. It was also $5 for a Mimosa shot. Bloody mary was terrible as well.     I suppose we can give them an extra star for the Beignets ($6 for 2), so I guess if I added chicken to the beignets that would have made a meal? It's seriously time to reinvent this menu or  make better use of this place with a new concept. Southern bail."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this restaurant. We made reservations at 615, there were not very many people eating here. We sat for 20 minutes with waiters passing us frequently and would look at us and then pass by. We were never waited on. We left without anyone waiting on us or anyone noticing. Too bad. Looked like a neat place. Will never visit again."}
{"text":"Definitely was not pleased with their food! It looked like a heated microwaved food and put in a to go box! Tasteless and gross! And worse of all I spent $20 bucks and I'm still hungry!"}
{"text":"Ok, I have been there now 4 times.  Two times for drinks and once with my wife for lunch. For lunch I had the trout and it was OK. Its served cold which surprised me a little. Wife had the po boy and it was OK...mediocre flavor. So now we go tonight for a drink and our 17 yr old daughter is with us. We enter and host tells us it is prix fris night... mind you there is NO one sitting at full rail along Camelback road or at long table by bar.  Then manager comes to say he can probably accommodate us but they are closing early. Its 740pm on a Tuesday and we have our daughter with us...pretty obvious we are not intending to close the place down.  Really awkward overall experience.  Tragic because we live in Encanto, work with the neighborhood association, and would love a local venue to hang at.  Highly unlikely we will give it another shot. Very Unfortunate."}
{"text":"The mac n' cheese is definitely a winner and my Gin Jar was fan'freakin'tastic.  Hubby's cocktail was good too.  I went with the enchiladas and they were absolutely lovely.  Service was great.  Red velvet cake was also delish."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Southern Rail probably 20 times in the last year. We were loyal customers but will not be returning after the experience we had last night. We were treated poorly by the hostess (Hispanic woman, 20s, long black hair, bright lipstick) and the manager (Caucasian, tall, bald).   We always reserve our table at Southern Rail (and many other restaurants) through OpenTable. Two weeks ago a few minutes after arriving home from our meal, I received an automated email from OpenTable saying that my reservation from earlier that night had been cancelled by the restaurant. I thought it was odd because we had been seated on time and eaten dinner. Of course we checked in with the hostess, told her we had an OpenTable reservation, etc. The email said to contact Southern Rail directly with questions. I didn't do that, because it wasn't that big of a deal to me to lose the points from just one reservation.   Last night we again dined at Southern Rail. Same hostess from last time checked us in and seated us. I happened to check my email while we were waiting for our check, and sure enough I get another email saying our reservation had been cancelled by the restaurant. This time, since we were still in the building, I spoke to the hostess about it. She was not helpful and was not interested in looking into the matter. I honestly don't know if she was even capable of figuring it out. She seemed like a \"lights are on but no one is home\" type of gal.   I decided to inquire with the manager since the hostess couldn't assist me. I explained the problem to the manager, let him know it had happened twice, that we use OpenTable a few times per week and have never had it happen anywhere but Southern Rail. Instead of showing concern or attempting to fix the issue, he was very curt and started right off with blaming me. \"Oh sounds like you didn't check in when you arrived\". I told him that I most certainly did. He went over to talk to the hostess. Comes back and was very dismissive telling me that it was OpenTable's fault as their computer showed me checked it. He told me to contact OpenTable even though the email clearly stated that I was to contact the restaurant with questions. His tone and general attitude was shocking considering he was the manager. He should not be in a customer service role if he does not want to interact with customers.   I know the issue is with Southern Rail since we use OpenTable all the time and have seen this issue twice, both times at Southern Rail. They have lost a loyal customer. Had the manager been more helpful, even if he was unable to fix the issue, we would be returning."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Southern Rail last night with two other people for Fat Tuesday. The restaurant was busy for the holiday as they had decorated and had King Cake available, so it was festive and we didn't mind that it took quite a while for us to get our order in. Our food and drinks were ok, the service was slow but we understood they were busy. At the end of our meal our server ran our cards and brought back two of the three with the receipt/sign slips inside for all three cards. We let our server know that we were missing one card, which had been run because I had my receipt, and we were seated at the bar, which is close to the register. They started looking for the card but our server rudely asked me at least three times if I had put it in my wallet or if it was dropped where we were sitting. She didn't take my word for it that it wasn't under our seats (she came over and looked under our chairs) and that I didn't put it in my wallet, which after the first two times was frustrating and insulting. After a brief attempt to find my card the manager/owner came over and asked for my contact information. I would have preferred that they would have taken the time to find my card so I didn't have to come back, but at that point they were treating me like the situation was my fault. Much later, at 10pm, someone called me to let me know that they had found my card, were closed and I could pick it up the next day, with no apology. I just spent my lunch break going to pick up my card and again, received no apology for the inconvenience although I understand there were different people working. I didn't need the charge reversed as it was clearly an accident, instead of treating me like it was my fault and putting the inconvenience on the customer, a simple apology would have sufficed."}
{"text":"10/10 Across the board. My second time here, just as comforting as I remember my last visit on New Years Eve. Absolutely no complaints on anything, only straight from the heart suggestions: Check out their iced teas. So good! You may even consider ordering the fried chicken. Crispy, moist and tender. Mashed potatoes are UNREAL!!! I ordered the broccoli cauliflower and leek casserole, don't let the name intimidate your taste buds! A stuffed skillet of hot, thick cream and veggies, ohhhh you won't regret it! Southern Rail has proven to be one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Legit southern food even if they do use fancy words to describe bread and other menu items"}
{"text":"Great food, great service  Went to Southern Rail on an early Friday night (6:30). Good crowd but easy to get a table. They have a good bourbon list and fine scotch list - bartender knew his stuff and was able to make some good recommendations. We had the grilled watermelon salad, trout, and catfish. All were great. Changing hands in the same building is a great stop to walk off your drinks or stop in for a pre-dinner drink and browse.   Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I decided to give the restaurant another opportunity to change my opinion . The waiter was friendly But  there was no bread that came out as a appetizer . The service was slow. I tried their green fried tomatoes poorboy with jam . This was tasteless.  The gumbo again had no vegables and was too salty.  I ordered a cup and just got the side .This place needs a lot or changes"}
{"text":"Came here for social hours, menu was great and prices were cheap. Great drink list and good beer selection. Emily behind the bar was great."}
{"text":"All around great experiences here.   Have been to Southern Rail a number of times. I have had nothing but great experiences here so far. I frequent the bar and the bartenders are always pleasant with me. The food at this place is excellent. I have always loved southern style food and their twist on Southern is very worth while.   I would recommend this place to anyone who values good service, great tasting food, accommodating staff, and a fresh friendly environment."}
{"text":"Really pretty design inside. I liked my watermelon salad with smoked pulled chicken, though I had a bone in my very last bite. John's shrimp po boy was delicious with the house made pickle. But the gumbo was one note."}
{"text":"A pleasant atmosphere, an attentive staff, and a convenient location (part of the Newton on Camelback and 3rd Ave.) make this a good choice for a casual light meal or a special celebration. The Southern cuisine inspired food is very well prepared and presented, as would be expected from a kitchen staff trained by Chef Justin Beckett."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful and staff did a great job as well. I will come back again. I had Scottish salmon wife had seared prime cut her meal was very rich. A+ place"}
{"text":"It's a bit expensive for what you get; I got the steak and it was well-cooked and seasoned but it was not the best cut of meat out there. Veggies were a little bland, but the beignets were good, and I loved the devil egg appetizer. I just wish I got more food for my money on the appetizer. Drinks were a little costly too, but I enjoyed them. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant for an early dinner with two friends to celebrate a birthday. As has been our custom for three years I walked in with a container with a few fancy, expensive cupcakes and birthday candles.as soon as I approached the hostess station to tell the hostess that we had a reservation, she informed me that we couldn't have the cupcakes. She said that it was a health department thing and you can't bring in outside food. Interesting because we have done the same thing- sometimes with an entire home made birthday cake to- most recently True Foods, Clever Koi, and Sochu House and never had a problem or been charged. There are generally four of us and rotate restaurants every month, only bringing cupcakes or a cake for birthdays. In addition, the birthday girl arrived a half an hour early, at 4:30. There were 4 people at the bar and nobody in the restaurant and yet she was told that she couldn't be seated in a booth because it was still social hour! Back to the cupcakes, our server , Chris was awesome, and the poor guy had to deal with the three of us and we weren't happy. I told him that I had brought in a small birthday cake to Becketts Table in the past..how could it be different here? When he spoke to the owner who was in the kitchen he was told that ,yes, sometimes at Becketts it was allowed with a service charge. That wasn't my experience..and what is it..health department or money? So all of this influenced our experience. The place was nearly empty most of the time we were there..it was early. So, the food- Mac and cheese great and creamy, chicken and dumplings still need some work, the BBQ pork fabulous and creative, ribs good. The presentation very attractive and beignets big pillows of delishisness. I give our server Chris five stars but overall, I will spend my money ( and it's not inexpensive comfort food) someplace where I feel welcome and there is more flexibility. I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad... had the mellon soup, which wasn't quite what I expected.  The grits needed salt, the Mac and Cheese was okay... The brocolli/cauliflower bake was really good.  I might try it again if someone else wanted to go there, but probably wouldn't go out of my way.  Kind of pricey too."}
{"text":"Southern Rail had really interesting décor.   We sat at their Community Table that had an elaborate chandelier above.  The ceilings were stained wood.  Pretty laid back atmosphere.  It was quite interesting that there is a book store next to it with a bar.  I would say it was rustic/industrial style with a southern flair.  The drink of the night was their Austin Mule.  It was made with Tito's Vodka and Ginger beer topped with fresh lemon and lime.  Their menu contained items designed to capture flavors of New Orleans with foods such as gumbo, fried green tomatoes and dirty rice balls. Everything tasted ok, but nothing that I was excited about.  Then again, they did an excellent job with their beignets.  Those were amazing.  They had the right texture, with just the right amount of sweetness.  I liked how the inside was kind of soft/doughy, with the outside remaining slightly crispy.    I would like to add that we had a horrible time trying to reconcile the bill.  They do not separate checks (something they should have told us upfront) and the waitress had no idea how to explain it to us.  We almost paid them $100 extra.  Thanks to Kathryn for insisting that we get the bill explained by requesting management to come over and take care of it.  We were all just going to pay extra.  Going forward, I'll choose places that split checks or at least have a better system.  That was exhausting and for those first timers, that is NOT how we normally role."}
{"text":"Southern Rail is the bee's knees.  Try the pork loin with sweet potatoes and collared greens!"}
{"text":"My husband shared the fried green tomato egg's Benedict and a Cuban poy boy sandwich with pork and pickles today. Both dishes were awesome as was the open air restaurant and nice breeze coming through the doors!"}
{"text":"FIRST of all, I've had Southern Rail on my \"to do\" list, for over a year. Tonight was the night, trust me, we weren't disappointed.The outdoor seating invites all customers to, \"pull up a chair, kick back and relax\".   Our pre-dinner HAPPY HOUR, got us in a party mood. Our server Amanda was a pro, VERY knowledgeable on their menu, attentive to our needs and had our best interests in mind as we ordered.  We are fortunate in Phoenix, in having several EXCELLENT choices for dinner. Southern Rail, in combination with a well stocked Changing Hands book store, is a wonderful addition to the Phoenix dining scene."}
{"text":"For those of you who have lived in the area a while, you may remember the wonderful little hole in the wall on Cave Creek Rd called The Ragin' Cajun.  There has been nothing in comparison since it closed.  Until now!  Ordering an ice cold Dixie beer put my taste buds and memories into high gear!  We've been back twice in a week.  Both of our waiters were helpful, personable.  We loved Chris on our first visit.  He was funny and made our evening more enjoyable with his suggestions and comments.  Buddy was our second visit.  Cute, helpful and attentive.  I had the Gumbo YaYa on our first visit and the red beans and rice with andouille sausage on the second.  Both were spot on!  Fried green tomatoes, collard greens, beignets.  I can't wait to go back again and try something else.  As long as I get my Dixie beer, I'm in heaven.  Hmmmm.  Maybe tomorrow?"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and have gone back every week since we first tried it on Valentines day. The service is very good... I really like Redding and Kristen... Probably the best service that I have had in Phoenix. I mean it is so hard to find someone that can wait tables properly. The other places we go have people that are so snobbish, and they have absolutely no reason to be. The southern rail is a breath of fresh air. The manager, Jason, is very pleasant as well. He has a eye for detail that had been lost in so many other establishments.  Anyway, the food is amazing. I have had southern food, but this place is by far the best. We mostly come for brunch, and love the beignets and dutch pancakes. The drinks are very good. The atmosphere is so very nice and bartenders are very nice looking. It is a peace of heaven to be sure. This is now on our rotation of restaurants and is our favorite. Thank you Southern Rail for bringing the old fashion custom of good taste and good service in everything that you do."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for unique birthday gifts and came across Southern Rail for lunch--yum, yum.  We had the BLT Salad with the best pickled relish dressing and a friend green tomato and pimento cheese po boy, which was scrumptious!  Redding, our server was very accommodating and helpful.  I had a bloody mary with their own pickled carrots.  OMG!!!!  What more can I say?"}
{"text":"This place had BIG shoes to fill because I LOVE Beckett's Table (their sister restaurant). While I still prefer Beckett's Table, Southern Rail definitely delivers. Their food is more southern style (which is awesome), but still comfort upscale. The two items that stuck out the most were the Mac & Cheese (I'm an expert and this was hands down one of the best) and the corn risotto. The corn risotto is no longer on the menu, but I swear I still dream about this risotto. It was amazing and the best risotto I've ever had. It was supposed to be the \"side\" dish, but I would have been happy with just a plate of it by itself."}
{"text":"Had brunch there today, and there were a total of 6 people in our party. Our service was terrible, it took forever to get or meals. the waitress did not check back with us after our meals were served, it took almost 20 minutes to get a refill on coffee.  The Fried Green Tomato Eggs Benedict were not great-poached eggs were like hard boiled eggs.  The Cuban Po-Boy has little flavor and was just wet.  When asked to split a dish back in the kitchen-they told us that are not allowed to do that?? The prices were really expensive for very poor food and service.  Lastly, there were a ton of flies due to the \"Open Restaurant Concept\" and the traffic from the light rail and passing loud motorcycles made it difficult to hear.  I will not go back ever again-waste of time."}
{"text":"I ate here for Restaurant Week over the weekend. I'm a huge fan of Chef Justin Beckett and his other establishment Beckett's Table. Southern Rail is a beautiful restaurant with lots of open space and is located inside The Newton right off the light pail path. It has an open kitchen and a large size patio/bar area. Its rustic-style, nostalgic decor that gives off a warm, hospitable feel. Because it was my first time, I went with some of their signature dishes. The cup of Gumbo Ya-Ya for appetizer, the Cider Brined and Slow Roasted Pork Loin for my main course and their delicious Red Velvet cake for dessert. I was met with great service and enjoyed every bite.  The Gumbo soup was full of flavor and delicious. The Pork Loin was nice and tender and you can't go wrong with the Red Velvet cake. I look forward to stopping in again on Wednesday Fried Chicken night."}
{"text":"A restaurant serving food with southern influence near the light rail.  There, my simple explanation of the namesake of Justin Beckett's second restaurant is complete.  But the location and the menu of Southern Rail isn't just a simple southern style restaurant.  Located on the northwest corner of 3rd Ave & Camelback, Beckett's newest food adventure is set in what used to be the iconic Beef Eaters restaurant.  Beef Eaters closed in 2006 after a 45 year run, only to be left vacant for years.  That was until 2013 when investors refurbished the old 17,000 square foot building and partitioned the building into four unique spaces.  The building (now known as \"The Newton\" as a tribute to Beef Eaters founder Jay Newton) now houses Changing Hands Bookstore (along with their First Draft Book Bar), a garden supply store called  Southwest Gardener, and a business consulting firm.  But the true anchor of this place is Justin Beckett's Southern Rail restaurant.  I've been to Beckett's Table (Justin's original restaurant in Arcadia) a number of times and have always had an enjoyable experience.  I've been to Southern Rail once before, but just for a quick cocktail as part of a pub crawl.  Today for lunch, I decided to dine in.  The restaurant is a gorgeous restoration job with a mix of brown and golden wood accents throughout the interior.  Southern Rail echoes Beckett's Table's spacious dining room setup with plenty of room for hundreds of patrons (I'm guessing a capacity of close to 200).  There's room for dozens of people on the patio looking out towards Camelback Road and even a large indoor private group dining room in back.  Old school southern soul and R&B tunes ring throughout the restaurant just in case you were wondering if this truly was a place with a southern tilt.  As I know Justin Beckett doesn't always obey the laws of tradition, I didn't come in expecting to eat exactly the way I ate in Charleston or New Orleans.  But I was hoping to have a few dishes that would at least invoke some of those memories.  To start off, I got an appetizer of their cornbread muffins.  This iteration is made with green and red bell peppers and you douse them with a black pepper honey butter.  While the butter itself had a little kick, this wasn't at all spicy.  I actually liked the flavor contrast of the peppers in the cornbread.  The cornbread itself is still the dominant flavor (rightfully so), but the peppers add a little depth.  When I was looking over the menu earlier in the day on Southern Rail's website, the first thing that shows up on their site is a video of Beckett himself making something marrying a traditional southern sandwich with a classic American burger.  The Muffaletta Burger was simply too enticing to pass up after seeing said video.  The specs on this thing:  burger, creole aioli, provolone cheese, shaved mortadella, sliced salami, pickled muffaletta mix (basically a chopped up mix of sweet peppers and olives), and tomato on a brioche bun.  And the ubiquitous fries and ketchup on the side.  This thing was pure nirvana.  The brininess of the muffaletta mix and cured meats was a perfect match for the richness of the burger and cheese.  Admittedly this was a seriously messy burger to tangle with, but every last bite was worth the effort.  Total cost for the food, tax and tip came to just under $20 (prior to applying a discount coupon).  My server was friendly and efficient and the food itself was excellent.  I know Southern Rail has done Yelp check in specials from time to time (I used such a special during my pub crawl here a year ago) and today they were teaming up with Local First Arizona for an \"Independents Week\" discount good for 20% off your meal.  Wonderful lunch, wonderful building, wonderful experience all around.  It's something I've come to expect from Justin Beckett's establishments.  Its no wonder then that Beckett's celebrity status in the valley food scene is on the rise."}
{"text":"I had my first experience at Southern Rail over the Christmas holiday.  My sister happens to live within walking distance of this restaurant and we decided to have a casual early lunch the day after Christmas.  We got there just after 11AM and the place was pretty empty.  That said, we were seated immediately.  For appetizers, we ordered the fried green tomatoes and the corn muffins.  Both starters can out reasonably quickly and were very tasty.  I especially liked the pimento cheese that accompanied the tomatoes.  Our second round was not so speedy.  A party of four, we all ordered either salads or sandwiches, and I don't know why it took so long to get the food to the table, especially since we were one of only two occupied tables in the entire restaurant.  The entrees, over all, I thought were just average.  My sister ordered a salad with salmon and it arrived with a small piece of plastic in it.  I ordered the shrimp poboy which was very underwhelming considering the $14 price tag.  For that price I expected it to be bursting with shrimp, but it wasn't.  I selected the gumbo side and it was the oddest gumbo I've ever had.  It was more like a meat jus with chunks of pork than an actual gumbo.  Someone else ordered a side of fries and they came out way over salted.  Overall, no one in my party was all that impressed with our dining experience.  We thought the food was just average (with the exception of the starters) and over priced.  For those reasons in addition to the unnecessarily long wait, I have to give it a two star rating."}
{"text":"First things first, the atmosphere is just perfect. Right as you pull up you feel all warm and fuzzy by the cuteness of the Newtown Community Space that Southern Rail is held in. Then you walk up to Southern Rail it self and you are dazzled by fun lights and fixtures, open spaces, an adorable patio, fun large bar, and open kitchen in the back. We were seated in the cutest little booth that over looked the entire restaurant. It was Social Hour (Daily, 3pm - 6pm HOUSE-MADE SOUTHERN LIBATIONS $10/ DRAUGHT BEERS $4/ WINES BY THE GLASS/ WELL DRINKS $5/ and about 17 different small bights 6/28/18 Happy Hour) We started off with a side of Okra $6 and Roasted Brussels Sprout & Bacon Dip ith Noble Toast  ($8 on HH menu normally $12.) Okra was nice and crispy  with a tender middle, battered in cornmeal with a tangy relish sauce. The Brussels and Bacon is a savory dish much like a Spinach Artichoke Dip. For our main dishes I ended up with a lighter meal. The simple salad, local organic green salad, radish, carrot, cucumber, champagne honey vinaigrette $9. This salad was huge and super fresh. I recommend getting a side of the dressing as it comes lightly dressed. My husband got the Smoked Chicken & \"biscuit dumplings\", McClendon Farms Heirloom Carrots, Mushrooms, fresh Pea Pendrils $19 I got a good couple of bites in and it had a great smokey taste and was very filling. We were way too full for dessert this time but cant wait to come back and try the Beignets. The service was prompt and friendly. I just don't have one bad thing to say about this place. We will be seeing you soon!"}
{"text":"The menu items are traditional southern, but the execution is way off. Gumbo had no depth and was under-developed with a layer of oil. It also lacked salt. The ribs were too chewy, the sauce was good, but the meat lacked the flavor of any smoke. The cornbread had bell pepper in it, which is an odd (and gross) combination of flavors. Nobody at the table wanted to eat more than one bite of the cornbread.  The blackened catfish is not really blackened. It's seasoned with a blackened-like crust, but it's not the real thing. And it comes with a sweet and regular potato that seemed out of placed in the dish. The  ribs and fried chicken dishes contain a lot of meat given the price. We learned why once we started eating. They are using a low cost/grade meat distributor (Shamrock) rather than local suppliers. If you took the Shamrock tour as a schoolkid here in the valley you might remember the various grades of imported meat they distribute to grocery stores and such. Very surprised that Beckett would do this. So this is the  McDonalds of Southern food. Low quality, cheap, and ready for mass consumption. Good service, except they forgot to ring in our dessert and that took forever. Dessert was really good. Given the other options in the area we will no be returning."}
{"text":"Checked this out last night & I must say that it might just be my fave new place for cocktails. Wow! Hunter is the mixologist there & this guy knows how to mix a cocktail. You must order an old-fashioned from him and I loved the dog hunt ( not sure the name) cocktail!!! Can't wait to go back for more! Had the fried green tomatoes and biscuits and sausage gravy, both solid. Wed night is fried chicken night & I need to check that out!"}
{"text":"Ate there tonight . Did not like it . We ordered medium well steak came out med rare ! I ordered the salmon , asked for sauce on the side got butter instead . I  asked if it had alcohol in it . It took 3 people to figure it out .Then was told it had  white wine . I said if I knew that I wouldn't have ordered it . I said what if it was for a child , wouldn't that be nice . I have had much better food at Outback at half the cost . Will never go back .  Not even half a star but isn't on here ."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for the first time during AZ Restaurant week. We usually attend Restaurant week twice a year and have for the past several years. We always try a different or new restaurant each time. We had the fried green tomatoes and the gumbo as our starters. We did not sample each others starters. Loved the pimento cheese with the tomatoes. My DH had the meatloaf for the entree served with broccoli and a mushroom gravy; I did not care for it,but he loved it. I had the cider brined pork loin with sweet potatoes, and collard greens; I loved the nice thick cut and taste of mine. We ordered the cornbread muffins as a side to go with our starters($5),they came with 3 muffins for 2 people. We shared them,but had 1 left. I did not care for them- I only had a bite. Good thing since it is difficult to share 3 muffins with 2 people. They should serve them for 2 people(1 each) For dessert we sampled and ordered the chicory beignets and the butterscotch banana pudding. I can not recommend the beignets;they did not taste like coffee or have any flavor at all,very disappointing. I would however go back just for the pudding, it was great. The gingersnap cookie on top was wonderful. Our meal was $33./person and included a house red or white glass of wine or a craft beer on tap. We chose the Sauvignon blanc and the Four Peaks peach ale. We had server Rochelle and she was very efficient as were all the staff members from the time we checked in at the hostess stand to the moment we departed. The  restaurant shares a building in an area called The Newton with Changing Hands bookstore,First Draft-a coffee,wine, & beer bar, and Southwest Gardener store. There is a complimentary parking lot and an overflow lot east of 3rd Avenue. The light rail passes right in front of the building,with a stop not too far away. The patio looked very nice,but we ate inside. The floor to ceiling windows open all over the restaurant and were open on the nice weather night we were there. Not sure if they close them once the weather gets over 100 degrees. The place is a little noisy. They offer lunch,social hour, and dinner. I believe Southern Rail has been open for just less than 1 year. Love to come back to try lunch or Happy Hour soon."}
{"text":"I liked this place but my gawd it was expensive!  I had 2 drinks, fried green tomatoes and the fish special for $55. That's not including the tip. It's also VERY loud! Our service was pretty good for a semi busy weekday evening."}
{"text":"This was my second experience eating here. The first time I got a Po' Boy and it wasn't anything special. In fact, I can't even remember which one I ordered. I wasn't impressed with their menu choices. There are some weird items like cornmeal crusted catfish with green tomato kimchee. I like kimchee, but what is it doing at a Southern restaurant? Maybe in a South Korean restaurant. The fried green tomatoes are OK. The pimento cheese is good. I thought the safe bet this time would be a cheeseburger. They can't mess that up, right? I asked the server to have it cooked medium. She said, they can't do that. It comes out one way with thin patties. The burger had two very thin patties that tasted like they were microwaved and burnt. The pickle slices were almost as thick as the burger. I couldn't really taste the charred onions. Basically, it was meat, cheese and pickle. It was terrible! I rather have In-N-Out and not pay $14. Also, I asked for ranch. The server said they didn't have ranch. What kind of restaurant doesn't have ranch dressing? This place is so cute and I love the open dining area, patio, etc. But, the food is awful. I gave it two stars because the service was good. If you just want to come out for a few drinks and enjoy the atmosphere, then this place is for you. If you plan on eating, this isn't the place for you. It's overpriced and the food lacks flavor. The beignets are good, but don't wear black if you order them. They cover the entire plate with powered sugar and it gets everywhere! I don't know why they can't leave the edges of the plate sugar free. If you do decide to go, check out the great bookstore next door."}
{"text":"Amazing southern style food. The dirty rice balls were delicious. The ribs were some of the best I've had in Phoenix. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful night here on my son's birthday. What made it so special was the great service that we had out of our waiter. Even though we were in a remote far-off corner of his outdoor patio on a chilly evening, he kept his eyes on us and we were never left wanting. [They have great heaters and they aren't afraid to use them.] The atmosphere is not as cool or charming as it could be -- I wish they'd spent a bit more to make the place look good. But, I did like the food, and that's what counts. I had a huge piece of pork tenderloin, and some great Mac 'n Cheese. While nothing is especially unique, their comfort food does just that . . . it gives you the feeling that someone who loves you just cooked you a home-cooked meal. I don't get that feeling in a restaurant very often. The next night we had dinner in another famous Phoenix restaurant (Tarbell's) and it was a let-down compared to this. When the waiter heard me reference my son's birthday, he brought out a large desert item which was enjoyed by all. A great experience! We were there on Arizona Wines night, and enjoyed a great bottle of Cochise Country white wine for half off. I like promotions like that."}
{"text":"This grade is not biased on the food or service. Both were wonderful. This is biased on the fact that they have an out dated policy that they will not slips checks. Personally it's 2015, you should be able to split checks. It doesn't sound like a big deal but it really is to your customers. So if you're planning on enjoying an outing with friends plan on doing some math, splitting one bill between cards or taking on the whole check yourself."}
{"text":"Wonderful looking restaurant. Cool ceiling and decor. Even the bathrooms are pretty. Ok. Let's get down to the food. We had the brioche with Apple butter to start. Apple butter was creamy and sweet. Delicious. The brioche buns were average. Nothing special. Thank goodness Apple butter was served with it. For my main course I had cider pork loin with sweet potato mash and collard greens. The loin needed salt but was cooked very well. Flavor was fine. Nothing spectacular. Sweet potato mash was yummy     For dessert we had the bread pudding. It was delicious and if I wasn't drunk before I ate it, I definitely was after. The bourbon sauce is definitely for those of legal drinking age. All in all it was a good meal. But would I go back?  Maybe. There are so many great restaurants in phoenix"}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere, good service. The fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese are not to be missed. Even if you're not a pimento cheese fan, set that aside - it works. And the roasted Brussels sprout bacon dip? Oh, yes, definitely. I also had the BT flattop cheeseburger, which was delicious. And last note, odd to mention, the music they were playing was great. Lots of 70's tunes, some of it kinda obscure or one-hit wonders."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with some friends on Mardi Gras this past week...pleasantly surprised! I've passed by the location a few times and just from the looks of it, I knew I had to try it.   The ambiance was on point. The vibe from the staff was great, the music was even better, and the food might just wanna make you slap your mama!  We started out with the dirty rice balls for an appetizer. I'd say they were cooked well, the dirty rice was just as spicy as I was expecting. Nevertheless, the flavor was rich and not bland.   I had the fried chicken with Yukon gold mashed potatoes and collard greens for my entree. The fried chicken is brined over night and man does that add so much value to the taste! Oh I forgot to mention, it's a whole half of bird!!! The spuds were great, but I wasn't super pleased with the flavoring of the greens. Good, but not great.   Finished off dinner with...Beignets!! Let's just say I was in heaven! And, I'm happy to report they regularly offer Beignets, not just for Mardi Gras. Stop by this place when you have a chance. You will not be disappointed, promise."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to check out this place for a while now since we love Beckett's so much.  Very cozy rustic feel and knew we'd get some good \"home cooking\" yet at a restaurant. 1/2 rack pork ribs were delish! I'm a fan of the sauce and this is coming from the girl who grew up with legendary Dinosaur BBQ from NY. Mom ordered the chicken and biscuits and was thoroughly pleased, minus the mushrooms. Sis got the butternut squash soup to start which was just heavenly. She had the brined pork dinner which looked good but I think she said it was a little dry.   I suggest not \"splitting\" the cornbread salad because there wasn't much on the plate but all together it was a great salad. Server was quick to clear our plates. When I worked in the industry we were taught not to clear plates until everyone was finished. He took a while to take our order as well but was otherwise attentive with water, extra napkins, and a finger bowl with a wet napkin, as I had the ribs. Would definitely go back. My boyfriend is from the South and would appreciate good Southern comfort food with some New Orleans style favorites. Wanted a good hot meal after our horse trail ride so this hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Service was fine, servers were attentive and met our needs. The food was okay, not terrible but nothing to rave about. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to Southern Rail twice. Once for lunch and once for dinner. Dinner is THE ONLY time you can order the fried chicken. Need to be cognizant of that if you want to tried their much talked about item.   Now I have to say three might be unfair. It's more of a 3 1/2 but I'm rounding down this time because it was sold high to me and I thought it was good but not spectacular. I'm also very big on fried chicken and the dish was a mild disappointment.  So first and foremost, the dinner special fried chicken. It was a very very generous portion, a breast, a thigh, a wing and a drum stick. It was a lot of food for a very reasonable price. But I personally disliked their frying process, it felt too corn-mealy for me and didn't have that spectacular crunch you crave.   My friend and I also shared a fried green tomato appetizer which was fried the same way so it was average.  The other time I went with a girlfriend for lunch and we got the following; the trout board, chicken and biscuit dumpling soup and the gumbo. They were all very very good.  Now on to the highlights. This place is great for any sort of meal. They have live music at night which, the time I went they played some southern jazz which was pretty good, went along very well with the ambience. Would definitely recommend for a nice casual date with have the option to dress up a bit nicer and not feel terribly out of place."}
{"text":"A great idea, but poor execution. We made reservations for their Jazz and Jambalaya.  Sorry, there was no Jazz (not sure how to categorize the music, popular?). We started with Dirty Rice Balls and Fried Green Tomatoes. Entrees included Jambalaya, Red Beans and Rice, and Gumbo. Nothing tasted authentic, or as it should taste. If they are going to present their own rendition of these traditional NOLA foods, they should be advertised as such. Service was incredibly slow. Should never take two and one half hours to serve four people. Don't think I would return. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Beef Po Boy.....no.  Gumbo.....no,no,no.  Slow service no one in restaurant. Left a really bad taste. Maybe the worst lunch I've had ever!! 2 Po Boys for lunch, only water, $26.00. Nice waitress. Great music. No point in saying more."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for brunch on a Saturday. I ordered the avocado toast which was somewhat bland. However, a girlfriend of mine ordered the fried green tomato benedict which was amazing! I would absolutely return and try a different dish."}
{"text":"I think it's time to get back to basics and revamp this menu. This place has declined since I was here a year ago. Not a place I tend to frequent. Here's why: I was here last week during restaurant week. My friend got the 3 course meatloaf dinner and I ate a couple apps. We came one hour before closing time. I was quite disappointed. The food was not hot, the cornbread dry and most everything was tasteless and bland. The red velvet cake came as sadly presented sliver with 3 dots of frosting on top. Isn't this supposed to be a layer cake?! Regardless, it was sad. I had corn soup and cheese grits, both bland or had a weird flavor. This place could be dynamite if they really took time to keep the menu Southern and Simple. They should look into serving chicken and waffles but revamp that current fried chix and Mac n cheese recipe also. Just a thought."}
{"text":"I visited this location for my birthday dinner based on an article I read on a local blog. The restaurant is beautiful and the staff was helpful. However, the food was just \"okay\". For as much as me and my guests paid, I expected to be \"wowed\". Decent portion sizes. The chicken and dumplings were not what I was expecting. Salty, the chicken was dry, the dumplings seemed like they were just pieces of cornbread. Also there was an issue with splitting the check which we were not made aware of previously. All in all, I don't think I'll be returning because the food above all else, wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"Good customer service with decent food. Ribs and fried chicken thumbs up, pork loin under cooked."}
{"text":"What an awesome dinner we had at Southern Rail last night. We started at the bar with the Medlock Moonlight cocktail and my husband had the Three Sheets coffee. (This would be my ONLY complaint is that the coffee was like warm). The bartenders were attentive and kind.   We closed out and went to our table where we enjoyed some bubbles while perusing the menu. We decided on deviled eggs and dirty rice balls which were both on point. Then onto dinner of fried chicken for my husband. Perfectly crispy, flavorful, light and a clean flavor. Since I'm in a \"less meat\" phase of eating, I chose the mushroom, potato and leek enchiladas. OMG!  This was the start of the show for me. So packed with flavor, balanced texture....and that red enchilada sauce!!!  I ate the rest later at home and I was sad they were gone. We move in a week and I must go back for more before I go.   The manager was super helpful in reassuring me on our bottle of wine selection. It was the Cosentino \"The Franc\" and is was so good and such a great price point for the quality.   We finished with German chocolate cake with a Nutella mousse. )I ate most of that myself).   I haven't been this pleased with a restaurant experience in a long time. Well done Southern Rail!!  Thank you S"}
{"text":"Deviled eggs - not much flavor.  Camelback salad - spicy dressing, super salty bacon. Brioche rolls with apple butter - delicious!  Grits - good. Fried chicken  - crust was crunchy not crispy. Could use more seasoning.  Collard greens - spicy, large pieces, didn't care for it.  Mashed potatoes - pasty.  Gumbo - good.   Beignets - ok - more dense than I like.  All in all, overpriced."}
{"text":"This place was right by our hotel so it is convenient. My husbands stay was longer than mine and he only came for happy hour because the prices were not bad, but overly priced otherwise. When I went with my husband we both got food poisoning....yuck! We both ate the happy hour deviled eggs and red beans and rice and definitely got sick.  BUT, ambience is great and drink prices are better. I'm just hoping it was an off day when we got sick. I am also just being nice because I will never eat there again :/  Also....the bar chairs are EXTREMELY uncomfortable."}
{"text":"We just had a Friday afternoon lunch at Southern Rail.  Our party spent 146.00 before gratuity and we spent two hours in the place.  Had to wait for our table for 25 minutes even after making a reservation.  The wait staff, managers and restaurant owner made no apologies.  The food was good, but definitely not worth the super slow service.  We had a wait of about 35 minutes once we ordered and the establishment was not filled to capacity.  The appetizers came out with the entrees which is quite disappointing if you have to wait so long for your meal.  We won't be back, the cornbread, okra  and gumbo can all be found other places for half the price and half the time.  It's a shame.  Loved the renovations to the old Beefeaters. Will not recommend."}
{"text":"Today is my birthday and what way to celebrate than Brunch at a new place. I ordered the shrimp and grits and sealed the deal with their delicious beignets. Now here's the great thing about my family we all ordered something different so I got a bite of everything.  The food was delicious, the service was top notch and as an added bonus they brought my beignets out with a candle for my birthday and they were free.  I can't wait to come back.  P.S. there's also a super cute bookstore next door"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dining experience at The Southern Rail. I recommend the duck. The service was fantastic."}
{"text":"This is a lovely space with great ambiance. Our waiter Josh, was amazing and had some good recommendations.  However, for the price I had higher expectations of the food. It was average. The small plates are decently priced for that style of al a cart eating, but the entree item I had seemed grossly over priced for the portion size. I don't think I'd return simply  because I don't feel like I got my moneys worth, but the waiter made the experience  worth while for a rare expensive night out. However, if you rarely go out and have expensive meals, there are better places to go for the money."}
{"text":"We've been to Southern Rail for lunch several times. The food, service, and ambiance are great.  Went for supper last night.  Fried green tomatoes for the starter were wonderful. Crisp, not greasy. We had the cider brined pork and the flatiron steak for our mains. Both were excellent.  Try the sweet tea.  Not too sweet and nicely infused with mint.  Perfect on a warm day. The service was attentive without being intrusive.  At night it's a little loud, so if you want conversation I suggest sitting next to your companion instead of across the table. All in all, a lovely evening."}
{"text":"First time at this amazing \"new\" place. Food was excellent and our server (Jordan) took great care of us, all of his suggestions were spot on. Great selection of beers too. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and acoustics in spite of a very open floor plan.  Super nice servers, attentive and knowledgeable.  Overall good vibe and I have added them to my PATIO dining choices for when the nice weather returns!  SALADS exceed expectation - Shrimp Remoulade was flavorful and the shrimp had good texture, not mushy.  The Barley/Kale was outstanding, the flavors complement each other nicely.  Companion added the smoked chicken (generous portion!) but I think next time I would try it with shrimp to sop up the chimichurri sauce that comes on the side."}
{"text":"What can I say....this may be the best newer restaurant in town. I laughed with happiness, I cried with joy. At one point the best bartender in town, Emily, had to pinch me to convince this experience was indeed real. I will most likely be here waiting for the doors to open tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"Southern Rail.. how can you go wrong with a name like that? It's southern and its near the rail line! Southern Rail is housed in The Newton Building. A building of common commercial buildings holding true to its roots from its name sake: Jay Newton. Newton was the founder of the iconic Beef Eaters that used to be here and now houses Southern Rail. BUT within The Newton building is a coffee shop and a bookstore too. Chef Justin Beckett has achieved greatness with Becketts Table and now Southern Rail. The menu takes good American classics and 'souths' them up! I'd like to think Chef Beckett just brought the dirty south to the valley of the sun! This place is vibrant and has a cool patio with a great decor and lively music piping through the speakers that take you back in time. Listening to southern Lynyrd Skynard while one drinks on trendy sips is pretty legit, dontchathink?! We opted for a table outside on the patio. IN the fall this will be a great place to come and hang as the fireplace is in the center and adds to the 'look'. There is a cool sound to the light rail and that just adds to the atmosphere when it passes by. We came here during Restaurant Week and for my birthday dinner. I immediately loved the drink menu names: This Dog Won't Hunt! or how about the Hush Puppy Hush! Ha! A little strong for this weak wine sipping Californian, so I got the Kings Rex to start with: Champagne; honey; fresh squeezed lemon and brandy. It sounds strong, but it didn't feel it! It had the lemony taste of a French 75 that you see in New Orleans. Even if I didn't like the dinner I was about to order, I decided I would come back to Southern Rail for the Social Hour that runs from 3-6pm and have that drink again. There are also local beers on draft from 4Peaks and Mother Rode and a smattering of good wines too.  Birthday dinner time! I opted for the Restaurant Week price fixe menu/ $33. I got the Chicken Skin and Hot Sauce Deviled Eggs that were the good old fashioned southern type with a little hot sauce drizzled on top; 3 eggs in a serving and they were so finger licking good!  Next course I chose the BLT Salad. I expected this to be a small portion, as you sometimes find that with price fixe menus; THIS was not. Lots of thick cut smoky bacon, fresh tomato, grilled green onions, all atop ALOT of lettuce and drizzled with a combination of a cola bbq and a thousand island spicy type of dressing. I could have made this my meal! For my RW entree, I chose the Shrimp and Grits. I do love me some old fashioned southern shrimp and grits when I am in the south and these did not disappoint. The grits were rich, creamy and topped with several bbq shrimp and sauce to round out the richness. MMMMM MMMMM good! (In my best southern voice!). This RW meal also came with a glass of either a white or red wine or a draft beer. I got the red wine, a San Reckoner 'r' Red Blend and it was very good! The dessert menu was as tempting as a cool brook on a hot southern day, but I didn't have room in my full tummy! They have southern favorites like Banana Pudding made with wafers or Bread Pudding made with Pecans! Our service was very good; our water never went dry, even though there is a carafe of water you can fill on your own leisure placed at your table, our attentive waitress never let that happen. Our apps came when they should have and not before the entree or while we were still enjoying them. Thats important! Bourbon and BBQ night is on Monday and Tuesday and we inquired about that: $20 for a platter of BBQ , ( the selections seem to change), two bourbons OR a bottle of wine! WHERE can one find that kind of deal at a great up and coming trendy restaurant ??? I can't wait to come back and get me some more ! I do declare Southern Rail.. You have stolen my heart!"}
{"text":"The majority of the food was really nasty and had no flavor at all like this place is supposed to be southern . I would not recommend coming here at all there are way better places in Phoenix. the only reason this place gets one star is for the cheese grits"}
{"text":"We couldn't wait to try this restaurant. Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. We started with cornbread muffins. My cornbread muffins are much better. And I'm not a professional chef. Then we had the po' boys and gumbo on the side.  The bread was delicious; the sandwiches overall were just alright. The catfish po'boy had the fish put in last so it was only in one bite in three.  That gumbo was not what I was expecting it all, it looked and tasted like pork stew. No seafood, barely any andouille. My father and I were eating and having the exact same thought: \"I miss Baby Kay's.\" Unfortunately this place is quite a bit more expensive than Baby Kay's was. I don't think I'll be back. Which sucks, because it's right down the street from my house."}
{"text":"We came by for brunch with friends and had an amazing time!  First off, the restaurant is stunning...hats off to the decorator on a job well done!  The staff was super friendly and understanding...our group was having a great time and they seemed to have fun along with us.  The fried green tomato benedict was so unique and so ridiculously good...my mouth is actually watering thinking about it while writing this review.  The beignets are not to be missed either...trust me.  Looks like another visit to Southern Rail is in my future!"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night the place was busy the atmosphere was pleasant. I had the pork loin with mashed sweet potatoes. Excellent flavor enjoyed my meal  my companion had the salmon was flavorful and cooked to order. We ordered a flat iron steak to go which was also very good. I would say the portion to price was a little steep but I would most like go back as we enjoyed every morsel"}
{"text":"Just ok. Expensive.  Burger was crispy around the edges and very thin.  Fried green tomatoes had more breading than actual tomato.  Service good when actually at table."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, sat at the bar... Couldn't be more satisfied. The house toast was one of the best appetizers I've had in quite some time. The bartender provides excellent service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered in using Postmates and was excited to get some yummy southern cooking. I was sadly disappointed. Mostly flavorless except for the salt. I had chicken andouille and smoke chicken and dumplings. When I get takeout, I love to order 2 dinners and have leftovers for a couple of days. I spent $44 and threw the left overs away."}
{"text":"We hit this up for restaurant week.  Service was really slow, maybe because of said restaurant week but the food was good and would go back for another visit. It is nice to see this style of southern food in the valley though.  We shared some starters, the fried green tomato and gumbo, both were solid. The tomato looked to be a real nice heirloom and was wonderfully crispy fried.   I had a veal meatloaf which was out of this world for how fluffy and moist it was but crusty on the outside. The gravy was a most excellent pairing.  I also tasted the fish and pork chop, both good, the pork chop was perfectly cooked tender and juicy.    Desert was red velvet cake and a dutch chocolate cake both of which were average and nothing to write home about. But they did have beignets which finished off the night on a high note.  Not sure it was the best beignet I ever had but hey, it was a beignet!!!  Definitely earned a trip back for us, just hope there isn't so much of a wait between the courses next time. That might be about the only thing keeping it from a 5* for me."}
{"text":"This was our first and much anticipated visit. The restaurant is very charming. I like that it's a bit brighter. The menu offers lots of variety and as a girl from Mississippi I was looking forward to some tastes reminiscent of home. I was not disappointed! Drinks were strong yet flavorful. Fried Green tomatoes with pimento cheese spread were nice. We had the gumbo app and added shrimp, knowing how subjective gumbo tastes can be I thought this was a great option to give it a try. It was tasty. However, could have been much hotter in temperature. The servers spiel of the flat iron sold me and it was amazing. Perfectly cooked. My boyfriend had the catfish and it too was great. A bit on the spicy side for his usual taste but I enjoyed the taste I had and he liked it regardless. The corn on the cob pieces that accompany this dish are tasty but having to cut it off the cob to enjoy is odd. I get creative plating though! Side dish of collard greens was the only miss for me as I thought the vinegar was too forward and strong. We finished with a (giant) piece of coconut cake to share which was amazeballs.  Our server, Chris was fantastic!! He was very busy but hit every mark of attentiveness during our visit. His knowledge of the menu was great and we really liked his approach and personality. With so many great menu items enticing me I'm certain future visits are close on the horizon. We love Becketts table so we knew we were in for a treat here.  On a side note: what's with the Japanese good luck cat? We had a good laugh with Chris our server over this one."}
{"text":"My first visit. Lunch. The menu is very different. My tomato and shrimp bisque was outstanding. I could eat it twice a day. My Cuban sandwich was very good, with homemade pickles as promised. The place is spacious and bright, and the staff is young, pleasant and on top of things. I will be back."}
{"text":"Food solid.   Service was good (if a bit slower than usual).  Beignets like sopapillas... super yummy.  Love the chicken & andouille gumbo.    Bourbon sauce French toast was sweet and decadent.    Catfish po boy solid but nothing earthshaking.  Environment is generally laid back and pleasant.    Service is very pleasant and competent, but food was pretty slowly paced - maybe just the nature of the place.  1.5hrs for Brunch seems a bit deliberate, but I suppose it's refreshing that they're not in a hurry to turn tables (just that much of the time was waiting the long gap between beignets and entrees).  Curiously sullen hostess (not a teen) seemed to think it was ok to walk by staring at guests w her grumpy disposition.   Tried a polite smile to break the awkward interface but only seemed to make her darker."}
{"text":"Tremedous experience all around. Our waitress Emily was an experienced and top-notch server. Our visit was later on a Thursday night, we did not have to wait for a table. The decor is beautiful and inviting.  We started with the dirty rice balls and a gumbo. Both were flavorful and well portioned. My partner had the chicken and dumplings, and although I was trying to be \"good\" and eat the kale salad, I most definately wished I had ordered that or the fried chicken. The dumplings were firm and tender and the broth had complex flavors that were delicious.   We neded our meal with the beignets and I have to say the only thing that would have improved those would be a bowl of hot chocolate sauce. There were three on a plate drenched in powdered sugar. I've eaten beignets in many places and these were as good as any I've ever had.   All in all, this restaurant was one of my favorites on this trip to Phoenix and Sedona! If you have a chance to stop into the book / bar, do so as there was a musical group there and a vibrant vibe!"}
{"text":"Food was very limited but cool. The service wasn't that great. Our server practically did nothing but got the tip. Wish the guy who actually brought our food, filled our glasses and cleaned the table actually got it.  We saw him all of 2 times. He also didn't do a very good job of what he said he would do either. I asked if there was any way that they could do just a veggie plate and he said it wasn't on the menu but he was sure they could do it. So I  ordered the corn, Mac and cheese, grits and greens which were basically all the sides thinking it would be on one plate instead he brought out the individual huge family portions. I just kept it and paid for it because I didn't want to make a big deal about it. I just feel if he couldn't do it he could have told me and I would have ordered something else or ordered less. Luckily the person I went with was happy to take the rest home. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic service - the hostess greeted us promptly and we were seated quickly.  Our waiter was excellent; quick service on cocktails, our water was never less than half full, he knew the menu very well and had excellent timing for when to appear.  Collard greens -- fantastic!!!  Brown Butter sweet potatoes -- OMFG!!!   Not an official side, but we pleaded and they gave us a dish as a side.  Excellent beignets -- they even came with a warning about the powdered sugar!  :P  Spicy gumbo w/lots of sausage.  Bread pudding -- wow.  just wow.  Wife had the fish special with a corn flan -- Ms. 'Always takes half home' ate everything!  Would give this place 5 stars, but the noise was a problem.  We were too close to the 'community table' and could barely carry a conversation because of how loud those people were."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar prior to the Steve 'n Seagulls concert at Rebel Lounge. I had the Mac & Cheese with chicken added. Very good! I wish there was lobster, however.  I like the atmosphere and the drink menu. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"The Mardi Gras menu had no crawfish, not even in the $17 gumbo. (Chicken & sausage). 1 1/2 later our mediocre green tomatoes arrived. The drinks are tasty though."}
{"text":"Food was good but not equal to the price.   Service was friendly and fast.   I would not recommend coming with a group of people.   They want to itemize the bill.   They tried to split the bill evenly at first.   After explaining this wouldn't work they spent 45 minutes trying fix it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go in Phoenix.   The food is great and service is very friendly.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pork \"Cuban\" po'boy. All I need to say. This sammy was amazingly messy in every way. It's not too big not too small and get the fries, they're delicious! I asked for a side of hot sauce and it was CRYSTAL!!!! One of my favorites. Yum! The creole lemonade can't be beat, get that too. I will dream of this sandwich and cocktail. My experience also helped bc I had a hot date. Xo"}
{"text":"The service was good, and the food was good. I can't say I was completely wowed but I did enjoy myself."}
{"text":"Southern Rail is on the right track but at the time of this review is brand new and possibly still working things out.   The servers seemed well polished and the cocktails we tried were tasty and strong.  We shared a small plate of House Smoked Trout with Pea Cakes and Tomato Jam. I thought this dish was put together well and was my favorite of the plates I tried. The Trout was smoked nicely and wasn't too much smoke. The Pea Cakes reminded me of Falafels but green with fresh peas bursting out and the Tomato Jam wasn't just sweet Tomatoes it had a little Kick to it. They all harmonized nicely together.  The starter plate of Cauliflower Casserole was for my taste (maybe not yours) was overly generous with cheese and seemed to lack the onion cream that was in the description. For me this plate was too heavy and I think someone just slipped with the cheese that wasn't in the description of this dish. Possibly an opening hiccup.   I need to reveal a full disclosure that I am sensitive about smoked foods and only care for a mild smoke taste that might differ from you.  I tried the Chicken and Biscuit Dumplings. I received a bowl of many nicely made cheesy dumplings in a very smoky dark sauce with 2-maybe 3 ounces of nicely prepared dark meat chicken a few very thin shaves of Local McClendon Carrots, Chunks of Mushrooms and some fresh pea tendrils. I was slightly disappointed for a few reasons. As good as the Biscuit Dumplings were and they were. This dish for me was too much Dumplings and should have been called Biscuit Dumplings with Chicken. I could only eat maybe one and a half and had I think three maybe three more dumplings. In the description of the dish was the mention of McClendon Carrots. I was expecting carrots to have a co-staring role and not to be  just a few shaves for color.  For my taste the sauce was WAY too smoky but might be great to other people who like smoky food.   My husband tried the Smoked Chicken and Andouile Sausage Gumbo. He said it was good. He eats Authentic Gumbo whenever he is in New Orleans and said the one at Southern Rail was good but thinner than other Gumbos he tried and also more smoky than others he tried but still good to him.  3.5 stars On the right track but a LOT of Smoke a little steam."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate lunch here today and it was delicious!! The building is beautiful, very modern and hip! I started off with the red sangria and it was light and refreshing. Perfect to drink on the warm patio. I ordered the chicken and dumplings, the waiter described it perfectly. It was smokey flavored and delicious. The chicken, carrots, mushrooms and biscuits in a warm smokey broth. My husband had the gumbo ,Cuban sandwich and colored greens. I think he licked his plate. The food is priced appropriately and our server was attentive and informative.  I look forward to going back and trying brunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"I have a feeling that Southern Rail is not going to make it.  The service is just so/so, it may be because they are new and working out the kinks, but we didn't particularly feel welcomed.  Everyone seemed kind of frenzied.  I do love the atmosphere, it's very open and fresh looking.  I also like that they kept the booths from Beefeaters, something new something old...  We lived in Atlanta so we have high standards when it comes to southern cooking. The ribs were a standout.  They were tender and the meat fell off the bone.  The gumbo was also excellent.    Unfortunately, just about everything else we ordered was not good.  Let me start with the biscuits which were hard as rocks.  Biscuits should be light and fluffy....  The fried green tomatoes were too firm, not sweet the way they are down south.  The corn bread was dry...the biggest   One of the biggest food disappointments of the night was the coconut cake it was so dry it was hard to eat.  It is a major fail.  I wanted to like Southern Rail but I am not a fan.  I give it two stars for atmosphere and the excellent ribs."}
{"text":"Great svc...awesome Southern hospitality (our waitress addressed me as \"ma'am\" the entire time, which, I found to be super Southern and uber respectful)...beautiful, clean restaurant...wonderful 3 piece jazz band...reasonable happy hour prices...BUT... (damn big 'ol \"but\" will get ya every time!!!!)...the portions and flavor (or lack thereof)- came up short. Me and tha bf wanted to like this place. He suggested we go back for cocktails. (The attention to superb customer service is the savior here!) I think the food is a bit overpriced and I'm a bit underimpressed with the taste. Agreeing with one of the fellow yelpers- I know of a few more places in the valley that have that authentic Southern flavah."}
{"text":"You pay a lot for very little. I went there for lunch and ordered the chicken and biscuits along with the grilled cheese with tomato soup. The portion sizes for the chicken and biscuits were two half cup containers and the contents inside were very much like eating Asian cuisine instead of traditional chicken and dumplings. The portion of tomatoes soup I got was slightly bugger than the container you use to fill ketchup in at most restaurants (black with lid).  I also ordered the bread pudding, which was good, but it had the appearance of a thick slice of French toast and the only distinction was the heavy bourbon and maple glaze. I couldn't recommend this place any less. Lots of money for small portions and small flavors."}
{"text":"Stopped next door at Changing Hands to grab a new read and then stopped in Southern Rail to check the place out. I loved the ambiance at Southern Rail, great for group gatherings, or just a relaxing wine. The menu was filled with unique items. I went with the trout with a sweet pea cake. The fish was smoke and served cold and I never had trout this way before. It really brought out he smokey flavor and it was perfectly paired with a berry jam and sweet pea cake. The service was excellent and being so close to my home, I will definitely be coming back here with friends!"}
{"text":"This place is EVERYTHING!! The happy hour has amazing specials to where you could easily just eat off of apps alone. The wine selection is very extensive. I came here twice and both times was consistent with the fried chicken and greens. The grits are sooo creamy and delicious. Perfect twist to southern comfort favorites!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous fried chicken and the salmon was sooooo good good with the spinach cauliflower"}
{"text":"Disclaimer - I only had drinks at the bar. I had the Creole Lemonade, which was delicious. The acoustics at the bar were awful though, and I could barely hear my friend who I'd gone with - a huge bummer for an avid conversationalist."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere great food  A great twist on classic Southern comfort food-our server Chris was excellent! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't reviews this place before.  I've enjoyed it many times and Try out dishes you won't find anywhere else in Arizona.  I find their classics to be very classic and full of flavor so feel safe picking these out.  There weren't many small apps to complements my entree so I just went with it anyway at risk of looking like a fatty. Gumbo was solid and thick, poboy was decent. Loved the avocado toast just added a pinch more salt but true grapefruit really brought the dish to life.  The croique Monsieur was legit. By far my favorite dish.  The wine list is extensive and really brings into focus local wines, which aren't the best but appreciate the local push because they are good enough to enjoy for a casual lunch for sure."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my work team last night. Overall a really good time in a fun, unique environment. The decor is different with wood ceilings that look like they are reclaimed  from another building or ordinal from the prior establishment on the same premise. Regardless the ceilings, light fixtures and furnishes made for a comfortable vibe. Very enjoyable.   We ordered a few appetizers to start. I'd never had fried green tomatoes before last night and wow, what a surprise! They were more delicious than I had imagined. Next came an interesting platter of pickled vegetables, various spreads including a yummy one with bacon and caramelized onions. My absolute favorite were the pickled carrots. After that came warm, delicious corn muffins. I happen to love corn bread so these were right up my alley.   As others have said, there were long-ish gaps between courses, but no one at our table seemed to mind!  Service was great, our server was attentive and  so willing to explain each menu item. Every employee we talked with was accommodating and professional. Great job here!   I had the Mac and Cheese but must say its not the best I've ever had.   My biggest disappointment of the night?  My dessert was so small  and I shared it with my hubby. Dang!  Should ordered my own....Next time!    Would love to go again and support our local entrepreneurs."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is excellent except the food.  Second time here, second time disappointed.  Maybe I'm picky because NOLA is my favorite vacation spot.  Overly breaded cornmeal catfish po-boy was lacking any actual fish, seemed like eating a cornmeal sub.  The muffuletta was pretty gross.  I've never had a muffuletta with a hamburger patty, ham, and cheese (no olives?).  I think the waiter gave us a Cuban (still why a ground meat patty!?) by mistake, but still an unappetizing combination.  Also the bbq here is a wash.  Seems like over sauced oven cooked meats, or precooked sausage, that they throw on an indoor grill for the grill marks.   Service was excellent, plating presentation is nice, decor is inviting.  Kitchen needs a reboot."}
{"text":"A friend and I were next door at Changing Hands and after glancing at some fine books, we got curious at the bar next door.  Intrigued, we decided to check it out.  The bar was full.  After all, it was Thirsty Thursday.  The host accommodated us at a table even though it was reserved for some people who were expected to show up within the hour.  So, our time was limited.  And to ease our \"press for time\" stress level, the service attendants did just that...attend attentively.  We got water on schedule.  Our waiter worked diligently to get us our meals quickly knowing our time was short.  But as soon as we tasted the fried green tomatoes, we knew we were in trouble!  There was no way we were going to devour our food and savor it at the same time.  We knew our limited time meant that we would have to inhale and run! And that we would have to return at a later time when the clock would tick our way.  The food was simply DELICIEUX... (gotta write 'delicious' in French) because it was that good.   We added to our plate the crispy duck leg confit and, of course, good ole mac n cheese.  I have a feeling we also ordered the dirty rice but I can't recall for certain at this point.  Perhaps I was thinking about it so much that I thought it up on my plate.  Southern Rail is one of those restaurant experiences that you won't soon forget.  The taste of the food is etched on your palate for quite some time."}
{"text":"Holy rice balls! Hubs and I stopped in at the tail end of the Urban Wine Walk. We had always wanted to try this place so me figured we'd make it our last stop as we may want to linger. Oh, linger we did! I tried the Chardonnay they had for the wine walk, which was nice. But, I quickly became very distracted by the plates being shared by two ladies sitting next to me.   We were happy to find that we were there during \"social hour.\" Hot damn! Bring me a menu! They have small plates on special from 3pm to 6pm every day. I am an afternoon patio drinker, not a Saturday night, leave the house at 10pm drinker. So, a saturday afternoon happy hour is awesome.  They also had glasses of wine for $5. I had the rose. So refreshing! Exactly what I needed on our first over 100 day. Hubs had the Dos Cabezas Red Blend. Nice size pours, too. We ordered the dirty rice balls and the cup of gumbo. Total cost of the small plates was $9 during social hour and it fed both of us! The rice balls had a relish that went with them that was cool and crisp. Perfect to go with that warm gooey rice ball. The gumbo had a massive amount of smoked chicken in it with a huge scoop of rice on top. I'm not kidding, it was just as good, if not better, that the gumbo I had in New Orleans.   We sat at the bar and all of the bartenders were just nice as could be. One even ran our wine walk glasses through the dishwasher for us. That was just the nicest gesture. They also have a good amount of misters going on the patio so it did not seem like it was 101 degrees. They had a sangria that everyone was trying for the wine walk that I can't wait to try out on that patio. Lots of other tasty libations as well. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went here a few months back. My boyfriend and I both ordered po boy lunch specials, and fried okra as an appetizer. I had collard greens as my side, which I had been craving forever so I was super happy. It was a good value for a more upscale lunch. Cocktails were also great as was our service. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and dinner and both visits were very enjoyable. I think their food is quite good and I really like their menu offerings.  I've had their jambalaya for lunch which is spicy hot and makes my mouth water just writing about it. Most recently I sampled their chicken and dumplings which is more like a hearty chicken soup with chunks of their brioche in lieu of of the doughy dumplings most of us have come to expect.  Speaking of their brioche pull apart rolls, do try them along with some of their tasty apple butter.    I've also tried their ribs and fried chicken. The former were very good with a slightly unusual marinade that is citrusy and tangy. The fried chicken was crispy outside and very juicy inside.  Also had some excellent cocktails and a delightful glass of wine.   Very friendly and attentive service. I really like this place and will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Order the fried chicken. Let this be my sole advice to you. Rich, buttery, tender, and flavorful meat encased in crispy crunchiness envelops your mouth unforgivingly. How can something so seemingly simple be this incredible? My hubby and his friend offered bites of their dishes so they could keep stealing more bites of mine. I was getting ready to stab hands with my fork trying to protect my find. Alas, I failed.  The Dog That Won't Hunt cocktail is the drink I tried to nurse throughout dinner. It has Templeton Rye Whiskey, Sombra Mescal, maple syrup, house made lemonade, AZBL, \"Figgy Puddin,\" and orange bitters. Very smooth drink. If you are not paying attention, you could annihilate this drink in 30 seconds flat, which is why I made the conscious effort to take my sweet time enjoying it. Yes, being a southern drink, the sweet part is there to hide the punch of the alcohol so no surprise there.   Being the mature adults we are, we ordered dirty rice balls for an appetizer. Three balls come per order so we got two orders to double the fun. Sausage, onion cream, and corn relish nestled in a breaded dirty rice ball. It was a twist or variation on another favorite of ours, Italian rice balls. You can't go wrong with ordering them."}
{"text":"Most outstanding brunch in Phoenix!! We are humbled to have a chef in Phx who knows his ingredients and constructs his dishes so well!! Well Done Chef Justin!"}
{"text":"Southern Rail is an amazing place with a delectable twist on Southern cuisine. With a warm and relaxing ambiance, the wait staff was efficient and cheerful. We will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Southern food.. Good...side salad was really good, gumbo pretty good. But I'm not from the south. Nice place, good service"}
{"text":"Definitely a very nice place,  the patio, the bar, everything is done with attention to detail.   The food was good but not great. Same for the service.   Mac n cheese,  OK but could have been richer.   Fried green tomatoes...  Likely the highlight of the dinner.   Duck.. Good but small  Gumbo... OK but lacked real flavor.   Wines.. They are half off on Sunday, that was a nice surprise.   I'd go back but I am not in a hurry.  I think I'd likely go there to hang out at the bar and patio,  have some drinks and order a few small plates."}
{"text":"Casual feel, awesome food! Waitress (cute ted haired gal) was just the right \"fun\" too! Not only saying why something was her fave but why.   Several in our group started off with the Creole Lemonade... explained as \"Long island ice tea\" with a kick... and that it was! I believe several of those were ordered, even after happy hour (ends at 6pm).  We started with the deviled eggs, mac n cheese & dirty rice balls (all on the happy hour menu btw)...eggs were creamy & the bacon crisp-deliciousness! The Mac- I'm super picky with this item..I literally almost cancelled my entree and just ordered more of this that wasn't shared... yes, it should be on the menu as an entree! For my taste, needed a little fresh cracked pepper to complement the bacon lardons but...oy-yum!!   Salmon was ultra light, crispy edge, cooked perfectly.  And well, the family didn't put up with my picture taking of their food.. they didn't want to wait! All were delicious and cooked the way it should be! Definitely will stay on our Arizona restaurant list!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here on a Sunday at 4:30 in the afternoon.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The host told us that it would take 5-10 minutes to setup a table for us and suggested we sit at the bar.  Being the sheep that we are, we sat at the bar and after about 20 minutes wondered why we had not been seated.  My guest asked the host who said he could not find us when our table was ready.  Really?  Once we got seated, the service continued to be spotty.  The food, however, was delicious.  We both had the California Salad and it was delicious.  I did get the Avocado Toast to compare to my homemade version.  Theirs was much prettier but mine is much easier to eat given my choice of multigrain over their very crusty version (and considerable less costly).  I was a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Went the second day of opening and was grateful for the professional staff, drinks were GREAT, menu awesome, service was a 10!  Recommend the experience to everyone, we needed something new in the valley."}
{"text":"OMG... Tried the fried chicken for the first time here.  Best %#^* fried chicken I've ever had.   Stopped by the bar before sitting down.  Good choice and excellent wells to choose from.   Stop by and check them out."}
{"text":"Truly nothing to write home about. The food was just okay. Service was cool. Gumbo was good. It lacked flavor compared to the kind of gumbo I've had. The chicken dish I had was just alright as well. It was missing flavors that made the entire experience just feel so incomplete. The sangria wasn't much of a sangria. It tasted like some full on bitter red wine with chopped fruit trickled on top.  We're not in Phoenix often, but when we're in town, we like discovering new places and coming back to the ones we really found outstanding. Unfortunately, this wasn't one of them.  The ambience is great and the book store/wine bar next door is a genius idea..... But the food here just isn't worth the price tag on it. Our chances of returning are unlikely."}
{"text":"Went for social hour,  had the Austin mule. It was tasty,  served in a stainless steal mug.  Also had the fried green tomatoes, spicy and crunchy. The 3 stars are due to the service. I wasn't  ready to order,  my friend was, so be got his drink.  Then we had to make sure to get the bartender's attention in order to place our order.  He brought no plates,  napkins or utensils so we had to go and take them from one of the tables that was set up.  The bartender was our server, not very friendly and kept saying \"ya\"instead of, of  course,  anything else?  The gal that came after was soooooo much nicer, like day and night."}
{"text":"this was a first stop for us for restaurant week spring of 2015.   we had heard very positive things about this new (to us) restaurant, and i was particularly intrigued considering i grew up in the deep south, where everything was fried, came with grits, and seasoning was considered \"bacon\".  alas, we now don't eat meat, so i was surprised when my wife picked this place. she said the menu offered a few non-pork options. we started with the fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese. they were nice. crunchy. a little on the bland side for my taste. when your dining companions say \"i like yours better\", i take that as a huge compliment.  next we tried the corn risotto and the red snapper with red rice for our entree. the red snapper was super flavorful and a fish you don't regularly see on a menu. the corn risotto was also a treat, almost like a desert the corn was so sweet. we ended with a red velvet cake....moist and delicious, with just the right amount of buttery taste goodness.   before we even started our order, our server asked if we had any dietary limitations. we told him about our non-meat diet. he pointed out all the items on the menu that did not contain meat. which is why we ordered those 2 entree items. as usual, food from a southern inspired restaurant is rarely pork-free and sure enough, the red rice on my plate was full of bacon slivers. noticeable on the first bite. i pointed it out to the server, he apologized and asked what he could do.   but really, what could he do? i don't know, so i just pushed the rice off to the side, hoping our desert wouldn't have hidden bacon bits in it. i wanted to ask for a trade out of the grits or collards, both southern staples, but like i said, i wasn't going to risk having silent bacon show up again.   decor is beautiful. clean, homey, trendy, hip. overall, if you are looking for authentic southern food, this is pretty good, albeit a little on the high side."}
{"text":"Southern style cooking giving Arizona residents a chance to experience upscale comfort cuisine. Let me just start by saying this place has the best Beignets in Arizona for sure! If I had only reviewed this place based on them alone I would have given 5 stars. The closest thing to Cafe Du Monde you'll find out here. This is a sister restaurant to Chef Justin Beckett's well known Beckett's Table. Southern Rail has great decor and style with an awesome outside patio area! The sophisticated touch on comfort food makes it well worth the dining experience. There is definitely some New Orleans charm sprinkled into these recipes. Make sure to check out the Fried Chicken, Brioche Rolls, and of course the Beignets. I promise you won't be let down!"}
{"text":"Excellent food (get the smoked trout...you won't regret it).  Awesome ambiance/atmosphere (sit in the patio if you can).  Service was friendly and hospitable.  This place is on point."}
{"text":"Let some friends talk me into going here a few nights ago.  Walked in without a reservation and were seated within a few minutes.  Decor was interesting, but there's one problem: NOISE!  Between the concrete floors, flat wooden ceiling and glass along one wall, the place is deafening.  Could not hear the petite waitress's voice (apparently she couldn't hear us either because when she informed us that they were out of cornbread (how does that happen???), she asked if we wanted the brioche rolls.  The answer was \"No, that's OK\", but they showed up anyway).  Food was decent but not fantastic. Gumbo was not very zesty.  Agree with others that Chicken & Dumplings was anemic with the chicken portion.  Servings were anything but generous for the price paid.  Been there, done that - probably will not return as nothing stood out and I really like to be able to hear my dining companions."}
{"text":"Pros: great food, great service Cons: loud, pricey  The food was really delicious. Split the grilled watermelon salad, cornbread, grits, gumbo yaya, and coconut cake with a girlfriend who was in town visiting. The salad wasn't really \"grilled\" that I could tell, but still tasty. The smokiness of the pork in the yaya was fantastic! I will dream of that dish for a long time. Want to try the duck or BBQ shrimp next.   Cool venue. Love the entire development. Please just tweak the prices so I can become a regular."}
{"text":"The location and layout is pretty nice, and for a weekend evening it surprisingly wasnt very busy.  The waiter was very attentive and overall service was very good. The casserole with shrimp was ok, a little more oily than expected.  My favorite was the grilled cheese appitizer w/ red pepper tomatoe soup  The bread pudding was decent, but most of the flavor was in syrup/sugar topping."}
{"text":"Will have to revisit in a few weeks once the kitchen works out the kinks. The menu looks a lot like Beckett's table in layout, but with a southern twist.  Warning, the place can get spendy.  You'll order some fried green tomatoes, some mac and cheese and the brioche rolls and then tuck into a cocktail, an entree and dessert and you'll find yourself dropping about 80 bucks.  The interior is very welcoming and bright.  You can't beat the location next to changing hands bookstore.  Warning, do not park next door in the business building next door.  They will tow!  Our table found things a bit over cooked with the only flavor being salt rather than more nuanced smokiness, also the lack of hot sauce was a little disappointing.  I loved the brioche rolls which come in a pool of butter in a cast iron pan, although they are a buck a roll.  The fried green tomatoes are what enticed us in, but we found them on the thin side with a breading that seemed like something premade and dredged, the pimento cheese needed a kick.  Like I said, it's never fair to judge a place this new, but it's great to see something new go into the old Beef Eater's space which was languishing.  The interior bar is (there are two) is great looking and one of them opens into changing hands. I have a feeling there will be a lot of blind dates going on there :)"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try it for a while, so on a Tuesday..1130 am we gave it a go.   First, let me start by saying there was possibly 4 other people eating/waiting for food when we sat .  I thought the place would be slammed, but i could hear a cricket if there had been one.     Food - I ordered a  trout plate. The accommodations it came with were ok/decent. It was a pea type cake.. Good, not great..didn't taste fresh..but good. The trout was cold, which i knew when ordered..but dry..very dry. The collard greens i ordered a side of were fantastic !   Doubled/deviled eggs..basic. Needed seasoning. I honestly didn't see one sprinkle of paprika or pepper etc?  Friend ordered catfish Poboy.. Dry and basic. I wouldn't recommend as the strips were slim and small.   Now the killer part was it was a 45/min food turn around wait...horrible for lunch. It was however explained there was only one cook available..which i get...but as slow as it was the mgr or staff should have rolled sleeves and got to cooking.  I may return for a bbq/Bourbon night..but never again during a lunch break.   I hope the get it togather, has allot of promise, but failing fast with the time issues. Needs a serious restaurant guru or marketing head."}
{"text":"I drive by this restaurant twice a week and was finally able to try it out yesterday. My husband being from the south has introduced me to southern cuisine and I have been a big fan. To my surprise, not only does this restaurant serve southern food, it specializes in my favorite region of the south, New Orleans!! What a treat!!  I had the muffuletta po'boy with gumbo as a side. If you have never had a muffuletta in New Orleans, there is nothing quite like it. Southern Rail has their own version of it and it's pretty tasty! I loved it. The only problem with the Gumbo was that there wasn't more of it, soooo good!! My daughter wanted to eat all of mine. After our meal the server asked if we wanted desert. My usual response is always an automatic No. BUT she said \"We have beignets!\". I had to try those as well and they didn't disappoint! The service was great, the ambiance was hip yet comfortable and the food was unlike other places in the valley. I'll be bringing my hubby back for a date night in the near future! So glad I stoped in for lunch!"}
{"text":"Been here three times, every time sat at the bar, only ordered drinks. The menu looks interesting. First time it was in the afternoon and not busy so my needs were attended to immediately. Second was early Christmas Eve evening. After I told barkeep I needed a minute he gave me at least 7, closer to 10, until I finally flagged him down. Of course they sold out of the beer on the menu I wanted. When I asked a different barkeep about Wi-Fi password, she wasn't sure. When I used provided password she gave that didn't work, she said \"I guess it's down\" and didn't inquire about the correct password. Next time try harder to please your customers. Third was mid afternoon and didn't have any problems."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago... The crispy duck leg confit was reduckulously good. I would have liked more collard greens though. They satisfied my southern side fo sho'!  The pimento cheese spread atop of the Fried Green Tomatoes was a welcomed blast from my childhood past. My \"date\" had the cider brined pork loin which she generously shared a bite of - I felt while tasty it was a bit overdone - and a big spoonful of the brown-butter whipped sweet potatoes were so dee-lish I almost had to skip dessert. ALMOST.  The coconut cake, while on the dry side, was nicely held together by the luscious coconut pudding. Thankfully, we opted to add a la mode. No regrets! Definitely a good idea to make a reservation and get dropped off. Parking is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere!  Looking outward while the light rail goes past, you feel like you are in a train station (or at least I did).  The decor is bright and clean; but seemed to get louder as the time passed.  Our reservation was at 6.  We were greeted and seated timely and courteously.    I'm glad I reviewed the menu online as I still wasn't sure what I wanted to order.  We started with the Fried Green Tomatoes (how can't you?).  They were pretty good, but not like the ones my grandmother would make (hers were thicker and a different breading).  I ordered the Blackened Prime Flatiron.  The steak was good to order, but I felt it lacked anything to constitute calling it blackened - no crust, no extra pepper or spices that I could tell.  The succotash was hardly worth talking about, but then again, I don't ever recall an excellent succotash?  The other 2 people in my party ordered the Cider Brined Pork Loin and the Chicken & \"Biscuit Dumplings\".  Both of them enjoyed their entrees.  The staff was friendly and on spot with filling up our water glasses and escorting us to the restroom, when asked where it was.  Dessert.  Not sure I have ever spent $11 on a dessert, but last night I did.  I ordered the Bread Pudding a la mode.  It was pretty great.  Another person at my table ordered the Pie in a Jar, apple a la mode, and said it was great as well.  My biggest gripe would be the noise level.  They had music on; by the middle of our meal, all I could hear was the bass under the loud voices.  It made it difficult to have a conversation with the 2 people at my table.  I know this establishment is brand new, but look forward to going back and hopefully seeing some improvements."}
{"text":"BLAH. That's about all I can say. The food wasn't horrible but it sure wasn't good. Hardly any seasoning at all. It would be great for those who automatically start pouring salt on their food. Easily forgettable."}
{"text":"Went there with some of my gal pals for brunch.   I am not familiar with \"southern\" food except to have the belief it's greasy and basically unhealthy.   Well, not true!    My gal pals had the fried green tomato benedict and croque monsieur.  They added eggs.  We shared beignets as well.    I had the camelback salad.   The display of the salad was enticing.   Every item was separated and not just thrown within.   I asked that it not be drowned in dressing, whereupon our excellent server, Jordan, informed me it is lightly tossed.   And it was.  The green tomato benedict was good.    The idea of a fried green tomato did not appeal to me initially.    I must admit, it didn't even taste like a tomato.   It was lightly fried and seasoned.  The bread of the croque monsieur was tasty albeit I am not fond of bread.   The beignets were good although I didn't have anything to compare them to having never eaten it prior.  Not something I'd order, though.  Bread with powdered sugar?   Nahhh!   Not my type of food.   One of my friends ordered the breakfast bloody mary.    She pronounced it quite good.    One of the other friends tried it and agreed.   Jordan, our server, was great.   Most helpful with his advice and very professional.   Even though I had trepidation about going there, I'd go again."}
{"text":"very disappointing. Always go to Beckett's Table & thought we'd score at their sister restaurant. Not so much. Stepdaughter & I both ordered the brined pork tenderloin & it was tough & tasteless. Hubby ordered the ribs & said they were just \"ok\". Nothing special. Server Vanessa should not be in this industry. Couldn't smile, just mechanically did what she needed to do. Ordered the deviled eggs & she stacked the new order on top of a dirty plate when she served it. The owner walked through the restaurant a few times & didn't acknowledge any patrons, unlike Beckett's Table, where we are always greeted at least once during dinner. Will not be returning ever."}
{"text":"Really great place to relax. Attentive service. We always get the appetizers and share. Fried green tomatoes, dirty rice balls, baked cauliflower, corn chowder, fried okra, and deviled eggs! All great with an extensive spirit and wine menu.... Love having the wide doors open to the patio.... Have been here several times and have had a consistent experience each time..."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with most of the food, fried chicken was dry and had too much coating, other dishes were not really done in Southern style according to friend diner!"}
{"text":"Spoke with Justin earlier this week on an industry related matter. Justin, Chef invited us in on Saturday to try his brunch. Absolutely the finest brunch in Phoenix today!!!  Nice work Chef. Enjoy your summer."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the drinks and the outside and inside seating. Great bar menu. I ordered gumbo it was good. Nice place to visit for meeting with the girls for a drink or two or date night. Parking is good and love the bookstore next door."}
{"text":"Just moved to Phoenix from New Orleans and I've been reallllllyy craving some good comfort food. Southern Rail isn't bad but the food has a lot of unnecessary frills (like apple slaw??) and lacks seasoning -- which is direly important in any 'Southern' dish. The drinks are pretty good, though!"}
{"text":"Do not go to this restaurant as part of a large party.  Unbelievably slow service and over-priced.  Went in with a group of about 25.  Separating our checks turned out to be a major project which they are nigh incapable of performing.  A project manager from Booz Allen might help them out.  They did not give us our itemized bills before paying; they wrote a list on blank paper and listed the prices by seat number.  I've been to Restaurants with larger groups and have never seen such a lack of coordination and transaction processing.  The food ranged from good to nasty and certainly is not worth the price or the wait."}
{"text":"So this place is located, for any of you locals who have been in the area for a while, where Beef Eaters used to be. Across from the restaurant is a book store and it looked as if there was another shop onsite as well.   I liked the Po' Boys sandwich that I had. It had decent flavor and my daughter enjoyed her meal as well. Would probably go back for a second visit, but wouldn't make it a regular spot to stop by. It seemed like the menu had a Cajun theme to it."}
{"text":"Where to begin on this restaurant: a group of coworkers and I decided to go to this restaurant as a going away present for a coworker that was leaving. It was a total of 16 of us that decided to give this restaurant shot.  Everything was wonderful about this restaurant including the food, the drinks, and the service! The waiter was awesome - I think his name was Chris.  When it came time for us to leave we asked the waiter if we could split the bill and we were told that it was restaurant policy that they never split the bill for any large groups. So we spent just under the next hour trying to figure out who purchased what and finding out what each person's financial responsibility was.  At the end of the evening, we all ended up splitting purchase anyway. This is not what I consider a very customer friendly experience. At the end of the day the waiter probably would've ended up with more tips if he was able to split the bill."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. The name alone made me quiver but the food definitely DID NOT!!!!   It sadness me when a restaurant basically changes it's  menu constantly. What is the purpose of doing that!?!   Okay let's get to the food..... I order shrimp and grits. Now this is southern staple, everyone loves this dish but guess what I didn't love there version of  this dish....   The shrimp tasted like store brought, frozen and then thrawd out... Yuck.. the shrimp were also way too small.  I thought shrimp with grits should be just that, beautiful prawn sized shrimp.... NOPE NOT HERE! The grits were thick.... not smooth and velvety like grits should be.    My girlfriend ordered the fried chicken....OMG... heaven help this fried chicken. The crust wasn't light and crispy,.... it was over cooked with a  thick batter that made the fried chicken to heavy.   The drinks were delicious but who gets a cocktail wrong!   Let's talk desserts... the bread pudding was okay but the beignets were amazing!!! BRAVO TO THE BEIGNETS so light and fluffy with tons of powdered sugar.... HOORAY THEY GOT SOMETHING RIGHT!!!   I must give a shout out the  best waiter we had named Andre. He was so attentive and catered to all of our needs.    Trust me if it wasn't for him, we probably would have left.    When you represent southern cuisine you should cook southern cuisine! Not pretend to cook It!"}
{"text":"With great reluctance I write this Review as I visited with such high hopes.  Just a word about the \"Service.\" Our Waitress was sensational and I could see her and others interfacing with Customers and they seemed equally as tuned in.  Unfortunately the food did NOT measure up to these folks stellar  service. I never reviewed Beckett's Table because I felt I was in the minority and maybe just hit it on a bad night (won't go back there either) but now a second of his Restaurants shows poorly to me and I can't imagine how others have given such raving Reviews.  I visited with a native New Orlinian and he, like I was sorely disappointed. We tried:  * Fried Green Tomatoes with Pimento Cheese - lacked taste and was clearly overcooked. The \"Gold Standard\" in Phoenix is certainly Short Leash Sit and Stay and these didn't even come close.  * Fried Okra - Fresh is the best thing I can say about it. The batter was fired \"hard\" and wasn't pleasant to eat  * Shrimp Po Boy - NOT even close to what one would expect, plus a small portion. (Old bad joke, \"the food was bad but there was a lot of it!\") Chef should take a trip to Pappadeux's, with certainly the best Po Boys in Phoenix that I have had.  All in all, will NOT go back even though my inclination, based on other Reviews is to try it one more time. Too many great alternatives!"}
{"text":"Waiter Chris was awesome!  Fried green tomatoes were perfect. . Loved the Austin Mule drink!"}
{"text":"Recently went here with the Breakfast Club for a UYE. Service was great the entire time. The restaurant was not that busy as we got there right as they opened for brunch. I think our group of 10 may have been the only table our server had at the time.  I shared with a friend the Fried Green tomato Benedict and a Dutch pancake which is sort of a pastry cup in this case filled with mashed potatoes, corn, fried chicken strips and topped with gravy.  Both were very good.  While not inexpensive or hugely filling the meals were reasonably priced for the quality and the overall atmosphere."}
{"text":"For November's Breakfast Club UYE, we headed on down to Southern Rail, I won't lie it's been in my bookmarks for months now so I was pretty existed to be giving them a try.  I started off with a cup of chicory coffee with cream and sugar that was a great cup of coffee, made me think back to when I was in New Orleans and tried my 1st cup.  I also couldn't resist ordered up some beignets too, 2 fluffy pasty pillows of goodness just surrounded by powdery sugar of heaven, oh the sweet bliss! And haven't even gotten to my meal yet haha.  Now I did come for breakfast, but my mind was quickly changed after I learned that the chef's daily flavors for the savory Dutch pancake was.  Roasted garlic mashed potatoes, roasted corn on the Cobb, fried chicken surrounded by a warm bread bowl (The Dutch Pancake) with brown gravy, I even added an soft boiled egg to it. Oh My Gawd this was comfort food! So dang delish, I devoured it in no time, couldn't believe it!  Glad to have finally made it to Southern Rail now I am looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Southern Rail for dinner and just had the privilege to sample their lunch menu.  It is delicious and absolutely love the atmosphere and ambience . A culinary tour of the south from the Carolinas on over.   Loved the fried green tomatoes, po boys, gumbo and trout! Chef Beckett never disappoints! Make your way over for dinner or mark your calendars for the new lunch opening August 4th!  Can't wait to head back - may have to try a Wednesday for fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we bought out of town guest to try this place with us.  The reviews look pretty good and so did the menu.  We had a reservation too!  The hostess took us to our table and it only had 1 chair and the table was picked empty (no salt, pepper, not silverware, plates, etc.).  We had to sit around waiting for them to set up the table for the 4 of us, meanwhile the inside dining area was 1/2 empty and had tables set up.  The service was kinda of slow.  I got the fried chicken.  It was tasteless and had way too much batter.  I also order the cornbread muffins.  It was savory not sweet?  WHAT?  Overall, the dinning experience was OK and tasteless food."}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent. The only issue I had is that the social hour menu did not mention the dirty rice balls had any meat but the main menu did list sausage. I was mid-bite when a friend identified this, which caused me to immediately stop eating the dish. I let my server know that this should be brought up to the manager so they can update the menu. Aside from this, my server was great and so were the other dishes we ordered."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late brunch and really enjoyed the sweet potato hash. The gumbo was also good, though not necessarily a huge step above any other solid gumbo. There were several other items on the menu that looked good, and I would visit again when back in town."}
{"text":"I went to hang out with a friend for Restaurant Week.  Great patio.  Good drinks.  Ok food.  Just ok.  Dry.  My fish was overlooked. I put salt on it.  I hate salt.  And Southern Food usually has plenty!  I was open for a great dinner and it was a \"meh\".  The desert was yummy.  Although I can't remember what I had for the life of me. Just that desert was my favorite part.  Not a good sign.  I will remember the patio.  Bummer.  I love Southern Food... But not Southern Rail..."}
{"text":"Southern Rail is a great idea on paper. Actual execution of said idea is about as poorly executed as a North Korean missle launch. First of all, it is directly north of the light rail, this might due to poor location choice, but I'm chalking it up to a bad spin on the wheel of generic concept restaurant names. We stopped in on a Monday evening before a baseball game. The restaurant was clean, quiet, and empty.. save for a couple at the bar and a few dining in the back. The BBQ platter was the special of the evening so that seemed like a fine choice. It was to entail a platter of barbecue and 2 drinks for $25. I mean, how bad can a southern restaurant mess up barbecue?? SR went to great lengths to do just that. The waiter dropped the platter and walked away with zero explanation of what we were about to ingest. I mean, I get that it's food, but when you order something blind there needs to be some sort of delivery. There was none. I'll do my best to describe what we received; a cold cut ham po-boy (à la quiznos), 3 slices of a pickle, a cold (possibly smoked?) fish filet, and some sort of mashed pea and corn mush, battered and fried in corn meal. All of which were bland, haven't touched a BBQ grill or smoker, and have never seen so much as a drop of barbecue sauce. I'm not denying that this wasn't a platter, but this was is no way, shape, or form, barbecue. This was an abomination. Nary a spice to be found! I'm convinced that Justin Becket's knowledge of southern cuisine is derived solely from what he's seen from Guy Fieri. Simply put; your food is bad and you should feel bad for serving it anywhere other than a company picnic. The upside to this is that the space is nice so I'm excited for whatever replaces SR. It can't come soon enough."}
{"text":"Yum. I love southern food. I ate enough while living in Louisiana back in 2010 to know what's good and what's not. This Restauraunt has some flavor! The rice balls and fried green tomatoes were tasty and had a spicy kick. I had the muffaletta burger and collard greens; both of which were amazingly delicious.  Service was on point. Atmosphere was cozy with lots of open light. Can't wait to go back and try other dishes....namely the fried chicken and gumbo."}
{"text":"We have been waiting to visit for almost a year and we finally made it out! We felt like we were cutting it close going in an hour before close but Aaron made us feel so comfortable and welcome he made the experience!! The food atmosphere and drinks were all way better than expected!! Thank you again Aaron!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with family and tried the macaroni and cheese and fried green tomatoes as an appetizer. The fried green tomatoes were crisp and served with a spicy sauce. Very good. The macaroni and cheese was ok but wasn't something that couldn't have been made at home. They also provided cornbread which  was a little dry. Had the fried catfish for the entree and it was served over a tomato relish with a few potatoes and corn on the cob. It wasn't bad but didn't have the 'wow' factor I was looking for. Also tried the fried chicken which was nice and crispy and red beans and rice which were also delicious. The waitress was very nice and attentive but it took about 40 minutesfor the food to come out with the restaurant being about a quarter filled. I liked the open restaurant concept but they need blowers to keep flies out as they were flying around our table."}
{"text":"Since they started  repurposing the former Beefeaters we really wanted to try their food, I will admit the atmosphere is great (except when the patio doors are open and the light rail goes by).   My first issue is that and i don't fault the restaurant at all is the communal restroom.  True that they have two mens rooms however only one handicap accessible ,when that one is occupied try getting from the wheelchair and then getting up after using it.  Now let's get to the food.  I took my East coast family out as an after wedding dinner, the server we had was good  (However wasn't very busy and seemed like forever to wait for soda refills.  The fried Green Tomatoes were bland and a let down to he taste buds.  The final nail in the coffin was when we were leaving we asked the server to box one meal that wasn't finished.  He only put 2 items in the bag cornbread muffin and chicken,  We definitely wanted the sides too (mashed potatoes and veggie mix).  In closing the chances of ever going back is like the chances of me winning the Mega lottery (ain't going to happen)  Just calling it like I see it!"}
{"text":"For a solid southern dish with a twist - this is your place! For those with more mild taste buds I wouldn't recommend because you wouldn't appreciate all this place has to offer. Donuts /beignets (sp?) are amazing!!!!!   Little pricey - but you pay for the quality of the food!   Cool atmosphere, just not my favorite type of food.   Recommend it nonetheless, classy place!"}
{"text":"Just tried the gumbo here at southern rail. Not too heavy, just right with shredded chicken and sausage . The place has a simple southern style and has plenty of space. next door offers a different bar- coffee shop with a neat book store full of knick knacks  and what nots. Also there's plenty of space for studying. It's kind of a shame it's not more packed, perhaps it's due to the fact that it's Thursday. All I know is I'll be coming more to try out more food and drinks"}
{"text":"The location is great, the design is cool but the food was nothing to write home about. With the exception of the smoked trout, my bf and I sampled a few of the dishes and found them lacking in seasoning or any type of southern flavor. The fried green tomatoes seemed to be dipped in bread crumbs and fried - with not even a hint of flavor. I've had tastier greens from a can. The cornbread was forgettable. I did use the left over succatash in an omelet the next day and it was good after I added a sprikle of seasoning. We are going to give it one more try (lunch) to see if the Po Boys can win us over. Maybe."}
{"text":"We were able to visit last night without any reservation or wait. We decided to not take advantage of restaurant week because I knew I wouldn't eat very much. Our order: Dirty rice balls, fried green tomatoes and fried chicken. Everything fried!  I wasn't a fan of the fried green tomatoes, but I liked the dirty rice balls and the fried chicken was yummy!! It was a generous portion of chicken, corn on the cob and mash potatoes. My hubby shared everything and we couldn't even finish the fried chicken plate.   Service was meh, but I didn't mind too much. Overall, I enjoyed our dinner and would recommend. Total of our bill before tip: $44"}
{"text":"Great patio. Fun happy hour. Tasty cocktails. Friendly staff. Deviled eggs were underwhelming, but the red beans and rice was perfectly yummy! Very fun place to hang out for cocktails and a snack."}
{"text":"Went for Restaurant week. $33 for three courses and a glass of wine.  Red Wine- clean and fresh tasting. Perfect middle ground red to go with anything on the set menu and a nice solid pour.  1st course - Antipasto salad was fresh, with multiple slices of the meats and cheeses. There was a great vinaigrette dressing on it, which really complimented the spring greens. They marinated the tomatoes in a sweet vinegar which also added a pleasant pop to the salad.   2nd - BBQ plate - ordered it GF but came with mac salad. No worries. I offered that to my SO. Waitress came by, saw the mistake and immediately offered to fix. She brought out a side of mashed pots, which were delicious. The BBQ pork was smoky and tender. Other entrees on offer were the mushroom enchiladas, which were cheesy and delicious, and the jambalaya, which had a nice heat and \"looked like they got it right\" (from the POV of my Louisianan SO). Nice healthy portions for the restaurant week menu. We even had some left to take home for lunch the next day.  3rd - Banana pudding. Also GF, except for the cookie, which I offered to my dinner companions. Delicious pud with a hint of cinnamon. Nice fresh way to end the meal.  Excellent service, great atmosphere (feels like you're outside, with the big windows and lots of seating room.) We went for Restaurant week and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if we just came on a bad night or what. But, based on the fact that the place was half empty on a Saturday night I think probably not. First off, let me say that the service was very good and the restaurant is very comfortable and nicely decorated. I tried several dishes, all of which I thought were mediocre or ...worse. The fried green tomatoes were over cooked and under seasoned. The pimento cheese that comes with it was just not right either. I had the broccoli and cauliflower casserole and I have to wonder why this is even on the menu? It was dry, bland and just plain not good. The chicken and biscuits were bland and the catfish dish as a whole seemed very disjointed. The red velvet cake was so sweet that it literally made my teeth hurt. It was also oddly crunchy (?). For someplace that is charging exceptionally high prices, I would expect that the chef would at least be able to use salt correctly. I can usually forgive mediocre food when the prices are reasonable, but I left here feeling like I really got ripped off."}
{"text":"I've been to Southern Rail a few times.  Each time we have had great service and the food is always perfect, my personal favorite is the gumbo. They also have a great social hour (happy hour) and on Sunday and Monday's they have 1/2 off AZ wines!"}
{"text":"One of the best things ever is to see talented people develop a new concept, plan it with care, and execute it masterfully.  When the buzz began months ago about Chef Beckett and partners, Katie and Scott Stephens, wanting to bring a southern flair to the area, Peg and I were all in.  That the new place was going to be at the site of a landmark (Beef Eaters Restaurant) with its own history of fine food was a nice touch. This is not Beckett's Table West...the concept is totally different. The fried green tomatoes and dirty rice croquettes were spot on.  The tomato tart and the house smoked trout appetizers were addictive, inventive and wonderfully balanced. A grilled watermelon salad was a light refreshing bite. As you would expect, all things pork were terrific, and Rail's cider brined pork loin was amazing. Ditto the crispy duck leg confit. The BLT salad was very tasty but the other apps were better yet. Making the call to try their gumbo (ya ya style) and BBQ shrimp was mandatory, and they were full of flavor, not obnoxiously hot like some \"Cajun style\" dishes out there have become. I strongly recommend wearing something that will handle butter and sauce well from the shrimp. Limitless napkins are provided...  Staples like mac and cheese, collards, and brioche with apple butter (think Parker House rolls) were very good. Beignets were authentic and pillowy. Even with it being opening night and week, the service (Jerod (hopefully not misspelled too badly) and Sarah were attentive and very helpful. Front of the house was welcoming. With concepts and execution like this, I frankly don't care \"what the fox say!\""}
{"text":"Everything was great! Ordered the steak and my knife literally felt like it was cutting through butter. Meat was thick but soft, vegetables were well cooked and the service was great. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The best southern food ever!  Grits were amazing, fried green tomatoes, brioche with apple jam, fried okra, amazing!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time for a date night and really enjoyed it! The ambience wasn't quite what I would have expected for evening dining, they have a lot of spot lights and didn't dim the lights after the sun went down so it didn't quite have that \"romantic\" feel. With that being said, the service was good outside of a longer than expected wait on our food. The couple that came in after us got their food quite a bit before we did. Thankfully our fried green tomatoes appetizer was delicious and held us over. My BF got the fried chicken which had the perfect breading along with a small piece of corn on the cob and mashed potatoes. I got the smoked chicken and dumplings which tasted amaaaazing! We didn't have dessert, but I've been told by others is great too. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I don't really get this place. It's absolutely lovely, the location is awesome, and if you want to grab lunch and then browse books, you would be wise to try this place.  But the food...? I am not a picky eater by a long shot but I found this menu limited and unappealing. I finally chose the BLT salad, but it was way overthought--a hunk of iceberg topped with tomatoes and bacon and, it seems, barbecue sauce? It was not the light lunch I anticipated.  The fried green tomatoes appetizer was kind of good but similarly overwrought, what with the pimiento spread.  Our (adorable) waiter explained that the food concept was \"Southern but not really Southern\" and I guess I would have to agree with that. I hail from south of the Mason Dixon, and this strikes me as food that some Yankee on a highfalutin cooking show would think is Southern.  I am not at all tempted to return, at least until they round out the menu with some more solid, traditional, Southern-inflected classics."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner starting with the gumbo which was delicious. Next I had the pork loin which is a very large piece and very tender. You could have cut it with a fork. The pork sat on a bed of sweet potatoes with a few greens.   The area is unique with a few stores to shop next to the restaurant.  Service was friendly and attentive. We will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me with the low rankings? This place served me the best steak I've had in Phoenix, with perfect vegetables and smashed potatoes. The waiter was terrific, helping me find the right Cabernet for my tastes and was efficient and friendly. Also had a very nicely dressed Simple Salad. Great ambiance in the patio by the fire."}
{"text":"Such an uncomfortable experience here. Food was so so, service was slow but friendly, but I had to witness the manager berating an adjacent table of diners, basically calling them idiots and saying \"just do the math\". I sure hoped there wasn't a dispute on my bill, although I now see other reviews on here that say they were charged for drinks they didn't order. The diners seemed like calm people rationally trying to settle an issue.  Management should not be berating their customers - they should be polite in settling a dispute. The manager created such a scene I was hoping he would be escorted out to avoid further escalation. No chance of enjoying the meal or the ambience after witnessing that. It was like being trapped in the middle of someone else's family argument. The diners remained polite throughout. My sympathies to anyone here who has a question about their bill. I will certainly not return."}
{"text":"We came to check it out expecting something moderately priced with good options. We got over priced, low quality ribs, and a vegetable dish I could've made at home for $1.99 ...and this was after staring at a menu for ten minutes that certainly needed more food choices on the other side instead of an (ahem) overpriced wine list. The bookstore/bar next door is great. Skip the restaurant and fill up on brownies and stouts instead. Oh, and it's loud. Super loud. Loud as balls."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with great patio seating. Nothing on the menu is jaw dropping delicious. I would come here more for the ambient and the drinks!"}
{"text":"There is nothing I dislike more than being told that the item on the menu that I just ordered is not available. If an item in on the menu, it needs to be available. It's not a special...it's a regular menu item. Yesterday, the tomato and onion tart was not available.  Although the food is delicious it is INCREDIBLY OVERPRICED. I ordered an $11 salad that filled half a salad-sized plate. My husband ordered the Monday special and paid $18 for about 1 1/2 cups of beans and rice and a single andouille sausage. It's not that these are expensive ingredients or huge portions, thus the large price tag. They are simply using a much bigger multiplier than other restaurants. It's just not worth it. Most people will feel they are being taken advantage of, unfortunately. When you see an $11 salad on the menu, you expect it to be a meal-sized salad, not a side dish."}
{"text":"A fabulous surprise! I loved Southern Rail! Their food was great and it was served with a side of the best southern hospitality I've experienced this far West.   Their happy hour menu is excellent and their food is fresh and savory.  I'm hooked to the kale and barley salad.  I plan on making this a regular spot for me as it is close to home and the lightrail."}
{"text":"Lovely space, excellent server, great sweet tea, good vibe. Po boy veg was great. Grilled watermelon salad was an unexpected treat. No room for a sticky bun....next time!"}
{"text":"Birthday dinner for our best friend now has to be rescheduled. We did not like the waitress from the beginning, she was too good for us! Thought the dirty rice balls were just okay. The fried chicken was overcooked on the outside, good on the inside. Definitely not what was expected. Red Velvet cake was good, not great! Very disappointing evening! Won't try again."}
{"text":"So I usually love this place! Tonight I ordered for takeout. I got the fried chicken dinner and the pork loin. Everything was great except the fried chicken. It was our first time and it seemed like it was mostly batter and it tasted burnt. On top of that all four pieces  were still red. Very sad, since I spent $70 bucks on dinner."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times now and have not been dissapointed!  Brunch Croque Mansieur! OO LA LA OMG! Heaven on a plate, the bechamel is so good and the ham is a little sweet, the tomato really balances the dish. I ordered the Poached egg on top it was perfect!   The Gumbo is delish the smokey sausage and the head on shrimp set this chicken gumbo up. It's one of the best gumbo's I've ever eaten. I really reminds me of our trip to New Orleans. Only thing missing was a piece of French bread to get every drop out of my bowl!  My mother had the Cuban po boy it wasn't what I expected from a Po boy but very good.   The grilled watermelon salad is amazing! The wedge was equally delicious! We had Beniets and Cafe Au lait yummmmmmmmm!  The shrimp and cheesy grits were so creamy and flavorful will definately have this dish again. I think a little larger portion and again a piece of bread or a bisquit to go with it.   I really love how they revitalized the old Beefeaters! It is a really great space and what Beckett has done here definately turns heads. It is a fun rustic kinda sexy open space.   The only draw back in my opinion is we were pestered by a few fly's that should be addressed and I would like to see the shrimp and grits be a larger portion. Other than that Bravo! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was nice. Pork loin was very good and kale salad was pretty good. Overall most dishes were average. Drinks were reasonable but this place doesn't compare to its sister restaurant beckett table and they ran out of 4 things at 8pm on Saturday night...come on..."}
{"text":"A very unique menu full of amazing stuff.  We have yet to find anything we didn't love.  This is a foodies restaurant and if you like different and unique cuisine, you have found the spot.  As a chef myself I thought it was a bit over priced for what we had and given the location as well as the noise from pretty bad acoustics, I feel I have to hold back one star though I will be going back.  Our waiter was attentive, honest about likes and dislikes and really knew the menu.  In all it was a great experience but plan on spending some money."}
{"text":"We just returned from dinner at Southern Rail and I am one happy 'effin customer!    I sit here typing in a post-grazing, satisfied, slightly-smug, aura of contentment. I have never eaten \"down south\", but if this is how good it can be, then I wanna' move south!  The building is big and bustling, with a good mix of metal and wood and cool light fixtures and stuff.  It was hot outside, but the AC cooled off the inside to a very comfortable level.  There are big doors that open to a nice patio.  When we come back we will check it out.  Since it was Father's Day (a special occasion!), we went all out and the three of us tried almost everything on the menu. .Among the appetizer and salad stars were Fried Green Tomatoes, Croquettes, Gumbo, a cool salad of watermelon and peach.  They were all good, and the croquettes were so good that my wife and I had to rock-paper-scissor for the last one.  I won, but my wife then proved that although rock-beats-scissors, fork-beats-wrist, and she got the last croquette.    For entrees we tried the peel-'n-eat shrimp which were fun and flavorful, the duck confit which was FANTASTIC and an order of ribs which rocked!  the table beside us ordered pork-loin which (although we didn't actually try it) looked and smelled great.  I read that some folks think the place is noisy, and the place is lively and high-energy, but certainly not as bad as others have indicated.  I politely suggest that those folks should wear thick wool sweaters and Snuggies to help with the acoustics.  We met one of the owners there (he recommended the wine we had) and the Chef/owner visited our table and asked how everything was.  We admitted that we were new to the genre of southern cooking, but he shared the story of how the menu came to be, and the cultures behind it.  I guess I never realized the precision that goes into classic, comfort food.  My wife and her friend had the beignettes (spelling?) which they liked and I had a slice of sweet and savory dessert that was a cool balance like an Arnold Palmer (iced tea / lemonade blend).  Southern Rail made some new fans tonight... congrats on the new place!"}
{"text":"Took the risk of going opening night, and it was well worth it!   We decided on several small plates since it was our first time:  Fried Green Tomatoes- Good enough, the pimento cheese that came with it was tasty. Would have liked a larger portion of greens.  House Smoked Trout- My favorite! All the flavors really worked wonderfully together, the trout, sweet pea cakes, and tomato jam. Peas are usually so boring, but I love them like this! I would get this again as a meal with a side salad.  Grilled Watermelon Salad- My other favorite dish along with the trout. A lot of flavors going on, but it works beautifully. The pea tendrils on top lend a real bright green taste to the whole dish. Truly a perfect summer salad. I would order it again.  Mac and Cheese- Disappointing, arrived cold. M&C should only be piping hot. It was served in a shallow bowl. Perhaps served straight from the oven in a tiny crock would be better. As for flavor, very sharp mustard/horseradish taste to it that you can sense even as you bring the fork up to your mouth. While chewing you do get some of mild, creamy cheese taste, but it was lost. My dining partner and I agreed that you can't really call this dish M&C, more like \"creamy pasta.\"  Cornbread Muffins- We only got these because they sold out of what we originally ordered, the brioche \"pull apart\" rolls. I have never in my life had cornbread wow me, and these were no exception. I did enjoy the black pepper honey butter that came with them.  I will be back for sure to try more of the salads, and I have my eye on the catfish stew, the chicken & dumplings, and those brioche rolls we missed out on!  As for service, we were quoted a ~40 minute wait when we arrived, and that is exactly what we waited. I love when that happens! Good thing that Changing Hands is next door, so we were able to browse and kill the time. You could even get a beer or wine at the First Draft Book Bar while you wait! You could get drinks at Southern Rail's bar too but it was tiny and crowded.  Our waiter met expectations. He was able to answer all of our questions about the food, and kept our drinks full. I initially ordered a tropical iced tea, but he convinced us both to get the strawberry/peach tea. While it was a refreshing beverage, it was red, with a taste very reminiscent of kool-aid, and no tea flavor at all. I am still not clear if they have actual unsweetened black tea available.  The space is beautiful and I am happy to have a new option for casual dinners in the neighborhood!"}

{"text":"I just ate a Sunday night fried chicken dinner at Southern Rail.  Which is funny because when they opened up, like 18 months ago, I thought, I gotta go eat \"REAL\" southern fried chicken.  Now, I cannot cite what that is, exactly, but there's going to be a difference between Popeye's and real southern fried chicken.   God, was this good.  Really, really, good.  Friendly people, I ate at the bar, waiters came by, bartender very nice.  The order was quite big actuallty.  I always think a nice restaurant, 2 pieces of chicken, mashed pats, $25 is a rip, and it is!  I'm tempted to say this order was huge: four, nice sized pieces.  SO (heat) HOT!  The breast boneless, the crust absolutely delicious!  Again, very, very moist, tender, HOT, absolutely delicious...and I noticed a hint of sweetness....was it in the crust or the chicken?  Hmmmm.  I'll have to go back and study it.  Stuffed, it was well worth the $20.  The bartender said the cider brined pork loin was also quite good.    I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great good, great atmosphere, great service awesome jambalaya and jazz music. We'll definitely return."}
{"text":"The chicken and dumplings are EXCELLENT. I highly recommend. The surroundings and décor are very welcoming. I can't say the same for the staff. I sat at the bar and felt like the staff were more interested in talking to one another than the patrons. I'll be back for the food and even recommended the place to a friend while eating there."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. The food was great. Interesting take on southern comfort food. My husband got biscuit & gravy and gumbo. They were both amazing. The chicken & biscuit had  an Asian twist, served stew like. Gumbo was amazing with andouille sausage.  For dessert we had beignets. They were almost as good cafe du monde.  Perfect ending to a great meal. Lunch menu is much smaller than the dinner menu. Will go back to try dinner next time."}
{"text":"Was not disappointed.  Sitting at the bar now closing out our tab, wish I could start from the beginning.  Food was scrumptious,  and service gold star!"}
{"text":"Southern Rail is Top on my Scale!  Kudos to Chef Justin Beckett, Southern Rail's Foodist Awards 2013 Top Chef who made it Food and Wine's Places to Eat in Phoenix and Zagat's #1 of 11, not to mention #8 restaurant on Seftel's top 10 and his staff!  But the awards are meaningless lest the eatery equals the significance of the honors - and by Jove the \"Rail\" does just that.  Since moving to the area, I had been hankering for some really good comfort vittles, refreshing Southern cuisine that is, and Restaurant Week helped make that happen!  Our weekly date night at the Southern Rail recently was started with a fantastic local wine, a Lawrence Dunham Vineyards Viognier 2012.  A wine rendition bringing back memories of the lush Viogniers we enjoyed while living in Virginia.  This version is full bodied yet with a lush and easy character are expressed the apparent longer growing seasons in Arizona.  With the wine, we began the incredible tastings with their cornbread muffins made with black pepper and honey butter - an incredible muffin.  For starters, we gave in to ordering \"Rail's\" appetizers of a great tasting and extremely well prepared fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese and pea tendrils and their smoked chicken and andouille gumbo ya ya with white rice and green onions - a fanciful rendition of a southern standard.  I loved every single spoonful - I was sorry it was gone so soon.  For the main courses, my wife thoroughly enjoyed the Grand mama's Meatloaf - my wife summing it up best said... \"this has been the best meatloaf I've ever had!\"  Meanwhile, I had the brilliantly prepared portion of cider brined pork loin served over brown butter whipped nicely sweet potatoes, sided by very nicely prepared collard greens - no, not vinegary.  We both enjoyed a sampling of their home-made \"super\" creamy grits.  So much enjoyed, that I can honestly say, I cannot remember when was the last time I had them this good.  I even asked for the recipe nicely, but was courteously denied access to it - 'bummer'!  We finished off the meal with an order of beignets with powdered sugar.  I must say though, that of the total delightful dinner extravaganza, only the beignets were not what we expected - but nobody can be perfect!  For anyone who has a love of Southern Cuisine, whether as comfort food or nouveau cuisine, Southern Rail will astonish your taste buds.  The location is a fabulous piece of restoration, redesign and history along with a comfortable, homey and yet modern atmospheric approach that is desirable, laid-back, and aesthetically pleasing to both the ambiance and comfort!  The initial views on approaching the location, is as if reaching a circa 1950's new drive-in-style structure, but once inside, everything from the incredible bar area, to the tables and seating areas, not to mention their airy and nicely landscaped and appointed outdoor area are fabulous and appealing.  Their desire to combine great food, great atmosphere, great service and great ambience has been flawlessly accomplished, and reserves us the right to continue to frequent this Chef's Masterpiece.  Chef Beckett and Staff, please continue to amaze the Gourmét and the Novice of your splendid artistry, as we plan to continue to enjoy it.  Gástro Ecléctico rates Southern Rail at the top of the heap.  Bon appétit ya'll!"}
{"text":"So disappointed with our visit here. The service was slow, got charged for a drink we did not have (Noticed on the drive home so no recourse), and the food was really not good. I was just trying to eat my leftovers and had to toss them, and I must say, the Cuban Po' Boy was the worst sandwich I have had at any decent establishment in AZ. Went with four friends for a birthday celebration and we were all like \"this place has great reviews\" when we sat down. Then at the end of the meal we all met eyes and were like \"well, that sucked\". I am sure you know the feeling. The Cuban was mushy shaved pork on a Fry's quality sub roil. Wait, that may not be fair to Fry's. It had this thick greasy paste on it that was like glue, not grilled or prepped in any way. Not even as good as Subway, I kid you not. The hamburgers were small,  and our waiter never asked how we wanted them, they were all cooked to HE-- as a result. The only so-so thing was the grilled cheese but SO SMALL for the money. Thank God they had alcohol so we could pretend we didn't eat there. So hopeful before, so sad now."}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for Southern Rail. On the night I came we arrived a little before 6 so we elected to sit at the bar to take advantage of happy hour prior to eating.    The staff here hate each other.  Seriously, I've never seen a group of people with more vitriol in such a crammed space.  The 3 people working the bar took turns snipping and yelling at each other, arguing over who stocked what, and occassionally talking to customers to see if anything was needed.  There were two, a very skinny young lady and a younger guy with a hipster combover that HAD to have dated at some point.  The tension between them was uncomfortable.  I was waiting for him to ask for vodka and have her respond \"why, so you can just stick it in every drink that walks by??\"  But I digress.  The food was av-er-age.  For a place that claims to have roots in the low country of Charleston, it was very disappointing.  It seemed everything lacked seasoning.  If I could describe the food in one word, it'd be \"bland.\"    The prices were reasonable and the outdoor patio/bar area is very cool.  I wanted to like it but i was let down.  I wouldn't go back on my own but if a group chose to go here, I'd go along to give it another try."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Phoenix! The atmosphere is sophisticated but comfortable. The drinks are on point, try the Medlock by Moonlight!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Fried chicken was black on the inside of the breading interestingly enough, and the scorched flavor carried through the chicken.   I would have asked the manager about it, but he wasn't doing table checks. The server didn't come back until after plates were cleared.   The greens are on the same plate as the chicken, so if you are looking for crispy fried chicken, you might want them plated separately.   The Camelback salad was good. The deviled eggs really lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Three-and-a-half-star average, you say? I don't get it! The food looks good in the pictures. But I guess we'd have to dine here for ourselves to really find out.  Southern Rail has been on our list since it first opened. I'm constantly passing by on Camelback and always notice that the place looks busy. I had high hopes that the restaurant would become a \"new favorite\" in our ongoing quest of expanding our food horizons in Phoenix.  On this particular Saturday night during prime-dining hours, the patio was packed, but the interior was scarcely filled. There was no wait time and we were seated at a nice, round booth that gave us full view of the entire restaurant. I must say, I do like the setup of SR, with its wood ceiling and giant umbrellas, which reminded my girlfriend of our trips to Coronado.  My girlfriend ordered a herbal strawberry-peach tea, in a desire to be like those crazy southerners that hang around on their porch in wooden rocking chairs drinking their sweet teas to pass time. We both found it to be incredibly weak, which is often the case with these herbal teas. No amount of sweetener seemed to help, so she kindly told the server it was not what she was expecting (i.e. big letdown). He was kind enough to let her swap it out for a honey lemonade, which was much more her style, as well as mine.  We ordered some fried green tomatoes to start. Despite my Midwestern upbringings, I'd never tried them before. Served with some semi-spicy pimento cheese, you're given four thin slices of locally grown tomato. They were okay, but definitely not worth the ten-dollar asking price, in my opinion.  My girlfriend ordered the fried chicken. It comes with a generous portion of chicken, covering the wing, breast, and leg - which has always been my preferred part of the bird. We can appreciate great fried chicken, but this simply just wasn't up to par. As another Yelp review states, the batter they use has more of that heavy \"cornmeal\" texture, so it's very crumbly (think shake and bake). There is no satisfying crunch and the batter itself falls apart while eating it. Although some people might disagree, the batter is the most crucial part to good fried chicken, which we felt came up way short. Furthermore, the mashed potatoes were barely warm, while the miniature corn cob wasn't anything special.  In addition to the fried chicken, I ordered a broccoli, cauliflower, and leek casserole dish which was okay for what it was - but probably not something I'd order again.  As for sides, we opted for some mac and cheese. They offer up a very generously sized portion of pigtail mac that includes some cornmeal crumbs. Once again, it was just okay, but not really anything memorable when we know that superior mac can easily be obtained elsewhere. The cornbread muffins were a bit of a disappointment as well. Some people like corn coronels to be baked into the bread itself, but I've always felt it reminds me too much of those disgusting corn soufflés people would bring to church potlucks I'd attend growing up. We prefer sweet cornbread, but I got scolded once on Yelp for saying this, being told that sweet cornbread is not authentic - so I'll just simply say that while there was nothing wrong with it, we just simply didn't like it.  In the end, we decided to pass on dessert. Given that virtually nothing we ate here really impressed us, I seriously doubt a dessert would have been their saving grace.  After dining here, I now fully understand why the place only maintains a 3.5 star rating. Too much money for food that, although generously sized, just wasn't up to our standards for good southern food - especially when we know of places that serve it for much, much cheaper (and better).  I suppose it's worth trying out at least once - which was more than enough for us, sadly."}
{"text":"Shrimp po'boy was  Iced tea was great as well Service 4 stars German chocolate cake was really good but a bit dry. Not dry enough you couldn't eat though!"}
{"text":"Very nice  evening tonight at Southern Rail, delicious southern-inspired food, great atmosphere. Quite impressed with the entire place having hit the ground running after only a couple of days. The space is beautifully designed with interesting touches, and is slightly elevated from Camelback road which gives it a nice view of the surrounding area (without the sometimes grimy reality of west camelback road). Extensive beer selection with some southern favorites, as well as a wine list that should suit anyone. The menu is southern, so if you're looking to go \"light\" you might be better off elsewhere. We had the tomato and bacon tart which was decadent. We also had the gumbo which had perfectly smoky flavor and a not too thick roux. We did not think the three tiny head-on shrimp were worth the $6 supplement, however. Finally, the pork loan was delicious with a smoky, candied flavor and delicious sweet potatoes. Desserts looked wonderful but we couldn't muster another bite. A couple of kinks with service and timing that we can overlook because it has been open less than a week, but overall a wonderful night at a place that is definitely on our rotation from here on! Excited to try the rest of the menu, as we'll be back many times."}
{"text":"This is my third time dining at Southern Rail, though the first time for brunch.  I've never been overwhelmed with the food here, partially because many of the true southern options aren't available to be made gluten free (a must for me).  The brunch menu isn't very extensive, with most items requiring you add protein for an additional cost. I ordered the sweet potato hash. The helping was decent, though it was a lot of filler, whereas I would have preferred another egg and more bacon included in the hash. Additionally, the hash itself was very soupy, with a lot of soggy liquid remaining at the end.   This wouldn't be a top brunch choice for me."}
{"text":"We've visited here several times and it's always been a great experience.  Every single worker is unfailingly polite, attentive and helpful.   I dream of their corn bread and dirty rice ball appetizers.  So amazing!"}
{"text":"I loved every minute of it. It is a true dining experience. The service was spot on, and the Fried green tomatoes were AMAZING!!!!!!!!! This was a fine dining experience with expert and experienced chefs in the back. Their twist on \"Southern Food\" is amazing. The servers are experts and know the food, ingredients and how it is prepared. The Pork Loin was perfection, and the Bread Pudding is to DIE for (sorry G'Ma). Cant wait until patio season has returned to Phoenix, so I can enjoy their beautiful patio."}
{"text":"Southern Rail has taken a twist on the $20/pizza-wine night that you'll find at plenty of places around the Valley.  On Monday and Tuesday nights, you can opt in on their BBQ & Bourbon pairing.  It's an amazing concept, that is subsequently equally delicious!  You get 2 glasses of bourbon (or bourbon cocktail - I had the Medlock by Moonlight which is mixed with homemade honey syrup and fig bitters.. super tasty), plus a large plate of BBQ food for $20.  The BBQ plate changes daily (our plate consisted of a large smoked pork shank, local farmers sausage, cheesy potatoes, pickled vegetables, and a piece of cornbread...an incredible amount of food!) and is literally lick-your-fingers good :)    And beyond that, the restaurant just has a very fun, chill atmosphere about it.  We sat out on the patio, and had a phenomenal time.  Plus, our server was very attentive and was very excited about the food, which in turn made us enjoy the experience even more.  We are all in for Southern Rail, and cannot wait for our return visit on their next BBQ adventure!"}
{"text":"Went for a double birthday, last minute, eight of us, service was great and amazing food. We had the okra, smoked trout and fried tomatoes to start and loved them all. Entrees were varied from the best fried chicken for two of us, duck, catfish, pork loin, chicken and dumplings and jumbalaya, all were really well prepared and delicious. Then dessert OMG the red velvet cake and bienyets. Wonderful and they comped our desserts. Our waiter was funny, friendly and attentive. Definitely will be back. Enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I always go for BBQ night. It's on Monday and Tuesday. It's a flat fee comes with dinner and drinks. You have to ask for it.   I've had some amazing dishes. Smoked pork and chicken and beef. The sides are always yummy and the bourbon on point.   This time I tried the deviled eggs and gumbo. Both are fantastic."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very cool.  We had a sampler appetizer that had some delicious  tomato jam, bacon jam and cream cheese pimento spread, awesome!  Then we waited about 45 minutes for our dinner.  We ordered ribs & fried chicken, they said they were out of fried chicken but we saw others served after us.  The ribs were amazing but the smoked chicken (which was suggested in place of the fried chicken) was strange.  I don't know if I will come back but it was fun to venture out."}
{"text":"Of course,  the food here is divine. Everything was absolutely delicious. What really touched me about this place,  however, was the service. Our waiter, Josh,  recognized that my dad doesn't speak English and he spoke to him in spanish! This was really special for me and so touching that not only did he know how to speak Spanish (he was clearly not latin-american),  but he made the effort to make my father feel comfortable and included. The waiters and waitresses here are seasoned professionals. It's evident that they're there because it's what they like to do, not because it's their crappy part-time job. Josh took the time to get on one knee and play with my son's toy,  we never had a dirty plate on our table for longer than about a minute before he picked it up, my delicious lemonade was constantly refilled,  and my father always had a beer in front of him. I just can't say enough about this place. A real Phoenix treasure."}
{"text":"Great food & excellent service combined with a good location next to Changing Hands make this a restaurant to visit"}
{"text":"Eaten here 7 or 8 times, quality of food is usually good but consistency and service is all over the place. On several occasions food items have been forgotten and never delivered. Another occasion saw entrees forgotten completely and were later given to us to go . I've had several dishes multiple times, the salmon, and the gumbo are most inconsistent, sometimes portion size will be literally half of what it was on a previous visit, the gumbo will go from thick and hardy, to watery and insignificant. We keep giving it chances in hopes things will even out, so far still waiting."}
{"text":"finally got here last night, and it was fantastic.   the BBQ & Bourbon monday/ tuesday special was a spectacular deal, and everything we tried was delicious. the staff was super friendly and helpful and for a 'nice' restaurant the prices were solid. i will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Location is alright, seeing that it's right across from the light rail but the place is beautiful. Set up is nice with the fireplace outside but that's about it. The food was such a disappointment. I had the steak and not only was it a bit dry, but it was surrounded in a pool of vomit sauce. My friend and I decided to give them one more shot and ordered dessert. It took nearly 25 minutes for our dessert to come out.   To top it off, food is unnecessarily overpriced. Never going back."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant by chance and decided to try it out.  Mainly because it was a busy Saturday night and I found an empty parking space.  I love the decor and the ambiance.  I am big on those 2 things and it will most likely have me giving them another try.   Honestly I had a good experience but the food was very lack luster.  I ordered the Camelback Salad and while 'good' it really wasn't anything special.  Steamed green beans, roasted chicken, a few corn kernels, butternut squash (not sure how it was cooked.  One of my favorite things about roasted squash is the awesome caramelizing you get when roasting.  This literally had no flavor), and bacon.  The best thing was the dressing which is yummy but very garlicky.   I love the concept.  But as I was sitting there contemplating what I would order at another visit everything passing by on plates looked unappealing for the prices listed on the menu.  The fried chicken looked good but I never order that!  Maybe it's just not my type of place.  Which is sad cause I loved the vibe!"}
{"text":"Fat Tuesday I came in to this restaurant looking for some good southern cooking with my grandmother. I've grown up with southern food my whole life since my family is from Memphis. Unfortunately, they weren't starting their Fat Tuesday specials till three which I feel is a missed opportunity to the lunch time crowd like myself.  My sever was very nice and attentive which was great. I ordered the fried green tomatoes which were pretty good, the pimento cheese spread really kicked them up a notch. My grandmother and I each ordered a po'boy, I got the cat fish and my granny got the beef.  When I went to order my side of collard greens I asked for some pepper vinegar on the side to dash in then. I was SHOCKED to hear that they didn't have any. Why would you serve greens and not have pepper vinegar?! That's like ordering Mac and cheese without cheese. So I didn't put up to much of a fuss and let them come as they were, with hot sauce on them. When my food got there and I finally tasted some of it, I was disappointed. The catfish in my po'boy had no seasoning, which is dumb because catfish is a bland flavorless fish, it needs at least salt. On top of that both my grand ma and I both agreed that these were the MESSIEST po'boy a we've ever eaten. The waiter had to bring us extra napkins. Despite the fuss about the pepper vinegar my green were alright, they were rich and almost buttery, however I did still wish I had the vinegar to give them the right kick. My grandmothers beef po'boy was great except all you could taste was the horse radish. Overall, the experience was okay I guess. I probably won't return because nothing was especially good to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"My family came into the valley for a visit and so we decided to try an off chain restaurant. Southern Rail did not disappoint. The service was GREAT! Our waiter was knowledgeable and friendly. I had the strawberry peach tea and Camelback salad. I would definitely order that again. However, my parents ordered the Smoked trout and the entree was said to be big and fulfilling, but that was not the case. 13 bucks for that. No thank you."}
{"text":"Redemption. I returned to the scene of the crime tonight for carry-out and learned that the crew at Southern Rail: (a) Pays attention to Yelp reviews; and (b) cares about what they do. The same bar tender from last week's visit somehow connected the dots from that misadventure to tonight's order. After welcoming me back, he confirmed that my last visit was not a good good one-- then handed tonight's order to me and said it was on the house! Truth be told, I don't write negative reviews in order to get free stuff-- I'm happy to pay for good food and service. However, when a kind & generous gesture is offered, it does make an impact. Well done; we'll obviously be back regularly."}
{"text":"I was there last night  with a party of four and three of us ordered the fried chicken. I just read from another reviewer that they threw away the batter since it was not done right, but I guess the three of us had it before it was thrown away! The chicken had no taste; no spice and no sour and tasted plain and  tasteless! It was our first time for dinner there and we  were really disappointed!  On person  had the salmon and  said it was good and I can say that the fried green tomatoes and the deviled eggs were excellent.   Very uneven and if I am back it will be for appetizers only."}
{"text":"Went here for Jazz, food & beverage Sunday 5pm. Absolutely horrible food, poor service. My guest had eaten in many southern style restaurants & she agreed the food was horrible. We ordered Dirty Rice Balls (I thought mediocre she thought horrid), Jambalaya (we both agreed it was terrible & tasted like they opened a can of gravy- we barely touched it & the server did not ask why), Fried Green Tomatoes (tasteless, bland & cream cheese sauce was overpowering & not complimentary. Green tomatoes seemed not freshly batted but frozen & pre-breaded), a Simple Salad (difficult to mess this up, but overly average). Service at the bar was slow & we had to ask for more drinks, nobody asked us. Even with live jazz the place was half full. Cocktails are not inexpensive & the bar mixology is far below average. Not sure how this place is still in business. Many other restaurants nearby with better food, better mixology & better happy hour prices. Too had because outside & bar environment is nice. Sad."}
{"text":"Had a team dinner at this place. I am not a big fan of southern cuisine with the exception of a few things . We ordered two shared appetizers , corn muffins, grilled cauliflower and fried okra. Muffins were a bit dry, but tasted great. The other two appetizers were average and didn't have any southern flair. I noticed many classic southern entrees but ordered salmon. Some of my team members got the brined pork loin  , veggie casserole and avocado toast. Pork was moist and cooked right. Casserole was loaded with cheese. Salmon was perfectly seared but the  spinach and cauliflower side was bland. The finale was the beignets which looked like the original with the powdered sugar, but nothing close to Cafe Du Mondé.  Just another southern themed restaurant."}
{"text":"We started off with appetizers, fried green tomatoes, dirty rice balls and the deviled eggs all were amazing. For the lunch course my husband had the Shrimp Po'Boy with fries and I had the Chicken and Biscuit Dumplings. Flavor so we're on point.  We will definitely be returning on a regular basis, service was excellent and the atmosphere was very comfortable."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!   This was our first visit to Southern Rail. We had seen this restaurant on an episode of Check Please! Arizona so we decided to give it a try. We were ABSOLUTELY NOT DISAPPOINTED! The staff was very friendly and accommodating, the restaurant atmosphere was positive, everything including the restrooms were very clean.  The FOOD WAS OUTSTANDING!!! I've been to Tennessee plenty of times and this brought me back to visits with my great granny. We ordered the ribs and fried chicken but shared everything family style, the portions are huge. The fried Chicken was the best I have ever had; the outside was perfectly crunchy and the inside was juicy and very well seasoned. The ribs were unmatched by any other restaurant, the meat melted in your mouth and the sauce was so good I could drink it by itself. If that's not enough then you have the best mac n cheese and cornbread ever! I could go on and on, we just LOVED OUR EXPERIENCE!   So glad I starved all day for this I wasn't disappointed, you won't be either!  By the way we booked with Open Table and it worked we got our points, just FYI because another review said the system wasn't working for them."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood. I have been for brunch, lunch, dinner, and happy hour. I love the patio when it is nice out. They have a decent selection of beers and some good cocktails as well. I recommend the following items:  Appetizers: Fried Green Tomatoes, Rice Balls, Fried Okra. All of these are delicious and are discounted at social hour.  Mains: Red Beans & Rice, Gumbo Ya Ya, Fried Shrimp Po'Boy*  *lunch item  The service here is great, every server we have had has been very nice, knowledgable of the menu, and very helpful and accommodating with our 1 year old daughter (which we really appreciate and makes our dining experience great).  I love ambiance of the dining area. I had already mentioned the patio but I also love the main room. The building itself and the decorations really have a welcoming vibe. On top of that, there is a book bar right next to Southern Rail!   Overall I hope everyone gives this place a chance and enjoys it as much as I do."}
{"text":"This place has been on my bucket list for a while and finally made there a couple weeks ago for my birthday. I had never been there when it was Beefeaters, but my parents had and were impressed with what they had done with the place. It is a very trendy, hip place and has a great bar/patio.   Upon walking in, we were seated immediately as I had made a reservation on Open Table. However after about 10-12 minutes of waiting, our server had still not made an appearance. We flagged over the manager and informed him and after his apologies, our server was over within 2 minutes. The manager also notified us that all our desserts would be comped because of this as well as it being my birthday. This is an example of a restaurant going above and beyond and we had impeccable service the remainder of the night.   The food.....AMAZING! I've spent a lot of time in Georgia and Louisiana, so I always have a taste for Southern/Cajun, but it can be a little difficult to find in Arizona. We ordered:  Shrimp & Tomato Bisque and Simple Salad - both winners! Fried Chicken Pork Loin Macaroni & Cheese Red Beans & Rice - best I've found outside of New Orleans so far! Chicken & Grilled Andouille Gumbo Beignets - didn't want a whole plate, so the server ordered me just one which was plenty Butterscotch Banana Pudding German Chocolate Cake  Everything we ordered was great and there were no complaints from any of us. This place is more laid back and less stuffy then Beckett's Table so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place a five star because people have been pretty harsh on them...  Ok, so the service isn't AMAZING, but the food is! That's all I care about.   The service was really bad once, but the manager comped our meal...They care about customer service and it shows.   Atmosphere?...check.  Service?....check.. Great food?....check. Check?....ouch. Coulda ate at Mcdonalds like 5 times..."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely perfect, friendly and efficient but not overbearing. The atmosphere is warm, comforting and inviting just like their food. The food... Oh the food!! The passion for amazing food done right was apparent in ever single dish. This is the perfect place to take friends for happy hour or a date for dinner. My new favorite restaurant in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Had Mother's Day brunch a day early due to scheduling conflicts and we decided to try southern rail since it is new to us. Whether you sit inside or outside the flies will be an issue. The waiter was super sweet and he did a great job with the service. The problem lied with certain food items. My daughter got pancakes that were sticky and unsweetened with the batter. The watermelon salad was ok . It needed either goat cheese or feta to add a little depth. Don't add chicken to it. It didn't make it any better. The sticky buns and crab cakes were amazing. They have some items that are great, but overall it was a disappointment. The portions are way too small for what you pay and we went at brunch too"}
{"text":"In summary... our service was very good, the food was OK, and the space was cool with really interesting use of reclaimed architectural details.  However, as other reviewers have mentioned - IT IS REALLY LOUD.  It was rather challenging for our table of six people to have a meaningful conversation over the din of the bar and kitchen with nothing to absorb the sound.  To start off, we really enjoyed the fried green tomatoes with cheese spread, but the muffins were nothing to get too excited about.  I ordered the duck confit which came with collard greens, and it was excellent.  My boys ordered the ribs and declared that mine are way better.  Given that I only make them about once a year, I'm no expert.  However, I have to agree with them - they were rather unremarkable.  My wife seemed to like her watermelon salad with shrimp.  The 3 adults each had a glass of wine, we shared four appetizers and one desert, and each had an main course meal.  After tips I walked out with a wallet that was $300 lighter."}
{"text":"The food of the South is so rich in its own history and recipes that it even has its own cultural organization devoted to it, the Southern Foodways Alliance and anyone from that group, I believe, would be proud of the representation of this most uniquely American cuisine here at Southern Rails. Tucked away in a little shopping center with a Changing Hands bookstore with its own wine and beer bar and a gardening center this establishment is an oasis of generally good food and warm Southern Hospitality.  I took my father here yesterday for his 77th birthday and my mother, never one to pass up a good thing, came along as well. Though we are from Texas originally, and not the true South, we appreciate this more Louisiana inspired approach to food. We started with a sampler of spreads ranging from homemade pimento cheese (quite good, with a kick of spice to it, I think the one at La Grande Orange may be better but this was still delightful), bacon and caramelized onion jam (like an umami bomb to the senses) and tomato jam (sweeter than I expected). We also had a serving of fried okra for $6 and it was a surprisingly small serving, though good.   For the entrees we got a fried green tomato and pimento cheese po-boy (my favorite, ask and they will also put the bacon and onion jam on it), and the special of the day, a fried chicken po-boy, both of which came with homemade pickles on them and a litel pickled carrot that was rather delightful and reminded me of the lightly pickled veggies one sees in Japanese cuisine. In addition there was  a small side of gumbo made with a rich rue, as the gumbo was a lovely dark brown, chicken and andouille (smoked pork) sausage.   My father ordered the chicken and dumplings, or the variation at this establishment with pea shoots. I have to admit, it sort of threw of off as it doesn't look too much like traditional chicken and dumplings, but he said it was good. I recommend they shift this dish to a more traditional look and presentation but it is pretty, just not what I think most people expect.   For desert, because my father got to select one for free, we had the red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. Here it comes more more like a little cake and a bit drier than I would like, though the frosting was good. As with the pimento cheese I recommend the chefs at Southern Rail take a trip to La Grande Orange and compare as that establishment gets it right and folks, a slice please, of a regular looking cake. Sometimes a place can get too creative for its own good, i would say this is one of those times. I would love to see Southern Rails offer both a traditional red velvet and a carrot cake, and to complete the holy trinity of Southern deserts, some sort of banana pudding, if they don't already. As for their beignets, my mother walked by someone and they said the ones here are a bit doughy so as another field trip, I recommend the folks who run this place do a side jaunt to Clever Koi to have their banana fosters fritters. I think that is the sort of texture and look Southern Rails should go for.  Oh, final thoughts, my father and I had the cafe' au lait which the waiter noted was made with chicory coffee. I've had the beignets with cafe' au lait at Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans and the chicory flavor is much less strong than it is here. I think a little of that flavor would be nice but it was strong in mine that I couldn't finish it. So as with many places strong on the appetizers and the meals are rather good but when it comes to desert and coffee I think Southern Rails has some work to do.  In summation, I do intend to go back and hopefully for the Wednesday Fried Chicken special and the one thing I did not do but will when I ride the rails, is to try one of their lovely looking cocktails. Maybe Sunday will be a good day to go sit on the veranda and sip a hush puppy hush.Oh, and the wait service, amazing. We had the nicest waiter and I wish I had taken down his name so we could give him a shout out but honestly, he helped make for a great dining experience and tipped accordingly!  Good luck Southern Rail and I hope your take those recommendation for some visits to other establishments in the spirit in which they are given, just a desire to see a good restaurant become even better.  Oh, p.s. - as someone else mentioned, the locking mechanism on the bathrooms is confusing, might you consider putting a sliding bolt lock on the bathroom doors? I can promise you, an extremely traditional way to keep the bathroom closed in the South. ;-)"}
{"text":"The cider pork loin with mashed sweet potatoes and kale was great. The grits were unlike anything I had ever had before. Good cocktails too. Pricy, but worth it I think. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"All in all, the Southern Rail is a good time. Not spectacular, not amazing....just good.  I ordered the Creole lemonade. It hinted at greatness but the heat could definitely afford to be amped up and the sweetness of the lemonade was a little much at times.  I had the ribs and they had good and not so good points. The sauce was not much better than bottled but the rib meat had great flavor and were very very tender. The pickled onion garnish needs to be more of a star on that plate. They were tangy and had more complexity than the BBQ sauce. The corn salad was a great way to cut through the sweetness of the BBQ sauce. The brioche rolls didn't make sense on the plate. Maybe with some butter on the side? If the BBQ sauce was thinner I could see sopping it up.   My husband had the Fried chicken. Here is where stars get taken away. The chicken skin/batter was odd. It was incredibly dry and tasted....old? It needed seasoning to liven it up.  The skin is the best part! It needs to have seasoning and there should be a hint of the grease it was fried in. The chicken itself was bland. If they brine their birds they need to get more aggressive with the salt in the brine.  If nothing else, offer up some hot sauce on the side. The mashed potatoes and corn were nothing out of ordinary.   I had the banana pudding for dessert. It had moments of greatness. The ginger snap cookie was a great counterpoint to the richness of the pudding.  The banana chips were pointless. The Nilla wafer crust was good but could have used some ginger in it.   Lose the banana chips and put a dollop of vanilla whipped cream on top and serve with two cookies and you have a winner.   The reason I give 3 stars is that the general vibe in Southern Rail is awesome. The patio is excellent and our waiter, Ty was great. The proximity of Changing Hands is a very nice treat for an after dinner stroll."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! The food is so good !!! Love the atmosphere and our server Thomas was excellent!! The meatloaf is delish! And the desserts were the bomb!! Everyone loved everything we ordered! And if you love bourbon they have quite the selection! Including Pappy VanWinkle 15 year!! We loved it and will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Check my other reviews - I don't give five stars very often. But everything about this place was really pretty darn perfect. I'm not from Phoenix, so i was very pleasantly surprised to walk up to the restaurant a little early, and be able to spend 20 minutes walking through the adjacent (connected?) used book store, while listening to live jazz music from the patio.   The interior decor is lovely. And I appreciated the blending between interior and patio spaces -- done not only with floor to ceiling doors, but also through a tight observation of the A/C -- the inside wasn't overly air conditioned, and they controlled air flow through the doors, so that everyone was comfortable.  But probably most importantly, the food, drink, and service was top-notch. We had a mixture of things, and everything was memorably delicious. Not a hiccup to be found. Thanks for the great evening!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time and had a great experience. It was Friday night and we got right in. Really nice decor.  Loved the sea scallop special. My wife enjoyed the veggie casserole. I am glad I ordered wine instead of ice tea because if they had brought me a sweet tea I would have spit it out.  We saved room for dessert. Red velvet cake is cute but nothing to rave about. Bread pudding is ok, certainly not special and looks like toast. But the sauce was yummy. Best part was our service. Everyone very friendly, waitress going over and above to make our first visit memorable. We shall return!!"}
{"text":"Positive: Nice decor. Seated right away. Not so positive: Let's start with cocktails. 9 dollars for cocktails. Not very good ones at that and they were very small. I am pretty sure there wasn't much for alcohol in the Austin Mule. I am a light weight and I didn't feel a thing. We ordered the appetizer fried green tomatoes.  They were just ok. Not great. If southern food is your thing then I think fried green tomatoes is something you should do absolutely amazingly.  They just weren't.  We opted not to order any more food because it was priced rather expensive from the start. Price is not an issue when you get value for your money, but when  there didn't seem to be much justifying the high prices we skipped the rest of meal. I am not sure if we will go back. It is disappointing because we high hopes for a new restaurant in the neighborhood.  On a positive note, go have a glass of wine at the cute bookstore next to the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is OK, very cool atmosphere, wanted more out of the food.  Fried Okra and gumbo, I was excited.  Food came out to meet expectations but nothing to write home about.  Gumbo was more or less bland, same for the okra.   Service was strong and the location is cool.  I would go back for drinks, maybe need to do some more exploration on the menu.  Cool location near Camelback and Central with light rail running right in front.  Food presentation was on point as well.  Probably worth a try ."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time for lunch. Didn't realize the brunch menu didn't have fried chicken so I was kind of disappointed with that. I ended up getting the shrimp po boy with a side of gumbo ($14). The meal just...wasn't for me. I did enjoy the beignets($8) though. They were nice and hot. They're pretty big too. Our server Thomas was nice though."}
{"text":"Great service and very delicious and unique food. Get here right when they open, you get in right away. If you do get a wait changing hands book store is a great place to pass the time."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place forever!  I'm a huge fan of Beckett's Table and I couldn't wait to finally give Southern Rail a try.  We came for a late brunch on Sunday of Memorial Day weekend.  We were able to snag a table outdoors.  It's equipped with the typical misters to battle the AZ heat.  The vibe is pretty cool and surprisingly quiet for the amount of commotion going on.  It sits right now Camelback and the outdoor sitting area is adjacent to the parking lot.  Our server, Casey, was extremely attentive--like fine dining attentive.  He helped me make a decision on what to order because I literally wanted everything, made sure our water was never empty, checked up on us and gave us new silverware between courses.    The food was pretty amazing.  I love southern food and could not wait to try the shrimp and grits!  But first, we started with the deviled egg and the beignets.  The deviled egg was pretty standard.  Honestly, I liked that they kept it simple.  Some restaurants try to get cute with the recipe when a deviled egg is really enough on its own--no fancy frill necessary.  I've had better beignets... in New Orleans.  Can you really go wrong with fried dough with powdered sugar?  I suppose you can but these were just fine.    My husband and I split the Fried Shrimp Po-Boy and the Shrimp and Grits.  The Po-Boy is served with a hot sauce mayo that is to die for!  I thought the pickle on the Po-Boy was slightly overpowering.  The pickle demanded a lot of attention, taking away form the other flavors BUT the pickle on it's own was great.  My husband love it all together, so it obviously depends on your personal tastes.  They have a few sides for you to choose from and we chose collard greens.  I have yet to go to a restaurant that can cook collard greens the way I like them (including Lo-Lo's).  Southern Rail nailed it!  They were perfect-- I almost ordered more.  It was the perfect amount of hot sauce and vinegar.    I'm really looking forward to visiting Southern Rail for Dinner in the near future!"}
{"text":"What gets five stars at Southern Rail? Absolutely everything. If anything, I'd fault them for being such a drive from my house. If we lived closer, we'd be here WEEKLY.  I made a Saturday reservation on a whim last week, and it was basically the best decision I've made all year. The space is Southern-classic-sleek (we found it reminiscent of The Henry) and very inviting. Service (we had Seth watching over us) was perfection. Wine and herbal iced tea was delicious. Food was transcendent.  The cornbread muffins with black pepper/honey butter (!!!) were perfect little bites. The kale and barley salad came with collard green pesto, roasted grapes (IMMEDIATE FAVORITE THAT I MUST RE-CREATE), orange segments and toasted candied pecans. So delicious; the texture contrasts were awesome. The edamame/corn/tomato/green bean/pepper/pea succotash was basically everything I need in my life. I believe I detected a sautee in white wine as the mysterious flavor undertone that made it SO. VERY. GOOD. Fiance had to go with the fried chicken and yes, this $20 fried chicken is worth it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied the four gigantic pieces were what dreams are made of.  If anything, my only regret is that we were too stuffed for dessert. I spied a brioche bread pudding (with *bourbon*sauce*!?) that we will absolutely get on our next visit. And there will be PLENTY of next visits!   Cheers, Southern Rail!"}
{"text":"Sub-par. By the looks of this place, I had very high expectations. Being here & experiencing it, I can't say I'll be back. Excellent atmosphere but very limited menu at high prices, not worth It. Drinks were good but it's hard to screw that up!"}
{"text":"Mixed...the interior is breathtaking.  The food and service were a mixed bag.  We arrived at opening on a Sunday for brunch.  After the waiter described the Dutch Pancakes and I ordered them...someone called from the kitchen no, no we don't have them this morning.  What a disappointment since I had been salivating over them based on the online menu.  Also a bad first impression since I was the first to order at the table.  OK what can I order quickly so the next person can order.  Hoe cakes ok - somewhat similar...I'll try that.  OH NO...I didn't read the fine print.  The Hoe cakes are covered with Duck and I do not eat Duck. Yuck.  So I said I'll pay for my first dish but I can't eat it.  Can you bring me the french toast that has been served to others at the table?  They replaced my order quickly.  The french toast was bread pudding covered with Bananas Foster and it was outstanding.  Here's the service question ....since the Dutch Pancakes with Bananas Foster was not available. He should have suggested I order the French Toast with Bananas Foster.  Ultimately I was filled and happy with my food.  I surveyed the table and got a mixed bag of reviews.  Several tasted my duck but no one wanted to eat it.  Take it off the menu.  Two of the ladies at my table have lived in France and were disappointed with the Croque Monsieur.  They expected the egg to be inside the sandwich not on top of it.  I did hear a few complaints about price but hey I'm used to paying more for Brunch and the atmosphere and experience were worth it. So my advice for the staff...prepare better so menu items are always available.  Eat each of the dishes and edit.  Continue to refine."}
{"text":"If you're a nosher, this is your spot! The vegetables & sides menu is where you live. Do NOT pass on the cauliflower side. I ordered it twice. In one sitting . It's just that good!  The beet, brussels, and squash side was missing the squash. Ok nbd. The shrimp add-on was a bit weak - they weren't flayed, had a quasi-canned quality, and lacked any seasoning you'd just expect with a southern inspired menu.   My dining companions were not thrilled with the gumbo (too smokey) or the catfish (not crispy or spicy). However, the grits and collard greens were off the chart good. They also raved about the cocktails - strong, very strong."}
{"text":"When I discovered there was a new restaurant that opened in Central Phoenix I was excited. When I learned it was southern food I became apprehensive. The southern food that I grew up eating was all cooked with pork fat. Well, I was thrilled that SR had vegetarian options.   I started with the mac & cheese sampler. It was larger than I expected so I shared with my husband. The dish was good, but needed a splash of red pepper flake on top. I went with the broccoli, cauliflower, leek casserole entree that was topped with candied pecans. Overall, it was pretty good.  The best part of the meal was the coconut cake with coconut pudding. It's not a thick pudding more like a pudding glaze that accompanies the cake. The cake was moist, light and not at all sugary.  There are a few things that I would like to mention. Rochelle, our waitress was friendly and welcoming. When I finished the mac & cheese sampler I sat the empty bowl at the corner of the table. Several waiters walked by without picking it up. When I was done with the dessert plate I did the same thing and again it was ignored. I've been to several restaurants in the area (Central Ave) and it feels like a team effort. Everyone fills empty water glasses and everyone removes dirty dishes.There was a table of 4 sitting to the left of us that received special attention. We are all here spending money so aren't we all special!  Southern Rail gets 4 stars for the food and 3 stars for customer service."}
{"text":"So I have tried this place twice and there will not be a third time. The staff and service was fine so that's the good thing. The bad is they have a very limited menu...almost every dish has pork and/or bacon so don't think about trying to be healthy or if you dont eat pork...and to top that off the food was just mediocre. It was very bland. I have had the cauliflower casserole, the fried chicken and I can't even remember what else. I was disappointed I just thought the food would be a bit more amazing with this big nice new space. The ambiance is good. Oh yes, I can't leave out the drinks were good and they had a good wine list but let's be honest you can get a good drink in abundance in AZ so I was looking for good food and this place just didn't do it for me. I wouldn't likely go back...sorry"}
{"text":"5 Star food and service!  1 Star decor.  Sunday brunch food was excellent - I highly, highly recommend the sticky bun  to start if you dare, with all its glorious maple goo on top.  Corned beef hash was a hit too, and service was attentive and very friendly.  The decor just looked like they took what was left from the PV Mall Coco's that recently closed and is being bulldozed...dated.  I would go back for sure, just not with someone I wanted to impress."}
{"text":"These are the most unaccommodating people I have ever interacted with. How ever the meals come is how you're going to get it, they won't switch anything out such as sides or pieces of Chicken. They will charge you for any and everything, I have no issues with paying but damn!! At least let the charges make sense, also the service is slow and the manager Casey is rude.  Chicken batter was sweet and caked on and once the skin was removed it was wet and gummy. The greens were good but had no meat as advertised in the menu. Mashed Potatoes could have used a straw to suck them up with and not a spoon or fork.   Not worth the money or time!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner early evening on a Sunday.  The place wasn't very busy when we arrived, but by 6:00 it was bustling.  We have traveled extensively in the South (and I was born in Oklahoma), so we are accustomed to excellent southern food (even if most southern fare is over salted).  Southern Rail did not disappoint.  We had fully intended to order main dishes, but after looking at the happy hour menu, decided on our version of southern tapas - lots of starters and sides.  The deviled eggs were amazing (but my wife would have preferred less mustard).  Not only were the deviled eggs perfect for me, but the piece of fried chicken skin stuck in each egg half really provided the taste and texture that set these off from the fare you would receive at most restaurants.  My red beans and rice were absolutely delicious, as was the gumbo.  My only criticism was that those dishes were almost all red beans and gumbo and too light on the rice.  I ordered a \"cup\" of each and received a good sized bowl - took much of both home with me.  The collard greens were simply to die for.  They were tender (not a description most people would expect for collard greens) and the spicing was on the hot side - just perfect as I did not have to add pepper sauce to them.  Red beans and rice, as well as the gumbo, had plenty of heat, which I like very much.  Speaking of spice, the fried green tomatoes were perfectly cooked - crispy on the outside, firm, yet tender inside.  The breading was nicely spicy as well.  The tomatoes were accompanied by a pretty good sized portion of their pimiento cheese - also delicious.  I truly don't understand some reviews that complain about spice lacking - all our dishes were spiced wonderfully - AND they weren't over salted.  Southern Rail, to me, is an excellent restaurant with service that is spot on, food that is amazing, and an atmosphere that is noisy enough you don't have to worry about someone listening to your conversation, but not so noisy that you can't HAVE a conversation.  I would definitely recommend Southern Rail to anyone looking for excellent southern fare in the Southwest."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Sunday, since we're having such great cool weather we sat outside.  I ordered two sides, gumbo and collard greens - both were great.  Gumbo was very flavorful and had a ton of sausage and chicken.  The greens were cooked perfectly, just the right amount of heat and no bitterness.  Though they were both 'sides' they were big portions I could only finish half of each.  My hubs had the catfish PO boy with red beans and rice.  Lots of sausage in the red beans.  Our server was very attentive.  We will definitely be back to try them for dinner.  If you're craving gumbo this is a great place to get your fix."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place so much, we came for the $25 bourbon and barbecue deal which comes with 2 glasses of bourbon and a plate of food. My fiancé and I ordered a glass of bourbon each which took 20 minutes to come, but whatever. Our friends we were sitting with ordered another round of drinks and our server mistakenly brought us another round of drinks for the table, which we sent back as we didn't order them. Our server came back to the table with the drinks and said we should just take the drinks as they are included in our barbecue platter and won't be extra. We accepted this even though we didn't order or want the drinks. The check comes and we have an $81 bill, rather than $25. We questioned this and our server said that he charged us for all our drinks and said he would fix it. Instead of fixing the issue he took off two drinks and left two drinks on our tab, saying our deal only came with two drinks instead of four and he needed to charge us for the two drinks we did not order and actually returned originally. We asked to speak to a manager who was honestly the most incompetent person I have ever encountered in the restaurant industry. He literally told us it wasn't his problem that his server didn't understand the dinner deal and went so far as to insult us, stating \"well this is how simple math works in our restaurant\" and \"so you guys are just trying to get free drinks\" after our friend who had the same bill mistake very nicely explained the confusion. I can't even believe this moron has a job at all, let alone a job in customer service. Our server Aaron was the only redeeming part of this experience, I am still in disbelief this manager decided to insult our party of six instead of just apologizing and fixing the issue. It took over an hour for us to actually pay our bill. Run far away"}
{"text":"Had lunch at southern rail. Loved the place. As any foodie in Phoenix knows Justin Beckett has blazed new trails here in Phoenix for some time.  The location on west camelback has an urban feeling that is not found in Phoenix. The Space is in an old building that has been refurbished wonderfuly . But the food is the Main Attraction, We had the Gumbo for a starter and it was one of the best I have ever had. For our main dish I had the Chicken and Biscuts , WOW! Amazing"}
{"text":"Surprisingly cute venue.  The interior is amazing!  We came between brunch and dinner so we were limited to the small plate menu.  Have to come back for the regular menu.  Interesting drinks, sampler and good fried green tomatoes."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience! The food was delicious! The fried green tomatoes, the dirty rice balls, the corn bread muffins, the fried chicken! It was all soooo good! It's hard to be a southern boy in Arizona sometimes, but I'm feeling a little more at home now! When I thought I couldn't manage another bite, our server served up a birthday slice of bread pudding that might have topped it all. Josh was exceptional! His recommendations were spot on and the constant attention from him and other members of the staff meant we never went without. This was my third time visiting Southern Rail and, while the first two times were great, this time was above and beyond! Great work ya'll!"}
{"text":"FIRST time here.  Since Southern Rail is in my neighborhood we walked down the street and were looking forward to seeing what this place is all about.  It's beautiful inside and out.  It was 5:00 pm, the parking lot was packed, but only 1 person sitting at the bar.  Not a good sign.  When you go into a restaurant here in Phoenix, especially during Happy Hour, you expect it to be crowded.  Deviled eggs, meh (I can make better at home).  Fried green tomatoes were cold and hard on the inside and served with a large warm wilted piece of basil.  They must have been left over from lunch.  The chopped salad was just OK.  I was disappointed to say the least.  LAST time here."}
{"text":"FOOD Fantastic!  The food tastes fresh and flavorful. Get your \"Southern\" on.  The fried chicken is amazing, the decor is fun.  The staff is attentive.  Changing Hands bookstore across the aisle. This is a must stop!"}
{"text":"We had small plates, the gumbo and blue cheese tart. Both were very good!  The German chocolate cake was absolutely amazing!  Great atmosphere and fun bar!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. It was not busy at all.   Came here because it got some decent reviews and wanted to enjoy brunch with the boyfriend for my birthday as we are from out of town.   Food was ok. Nothing outstanding. If I were in town again I wouldn't come back. Everyone kept raving about the fried green tomatoes and it was alright."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken poboy with gumbo on side and date tried the watermelon salad. Sat in the side patio and enjoyed the view and decor but finished the meal with little to rave about. Needless to say, we were both underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food!!  I also had the gumbo but I did not feel that it was real true gumbo more of a jambalaya then anything but it was still delicious!!  Our waiter Chris was amazing and tended to all of our needs.  We even got to speak with the manager and gave her big thumbs up which is a big deal coming from foodies!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"i brought my mom with me because the building is the old Beefeaters on camelback and mom worked there in college :) this is the reason we gave this place the old college try ;)   First our bartender was great - nice and friendly. Drinks were good :) they have a huge beer selection but its American only. Mom is not so into american beer but besides that the beer on tap could be colder. Its summer in AZ and tap beer needs to feel like its on ice.   Second the food selection has a southern theme which is awesome - I'm a southern girl so its a great fit! We had the okra - it was excellent and perfectly fried now the sauce that comes with it not so much. Its like they tried to do a relish ramoulade but it tastes more like a thousand island fail.   Third we tried the toast and jams - now the jams were great very different and fun there was an excellent tomato jam that had an orange background- it was great! Then the onion bacon jam different but great - and a pimento spread that wasn't bad and I'm not crazy about pimento so thats saying something- the problem was the toast :/ it was this toasted bread that had a soft crunch like it was stale :/ they did bring us more but it tasted the same - i think its the wrong bread selection for this dish - toasted french bread would have been amazing! They did take the dish off the bill.   Now overall i enjoyed what we ordered but i did not find it worth the price - it is very pricey for what is served. If you do go do not miss the okra or the ginger beer - those 2 items cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and everything was delicious.  We had the fried chicken, smoked chicken and biscuits, blackened catfish, and a side of macaroni.  Portions are generous. Will be visiting again, soon!"}
{"text":"The PBS program \"Check Please\" got us to this great place;  the great food, service and atmosphere will bring us back!    Great New Orleans inspired food without all the NO crap.  Don't miss Southern Rail.  If you do, you are the loser!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the drinks and food were good.  We had several apps and all got different entrees and dessert, everyone we all seemed to feel the same.  Go with the steak over the pork loin!  We were in the back room and it was super loud with large parties but otherwise a great experience.  Great redevelopment of a historic restaurant and the bookstore next store is awesome as well."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with my wife for dinner. First off, the ambience, decor, and staff are on-point; the bar area looked especially inviting. We ordered the Fried Okra, Red Beans & Rice, and the Andouille Gumbo as an appetizer; all three were very delicious. Main courses included their Fried Chicken and 1/2 Rack Ribs. The quality of meat for both the chicken and ribs was exceptional, however the fried chicken lacked the flavor I was expecting; it was almost like the batter had no additional spices. The ribs were amazing, smoked first then finished off with a sweet-tangy sauce. The drink menu is something to be mentioned as well. They have an unmatched selection of whiskey, scotch, and other liquors, as well as, inspiring cocktails. All-in-all I would highly recommend Southern Rail for a good meal accompanied with good drink."}
{"text":"They've done an excellent job with the restaurant. First time visiting and we will returning soon. Drink menu is very good with a nice variety of bourbons and scotches. Small plate selection is also very good. We ordered the tomato, onion, and bacon tart -- along with the fried green tomatoes, both were excellent! For our entrees we ordered the gumbo and pork tenderloin... absolutely amazing!   Service was handled by Chris who was very friendly, relaxed, and knew the menu. I don't usually make note of waitstaff by name for future reference but he left a lasting impression and will certainly ask for him the next time we visit.   Thank you to everybody for an excellent dinner!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here and try some of Chef Beckett's masterpieces, and I was not at all dissapointed! My mom and I ended up here during Social hour and found a lovely list of perfect sized portions for the afternoon.   First let's start with the sweet tea. Tea perfect. I mean, I would have said it was phenomenal alone, but my mother is the ultimate fresh tea connoisseur and she was in love. Subtle flavors of peach .. perhaps? Some mint? Not too sweet, and super fresh. We couldn't get enough.   We ordered the Fried Greet Tomatoes to share (pictured) because of course we've seen the movie, Fried Green Tomatoes, far too often and such a delicacy is hard to find in these parts ;) We gobbled that down and alongside our main dishes for the afternoon - the BT Grilled Cheese - perfectly textured, not too hard grilled cheese paired with the most epic bell pepper and tomato soup I've possibly ever had and my mom's salad. Both were exactly as we could have hoped. I generally find that with \"gourmet\" grilled cheeses it is baked so crisp on the outside that I cut my mouth trying to bite into the things. No so with these mini sandwiches on a gentle panini bread.   Our servers were friendly and attentive and the atmosphere, which is light, airy and open was relaxing and just what you'd like to experience when dining at such a lovely afternoon sweet tea establishment such as the Southern Rail. And then afterwards, you can head next door and wander around the Changing Hands bookstore, complete with the First Draft bar inside. All the things you need for a complete, lazy Wednesday afternoon in the desert."}
{"text":"Awesome Greens, red beans & rice! I'm not really a bread person bit the corn bread is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for the first time and sat at the bar.  Had some bourbon served neat and their biscuits and gravy with shrimp added to it.  Nice selection of bourbon and the server was informative of what they had in stock.  The food was good but I would probably get it without the shrimp next time (cost 6 bucks to add I believe 5 shrimp).  Will stop by again if I'm in the area as they have a nice outdoor area too."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  I do not believe the Southern food here is as subtle or \"elegant\" as Okra.  The food here is more down-home and hearty, with some very good dishes and a couple that were not good, but I give extra props to Chef Beckett for hosting specialty dinners and making those nights quite memorable.  I will start with the one glaring negative, and it was the gumbo.  Came for lunch and ordered the gumbo with smoked chicken and grilled andouille.  It was not good.  It lacked the depth of flavor that seafood adds to a gumbo and apart from an overwhelming smoke flavor, there was another off flavor in it that I did not enjoy.  Before this, I ordered the dirty rice balls and these were tasty.  Above average, not mind-blowing, but tasty.  My wife and I also came for two special event dinners here, and like I said, much respect to Chef for hosting.  We came to Fowl Out night for the 7 Chefs Series, and I know Chef Beckett didn't prepare mos of the dishes that night, but it came from his kitchen and the food and service were all phenomenal.  (Except, interestingly, Chef Campbell's hot chicken, which was big but not spicy or flavorful enough.)  Chef Beckett did prepare a smoked duck confit dish that night with dijon spaetzle, garlic chard, and cracklins - this dish was excellent.  The other specialty dinner was to celebrate Chef Sean Brock's new cookbook Heritage.  With recipes from the book, Chef Beckett did not disappoint, turning out dish after dish that were not just evocative of Chef Brock's style and ethos, but spot-on renditions.  My wife and I would know, since we've dined at both Husk and McCrady's.  I would say Chef Beckett's fried chicken skins that night surpassed the chicken skins we had at Husk.  As to the regular menu, the fried green tomatoes are very good, with the pea tendrils an extra plus tot his dish.  The fried okra is serviceable.  The greens were cooked enough (maybe a tad over-cooked),  and both the cider brined pork loin and catfish are quite good.    So like I said, slight preference for Okra.  But don't fail to miss a special dinner night at Southern Rail.  Those nights tend towards the amazing."}
{"text":"I went during Marti gras. It was unpleasantly loud but made the atmosphere uppity.  The staff was friendly but service was mehh. I was in a party of 7 and food arrived like 15-20 min apart from each other. So makes it awkward to either courteously wait for other peoples to arrive and have yours get cold.. Or just start eating when they didn't get their food yet. Also, the cocktails came after the food arrived.   The food was good but not worth the $45 for a meal for two (with tax and tip) and the atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Great food, good service and nice ambience."}
{"text":"Great spot for some Southern Fun!! Fried green tomatoes, gumbo and Po Boys! The reason for my post is the Muffaletta Burger! One of the best in town!  Great bar staff too!  and did I mention the Muffaletta Burger?"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, I really do! But... the food just isn't there... I've had +/- 7 or 8 different dishes now (two visits) and only two have been better than average (just slightly better). Those being, the mac and fried green tomatoes. However, I think both are over priced. 4 slices of a tomato is like $8 or something? Youch! Justin homie, we all know green tomatoes and batter don't cost dat much!   Conversely, the gumbo is so far from what I was expecting and just flat boring that it really took me back. I literally looked at my wife when it came out and asked if she thought that was the gumbo?? It looked like rice and KFC gravy (similar taste to appearance). Almost no flavor, complexity, zing, pow, pop, bang, etc! Maybe that's traditional gumbo? Don't know, but in my humble opinion, it needs a total redo. We're talking tear up the script and start over again. A page one rewrite.   Ok, 'nuff dissin' on the expensive food. The building/property/story/decor/location/atmosphere/super close to my house is uber tight. Real good stuff, so I slide it up to 3 stars (really more like a 2.85). All that said, I really do encourage you to check it out for yourself. Venue Projects did an outstanding job on the whole thing. Wishing them the best of luck and will definitely be back but beg and plead they keep working on the food and prices."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the menu. Not so healthy food options. I ordered a salad ($12) and added chicken ($8) and the portion of chicken was very small. Unfortunately the ambiance is good, food was definitely not my style."}
{"text":"The service was top-notch and the food exquisite.  The prices were outrageous for the portion sizes and the restaurant has a policy of not splitting checks which was irritable.  We stopped in on a whim as we had noticed lots of cars whenever we drove by.  Turns out, the night we were there, most of the cars either belonged to the bar/bookstore next door or to employees because the restaurant was almost empty.  I wouldn't go back.  This restaurant just seems so out of place in this area of Phoenix."}
{"text":"The best cute place in Phoenix.  Saturday and Sunday the best Brunch. The appetizers,lunch,dinner,desserts are out of this world.  The coffee is amazing. It is like being in New Orleans.  Not a place for Kids at all. Romantic."}
{"text":"I was surprised by all the reviews that had less than a stellar experience. So my husband and I decided to go during lunch,  to avoid having a huge bill to pay for in the event that we had a similar experience.  Holy hell. This was awesome! Go for lunch if you aren't sure about dinner. We arrived a little after 11am, and the place had a few customers but not many. It was quiet. And our service was quick. The place is decorated really nicely, and they even kept the original booths from Beef Eaters. Loved the old country music they played! Reminded me of my grandma and I even got a little teary-eyed while waiting for our food. What a wonderful moment I had with my husband on a random lunch date.   Our server was Sarah, she was phenom! Very quick, polite, asked if we had any questions, attentive, and even brought my husband a new dessert plate because the one she gave him looked spotty. We didn't even have to ask for drink refills. She was just great and I can't say enough about her.  We ordered an app, lunch, and dessert. For the appetizer we had the toast n jam n cheese. It was small but enough to satisfy 2 people. It tasted great and the sweet onion jam is to die for!   For lunch we ordered the chilled corn soup and gumbo. Both were great. For dessert we ordered the beignets. Only 2 come in an order but 1 is enough for one person. They are fairly big. They came out fresh and covered in powdered sugar. It was a neat presentation.   We will definitely be back, can't wait to try brunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here a few weeks back before a show. Ordered off the Restaurant Week menu. Food was \"meh\". Nothing terribly exciting. Same with the dessert and wine. Kind of expected more based on reviews and the fact that they were promoting these items for Restaurant Week.  The server was nice and all, but she disappeared toward the end of our meal. We sat waiting for the check for a long time & no one else even stopped to check on us... table was cleared & we just sat.   Doubt we'll return. Definitely not worth the money or time spent."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a 1-star review because of the extremely poor value for the money.  My spouse and I opted for the 3-course menu ($39 pp) on a busy Friday night. It was comprised of salad, spaghetti sauce with sausage and shrimp served over grits, and a chocolate cake dessert.  We washed it all down with a bottle of cab-franc ($33).  The total bill for dinner with tip came to over $135!, and I still had to hit McDonalds on the way home because I was starving after we left.  When I complained that the dessert appeared to be simply a chocolate muffin top drowned in pomegranate sauce and inedible seeds, the manager's solution was to demand that we wait at the table while she fried a donut, which was served under a virtual snowbank of powder sugar. Everything, even the supplemental donut, tasted decidedly mediocre for the price, and the portions were so small that there was barely enough food one person served between the two of us. They didn't even put a scrap of bread on the table!  This restaurant is all about location and ambiance, not food; it's a place to \"be seen\" not to eat!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for BBQ & Bourbon. It's usually and hit or miss but tonight was really good. It was turkey with sweet potatoes, Canadian bacon stuffing and apple brussel slaw."}
{"text":"I'll probably get some criticism for my review, but it was just my opinion of my visit.  Going in you could tell this is one of the those places that makes things complicated for its own sake. Rather than taking something simple and tested, they try to change it by adding a bunch of unheard of spices and charge double the price.  We came in around 8 on a Saturday night, however everything was sold out as far as the daily specials go. They don't serve the lunch menu, so that pretty much leaves salads and appetizers. After a 4 hour car ride, I wanted more than a salad, so I tried the Mac and cheese. It was strange, hints of fennel seed in a non-creamy sort of wet powdered texture that wasn't pleasant at all. It was almost like bland paste with fennel and peppercorn. $8 please!  We also had brioche rolls and the apple butter. The rolls were about $7 and around the size of a kings Hawaiian roll. They were soft, but as soon as you bit in, it instantaneously turned into this mushy glop of flavorless paste. It did come with apple butter and that was about the only thing going for it.   I don't know who their market is, but not serving even sandwiches and having the choice between a salad and a $22 entree is a big gap. I wish they had cheeseburgers at least. What's wrong with cheese burgers?  This place gives me the feeling that it's pretentious for the sake of being pretentious. People paying more to get the feeling that they're somehow different than everyone else because they had a \"culinary experience.\"   I'm not buying it. You'll find me around the corner at the Windsor where at least their food tastes good.   They do get stars for service I guess. The wait staff was friendly enough."}
{"text":"Amazing southern food  - try fried chicken and the sampler (great smoked salmon) plate, brussel sprout dip. Delicious. Even the 4 cheese grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup were perfect. Service was great - even brought apple juice to help calm my preschooler as we were ordering. Good sized portions - very tasty and filling. Trendy western ambiance."}
{"text":"I wanted to write this review based on my experience on Monday March 21st at around 8PM. I was at the bookstore next door and decided to peek in. I was immediately greeted by the nicest gentleman who answered my questions about what menu items can be \"veganised.\" I was really impressed that he was knowledgable that I decided to try dinner there.  Our waitress was wonderful, I believe her name was Bridgette, but don't quote me on that. She had communicated w/ the gentleman who initially answered my questions and was aware of my vegan concern. I initially wanted to try the cauliflower dish, but she informed me that the cauliflower was fried in the same oil they use to fry mean products. Oh my gosh, how amazing is it that she informed me of that. She also informed me that their salad dressing had honey, again, very impressed. She went back and forth and talked to the chef several times, which I felt awful about, BUT, she was so patient and came back w/ a suggestion of a quinoa bowl for me w/ all veggies.  I decided to try it, and it was delicious. I super appreciated that the staff was so accommodating and also the communication w/ the chef was excellent. I was so impressed how educated this staff was about dietary restrictions but even more educated how they went out of their way.  I seriously am so awed by their awesome customer service. When I asked another waitress where he ladies room was, she walked me there. It was so nice, everything was so exceptional and I am so grateful for the dietary restriction knowledge and accommodation."}
{"text":"First time in at Southern Rail was for brunch on an early Sunday morning. My fiancé and I first tried the beignets which were FANTASTIC! My main was the avocado toast which was both savory and sweet. My fiancé had the catfish po boy which I demanded half of and it was amazing. Highly recommend - seriously delicious!"}
{"text":"\"Southern Cajun\" food.  Not the cajun you're used to, but with a different southern twist.  We had fired green tomatoes, and I had the shrimp po boy.  The sauce was spicy, and bread was crusty french bread.  Very good service, great food, nice casual atmosphere.  Interesting unique place."}
{"text":"We're  having lunch here now. Friday afternoon. Servers and bartenders could give a sh** about their very few customers. Food was horrible, not southern tasting at all. Dry, weird sampler aka antipasto platter didn't make sense. Smoked fish wasn't  fresh before it hit their smoker. Congealed bacon jam. Granola looking nut garnish. Hubs had shrimp p.o. boy. Very po. Again, shrimp wasn't fresh, presentation was so sad. Subway looks better.  We are seriously disappointed :-("}
{"text":"Modernized southern classics that make you drool. Great atmosphere and incredible service. I ordered 3 apps an entrée and two desserts along with a few sides with a friend and had zero complaints, only compliments...to the chef."}
{"text":"All these stars are for the service and taste of some of the dishes. Went here last Friday night after some friends texted saying they were there and I should come join them! I was excited since it's a 5 min walk from home and have been wanting to check it out. My friends had the Mac and cheese, cheesy grits, and grilled pork chop. The Mac and cheese was the big hit. my friend said the grilled pork chop wasn't worth the price, nothing wrong with it, just nothing special about it either. I got a Moscow mule and the tomato tart, both of which were delicious, but the portions were tiny for the prices. If I were to go again, I would probably only go during happy hour."}
{"text":"I went in for brunch and had the Bread Pudding French Toast. It was SO good!  The staff was friendly and I loved the decor.  I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but honestly way over priced for the amount of food you get. I paid $18 for a meal that felt more like an appetizer! (I got the smoked chicken and dumplings) And they didn't even bring out my right meal at first (wish I kept it though looked like more food than what I got) like I said the place LOOKS great but honestly won't come here again."}
{"text":"The space is beautiful. The concept is great. The staff are attentive. The food is okay; that's the problem okay food disappoints. Worse, the menu is lacking in depth and creativity. Given the idea, this place should be much better."}
{"text":"A warm and inviting atmosphere.  The outdoor patio, bar and interior seating were all appealing.  We chose a comfortable booth inside.  It was very clean and I appreciated the service - thanks \"Buddy\".  If your a fan of loin than your taste buds will be happy with their cider brined pork loin!  The house smoked pork ribs and grandma's meatloaf were not something I would personally be back for.   We enjoyed and it was nice to stroll the adjoining bookstore afterwards."}
{"text":"This place was our first time trying here in Phoenix. The southern food menu was very extensive. We enjoyed the food immensely . I had  the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and collard greens which was excellent. My wife had the jambalaya and collard greens which was just as good. We will most definitely coming back to this restaurant again when we're staying in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I admit, this review of Southern Rail is about a year after I ate there; I'm not sure what it was that I ate exactly. That being said, it was also unmemorable.  What I do remember about the food that I had, along with 5 other people, we all felt the food lacked proper seasoning. Not sure if it was just a lack of seasoning, mostly salt layers were missing, or a just bland food in general. I've eaten a lot of southern cooking and the just didn't cut it.   It looked beautiful, and was presented well, and the building and decor is beautiful.   If I try the place again, I'll be sure to update this review."}
{"text":"The design and style of the restaurant is great. I have dined here twice. Once for a girly brunch then again fro a date night for Restaurant Week. I didn't enjoy the po'boys, unfortunately, there was not a ton a of flavor to the sauces. What I did like from the brunch were the beignets. Service was better the first time vs our date night.  For Restaurant Week, the server was nice but a little awkward. Hubby had the pork loin, I ordered the veggie enchiladas. The cool thing was, it came with a glass of wine on top of the 3 course meal. Dessert was good, bread pudding and a chocolate salted caramel cake. It was good food and we didn't have issues with it but at the same time we were not overly impressed with the presentation or taste of the food. We might stop by for a drink if were in the area but since we live in the East Valley, I don't see that realistically happening."}
{"text":"Hate to leave a bad review, but the food here is not great and not only not great but pretty repulsive. The side of \"mac n cheese\" tastes like HORSE RADISH mac n cheese, and has this disgusting strong tang like wasabi even. Then, the simple \"corn bread muffins\" sound nice right? Wrong. They are not delicious they are smothered with green and red spicy peppers throughout- Not a single bite without multiple chunks of pepper. The burgers and simple meats are ok. Not to mention, they were \"out\" of two different dishes - the only vegetarian options- by the time I went in at 6pm. Not acceptable. Please save your money and don't eat here."}
{"text":"Southern Rail is located right off Camelback and 3rd Ave - traffic can be a bit of a struglle during rush hour. Restaurant is always clean with a bit of a rustic southern feel to it.   This day I went in for Happy Hour prior to a book signing next door at Changing hands book store.  The devil eggs are yummy, and cornbread.  Got a refreshing glass of Wine.   Bartender was super friendly."}
{"text":"Loved the concept and the single malt and bourbon selection, But when the bill came there was an extra 2$ ice charge for each of my drinks!!  Seriously! The bartender's excuse was that they pour 1oz more when ordered with ice!!  It would be nice if this was actually mentioned in the menu!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place for a Sunday afternoon drink. We were pleasantly surprised by the ambiance, food/drink selection and service. We ended up staying much longer than planned. The  cocktails were appropriately priced and during \"social hour\" they were discounted $3.00 which made them even better. We ordered a few appetizers like fried green tomatoes and cornbread muffins. The cheese sauce served with the tomatoes was delicious. An added bonus was Jordan who served us. He provided a lot of detail in explaining the menu as well as an overall professional approach his job. We plan to come back here soon for the live music on Sunday's at 5:00."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had a great experience. Enjoyed the special of a combo pork belly and pastrami. There was enough to share. The bartender, Garret, suggested some novel Gins for our Gin and Tonic. They have some very unique options in their Rums, Whiskeys and Gins. The beignet dessert was fun to share. The bar will offer an even better experience as things cool this fall as there is a very nice patio adjacent to and served by the bar."}
{"text":"Finally a family restaurant thats put into use in this poor building... which its use to be a beef eaters.  I came here with my mother and sister!  :)   Such a good atmosphere here.  As an appetizer, we have the macaroni and cheese. It was delicious. The texture and the cheese was on point. Mom, she got the catfish. Was not fond of it at all. It was so oily and very salty... :/  Sister, she got pork ribs, it was delicious and the side corn salad was like salsa mix, she enjoyed it.  Me, I had the broccoli, cauliflower casserole.....It was too salty, too cheesy, not enough broccoli and too much onions in it :(    Our waiter was so attentive in the beginning. Then midway, she forgot a few things and didn't come to the table til I ask for the bill..  Me likes scaring him I'm doing things right Maybe, I'll try something else?"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly and efficient service, no drama about getting a reservation, super-cool rehab of the old Beefeater's.  What's not to like.  Our new go-to for family dinners."}
{"text":"I have resided for long stretches and at several locations throughout the South and am an unabashed fan of country cooking. Southern Rail has tasty and authentic fare(you can always tell by the gumbo), and the atmosphere and location are appealing. That guy Beckett really knows how to package his good food. Why then were both my wife and I underwhelmed? Why do Lolo's or Mrs White's hold more appeal for us? It's the association of Southern cooking with home style. Our service was friendly, but somehow slick. It's not about price. It's about feeling welcome. Antoine's in NO is expensive and fancy, but you always feel like family coming home. Maybe Mr Beckett can inject a little \"Y'awl come back now, Hear\" into his plan"}
{"text":"Big fan of Beckett's Table so was expecting the same high level of service, atmosphere, food quality, wine list, etc.  We dined there on a Saturday night - two couples and a fifth wheel. Our reservation still showed for 4 at the restaurant, which was unfortunate. I'm chocking this up to OpenTable - and it could be why I'm seeing fewer of my favorite haunts use OT for their reservation system. Not holding that against Southern Rail.  The place was P.A.C.K.E.D.!!! Everywhere you looked - bodies. It was a very noisy place, not very good for group or intimate conversations. We often found ourselves yelling at our dinner companions.   The decor was beautiful... along with the rustic charm were splashes of opulence and beauty - including the ginormous arrangement of flowers right behind us. It was breathtakingingly beautiful and fresh. Much as I loved looking at the arrangement, sadly, it's scent interfered with the taste and smell of my dinner. It was gorgeous - I'd hate to see the restaurant stop providing their guests with such an amazing thing of beauty - but in the end, its smell did interfere with my food experience.  Our waiter was great - quick, attentive, did a great job explaining the specials and offering suggestions.   Where my issue is, is with the food. I just feel that it didn't measure up to its sister restaurant. It lacked the WOW factor that Beckett's Table had. I left there satiated, but not astonished - as I did with Beckett's.   I had the chicken with biscuit dumplings. It was simply \"ok\". My husband and one of our companions both had the ribs, which were pretty good - the sauce was very obviously scratch made and had some robust, complex flavors to it - not like most bbq sauces. This stuff was high brow, for sure. The other couple tried the prix fixe menu (it was restaurant week afterall) and loved what they had - the FGTs were amazing, according to them. We all enjoyed the deserts. We all liked the food - don't get me wrong... it was simply missing that WOW that Beckett's Table has."}
{"text":"Went with a friend who was working in the area.   The food was Southwest Fusion with interesting side dishes.   The deserts were fabulous ."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant- consistently great food and love coming here for brunch. Get the fried green tomato Benedict. I'm a sucker for a good latte and they always serve them in the cutest cups."}
{"text":"Some of the items I ordered were bland to my palate. I absolutely love the atmosphere and the management. Our server seemed a bit disconnected to her job that day, other than that I would definitely give it a B+"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I would give it a 3.5 but Yelp doesn't have that as an option.  I think it could be a 4 in the very near future.  The space itself is amazing.  Gorgeous. Right next door to Changing Hands bookstore which is so...cool.  I'd never been in one before.  I'm from Georgia so I love southern food and get excited when I find a good one especially in AZ!  The food was really, good. I had the fried chicken. It was super crispy and super juicy.  The only complaint I would have would be that I went home with 3 pieces of friend chicken but I had no sides left.  The side size of serving is too small in proportion to the amount of the main part of your entree.  That's the only negative I have.  The service was great. Will definitely go back again soon."}
{"text":"I had the grilled watermelon salad not bad but disappointed with the name only 3 or 4 small pieces of watermelon to be found. Had good flavors though. I had the head on BBQ shrimp. Wasn't exactly expecting to have to remove all the shell to eat, also a bit surprised with the flavors. Tasted fine but expected a lighter sauce without body shells in-tacked and more BBQ flavor. We had the beignets for dessert they were excellent."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fried chicken, you're better off at Culinary Dropout down the street. The helping was plentiful but the breading was boring and while the chicken was cooked perfectly, it had zero flavor. The whole time I was wishing I was at Culinary. The mashed potatoes were unmemorable and the corn on the cob was insultingly small- about 1 inch long. Insane for $20. With so many great (and more inexpensive) restaurants in the area, I'm not sure what they're thinking.   3 stars instead of 2 because the Rail Runner drink was excellent and the beignets were amazing. The atmosphere, design and staff were on point."}
{"text":"It was decent food, however it was a bit pricey for just decent food. Ambiance is really nice and I love the first draft next to it!"}
{"text":"We had a truly delightful dinner at Southern Rail. The food was fresh beautiful and delicious. After four amazing courses we were happily satiated. Southern Rail is a delight for the eyes and taste buds. Literally no detail has been overlooked. We look forward to returning in the cooler months and sitting outside! They also have a great wine list that is one third Arizona wine  which we love! This is on our must hit list every time we are visiting Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Review is just on the beignets! Just a FYI!  So i returned home from New Orleans on a beignets kick thanks to the greatest, Cafe Du Monde.   Been searching around Phx for some good ones and stumbled upon here the other night. First round of them - they tasted exactly like a fryer, like fryer grease. And don't worry smart-alecs, I know they are fried but the ones in New Orleans and every where else I've gotten them, did not have a nasty after taste. Presentation was beautiful though!  Last night, I was convinced that we must have just had a bad batch and let's try them again. With being .5 miles away, i wanted to like this place. Again, same problem - they basically taste like a fried piece of chicken with the first couple seconds when you bite into them. Plus, they shouldnt crunch or make a crunch sound."}
{"text":"I went to Southern Rail last Friday with a friend and her mom with a miraculous reservation (called at around 4 and got a res for 5:45 despite no availability online... yesss!). We tried many of the salads and small plates and they were all good (I guess they worked their kinks out) Here is what we had:   onion and tomato tart - very good, the onions were nicely caramelized, so their flavor was not overly strong... yum!  Cornbread salad- every element on this dish was delicious, the okra was perfect, the sauce was good, the beets were even good (and I do no like beets)  The brioche rolls - these things could be addicting, they are served with some wonderful apple butter and when eaten together, they are a good balance of sweet and salty.   Dirty rice croquettes- these were my overall favorite... they were bursting with flavor and extremely filling. They were spicy with a nice fresh element from the greens served with it and the pea shoots. Overall, a real winner.   Watermelon salad - very light and fresh, yummy  Gumbo- nice flavor, a little less spicy than I would typically like, but overall a solid dish. The small plate is a small cup, but it's hearty.   The broccoli and cauliflower casserole - this was ok, but parts of it were ice cold.... not great.   These small plates were more than enough for the 3 of us, we were stuffed and didn't even finish all of the food.   We also had a couple of cocktails. The Austin mule was delicious... perfectly gingery and citrusy. My friend had another cocktail that sounded good... the name escapes me, but it was way too boozy tasting. Overall, this place was very good, and I am already planning a return visit!"}
{"text":"I ate here with five other friends for Arizona Restaurant Week. We had some drinks at the bar - happy hour prices - and the drinks were very good.   Once we sat down, four of the five of us ordered off the restaurant week menu. My gumbo was good as was my salad - and a big portion of salad too. I had the shrimp and grits - was quite good and I couldn't stop until I had finished all the grits.   Our biggest problem was service. The restaurant wasn't even completely full but it took forever to get each course - even the salads - and we had to ask for more water - wait staff wasn't very attentive and it really shouldn't take almost three hours to eat a meal here."}
{"text":"First time there got the fried chicken, yummy..... Ordered the fried green tomatos they we're great only bad thing was I only go 4 small pieces. Over all I would go back again."}
{"text":"great place. nice atmosphere, friendly service, and the food was delicious. overall concept of the property is pretty cool too."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing!! The original restaurant we had reservations at for Valentine's Day cancelled on us...Turned out to be a good thing because we ended up here!! What an amazing restaurant, from the ambiance to the service. They were very very busy being a holiday and the server did not skip a beat. Even when I found that they had run out of my favorite kind of dessert, he not only took care of our dessert, but brought me chocolate ice cream for my \"chocolate craving.\" So thoughtful! We absolutely loved this place and cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great to go for lunch. The restaurant is super comfortable and nice inside and the service is terrific. This new little plaza is really nice with Changing Hands Book Store and Southwest Gardener right next door. Alas, I didn't have enough time to shop on my lunch hour. I had the shrimp po'boy with a side of collard greens. The po'boy wasn't like what I've eaten in New Orleans but then, I don't think anything will be.  All in all it was a really great sandwich and I would definitely order it again. There are several things on the menu that look fantastic but I'm really interested in trying the fried green tomatoes. The day I went the doors were wide open and it was as if we were sitting outside, enjoying Phoenix's beautiful Spring weather."}
{"text":"Holy cow!  I live for a good biscuits and gravy.  The chorizo biscuits and gravy made my heart and stomach so happy.  Great service and unbelievable food.   Thanks for a great meal"}
{"text":"Brunchilichious! Crispy fried green tomato benedict with a side of andouille was fantastic and the shrimp and grits were creamy and had a nice Creole kick. Throw in a little sweet tea!"}
{"text":"I found the food to be decent. The help staff was pretty good, but the manager guy casy? (Sorry bad at names) was very attentive and took great care of us because he knew there was a birthday in the group, it really made the night. Would go back for another birthday. The prices on pappy could be more realistic, like really it's not that hard to find and I'm not gonna pay for a drink what I could buy a bottle for. Haha."}
{"text":"Had a beef poor boy,  beans and rice.  The chef has a working relationship with PEPPER.  Everything was half PEPPER.  The poor boy   Was mostly limp lettuce and PEPPER, with a SMALL portion of sliced beef.  Everything was doused in some PEPPER gravy. Sandwich was only about 4 inches long.   The beans were come beans with a little white rice dumped on the top.   My friend had french fries that were from frozen  fries and way over cooked.  Not really edible.  His hamburger looked very small.     For a restaurant that is supposed to have a good reputation it was less than average food.  the service was good and waiter attentive.  They need to get off the from frozen kick and cook more fresh food to appeal to me."}
{"text":"The food was great big shout out to our server Sarah!!! The food was really good the catfish the Okra and the Gumbo was all excellent. I will be back!!! Give Sarah a raise!!!!"}
{"text":"I have rediscovered Southern Rail with their Mon /Tues BBQ special and the INSANE Muffalata (sp) Burger.   The patio is awesome. The staff is friendly and interested in their business     Oh.. And Deviled Eggs are yum."}
{"text":"We went for brunch and loved the atmosphere, building design and decor. Our waiter was attentive but not pressuring, and friendly. We especially enjoyed the sticky bun, cafe au lait (to die for), and the croque (add a soft boiled egg and you will not be disappointed).  The mimosas seemed small (but were only $4), and my Bloody Mary was sweet rather than spicy (not a fan).   A cool place to check out, but probably not one of our go to brunch spots since the menu is slightly limited (seems like half the brunch menu is po' boys)."}
{"text":"We dined at Southern Rail to celebrate my daughter's birthday - and WOW are we glad we did!    The restaurant is light - bright - and full of upscale, modernized Southern touches.  The beamed ceiling lent height and the full windows brought in a lot of natural light. As we passed by the patio, we noted it was set off the busy street, and it was incredibly charming that included a beautiful fireplace and the right blend of seating.  The service was excellent! Personal but not overbearing. Prompt and thoughtful. My restless 3yo grandson was with us, and our server immediately brought him some water in a colorful, age appropriate cup (think covered top, plastic, and a straw).  Slightly disappointed that the restaurant manager did not personalize the visit by a casual hello but our server more than made up for it.  The food was amazing!  The modernized Southern fare was fresh, delicious and visually appealing.  Cider-brined Pork Loin was cooked perfectly - medium - tender, and flavorful.  My spicy shrimp was fresh, perfectly cooked, and appropriately messy. The delightfully spicy sauce didn't overpower the head-on shrimp, while the accompanying french bread was a perfect pairing.  My daughter's Gumbo was perfection! Andouille sausage, fresh shrimp, and the broth over rice couldn't be more authentic and flavorful. Along with family style sides of fried green tomatoes and the exceptionally delicious collard greens were a great thing to share!  Overall, this was a GREAT first time experience and I KNOW it won't be my last!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at southern rail on a Sunday night with a group of coworkers. We love the restaurant's sister restaurant Beckett's table and were excited to try it! Overall, the restaurant looked wonderful and had great outdoor seating options which we enjoyed. We ordered a bottle of local arizona wine and split a couple of appetizers. The brocoli/vegetable casserole was by far the best. I ordered the pork chop which was good wonderfully but the blackened salmon and gumbo was also good. I was a little sad not to see shrimp and grits on the menu for a southern restaurant and overall I think they could take the southern influences up a notch as the flavors were very mild. Beignets were served for dessert but no honey for dipping was provided which was strange. Overall, I'd say a great atmosphere, solid food, but didn't knock my socks off."}
{"text":"Raised in Georgia, this place lit me up when we ate here. Being so far from home, I miss Southern food something fierce. Everything we ordered during happy hour (6 dishes!) was incredible. And the cocktails were to die for! Thanks for bringing a slice of a Georgia to Arizona."}
{"text":"Dear me. I try and be stingy with 5 stars, but Southern Rail earned all five last night. I was there for the grand opening and they were not serving their full menu yet, so I was excited to return when a friend decided to have her birthday dinner there. We arrived a little early for our reservation, but no problem we were seated within a couple of minutes. Our waiter was right there to bring us water and get us started on drinks.   The fried green tomatoes and the pull apart rolls with apple butter were devine. I was stuck between ordering the duck or the pork, then our waiter described them both and I ended up with the duck on dirty rice risotto and collard greens. Amazing, the duck basically melted in my mouth. Everything was so full of flavor, and just the right amount so you are not too full, but satisfied. Also had the beignets for dessert, those were also perfect. Chef Beckett happened to be in the kitchen last night, so he came out and said Happy Birthday to the guest of honor, which was so nice. She has always loved his restaurants and his cooking, so she fan girled just a little bit.   It was a perfect dinner. The wait-staff was attentive, the food was excellent, and although it is a very noisy place, I want to go back soon! (It's pricey, so unfortunately it can't be a weekly (or daily) event as much as I would like it to be.)"}
{"text":"I love Beckett's Table so there was no doubt in my mind that I would also love Southern Rail, however the Fried Chicken was beyond belief good!! I have been waiting months to actually be able to go on a Wednesday to have it and I was not disappointed!  Service was fantastic! I definitely recommend the Pie in the Jar ours were Key Lime and it was perfectly tart and sweet and soooo cute in the little jar!"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful, atmosphere and music were awesome! Moderate pricing, clean and rustic style. Love this place and we will be back."}
{"text":"This is really a 2.5 star review, but I'm bumping up because of good service.  I had been wanting to try Southern Rail, so I went for Arizona Restaurant Week.  The restaurant is really loud, even in the back room, so it makes having a conversation hard because you can hear everyone else's conversations around you.  I ordered the gumbo, pork loin and red velvet cake from the ARW menu, while my BF ordered the fried green tomatoes, red snapper and banana pudding.  While my food was okay -- not bad, but not the best food I've had, my BF did not enjoy his food at all.  And he's not typically one to complain about food, so it must've been bad.  The first thing I noticed about the fried green tomatoes is how thin they were and how hard they were fried.  If you've had fried green tomatoes in the South, you know they are supposed to be thicker slices of tomato lightly fried.  They also didn't have any seasoning.  He also did not enjoy his snapper.  My gumbo was pretty good, as was the pork loin -- although it could've been seasoned better.  The sweet potatoes and collards served with the pork loin were both good!  We ended up taking our dessert to go and it's still sitting in the fridge, so I can't speak to the dessert.  Having had such a good experience at Beckett's Table, I'm definitely disappointed with my experience at Southern Rail and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Some friends and I decided to finally check out this new restaurant in our neighborhood. Getting a table for 3 on a Thursday evening was not hassle at at.  The overall dining space is beautiful! Gorgeous wood ceiling and beams, beautiful lighting, and an amazing sliding glass wall, which I'm sure will be wonderful when it's not 115 degrees outside! One of the guests in our party noted that while the chairs for the tables are very cute - the comfort level is lacking. With the concrete floors, ceiling, and lack of sounds absorbing surfaces in the space the restaurant was rather loud (especially for only having about 7 tables at this time of night). I can imagine that it would get rather deafening during the peak hours.   The drinks were amazingly priced - not sure if it was a reverse happy hour or just a special Thursday night special but the Kettle One and Belvedere martinis were only $7!!   Service was excellent - Mike had a gift for explaining recipes on the menu that helped you taste the food without anything in front of you. Service staff really catered to the southern hospitality making sure our dinning experience was nothing short of wonderful.   We started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes which had a delicious spread accompanying. I felt they were fried perfectly - not to heavy on the batter.  I thought the duck was delicious - cooked perfectly served on top of a  delicious risotto  The Chicken and dumplings was given an \"ok\" as the dumplings were very tough, the chicken was flavored nicely, but the sauce/broth was the best part. The Pork Loin was a generous cut but was very dry and lacking flavor. However, the sweet potato that came with the pork was life changing!"}
{"text":"Another great concept only wish it was closer. Wonderful design, bar & adaptive re-use of a large, outdated restaurant into a great neighborhood gathering spot. Well done! Ps plenty of pkg!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly poor food quality & disappointing options at this place.  The name \"Southern Rail\" suggests the food has Southern flair which I would take to mean, plentiful seafood options. As a pescatarian, I was disappointed by the lack of seafood on the menu. Pork was flowing like water though.    So whatevs, I ordered the BBQ shrimp. Can't go wrong with that right? Ha! That's what I thought. Shame on me for assuming it'd be shrimp with BBQ sauce. Instead I got a bowl full of shrimp (head & eyes still intact) swimming in a sea of weird orange gravy that looked & tasted NOTHING like BBQ sauce. It was disgusting.  On the side I ordered mashed sweet potatoes and sadly, they too were abysmal. The \"sweet\" had been drowned in salty butter & odd spices that killed the essence of what a sweet potato should taste like.  I had four bites of \"dinner\", chalked it up as a loss & set my sights on dessert- red velvet cake.   Yikes. It was ALSO wretched. While the texture of the cake was moist & bouncy, the sickeningly excessive sweetness off the cream cheese frosting ruined the entire dish. I, a frosting junkie, did something I've never ever done before: scraped the frosting off & ate only the cake. Shameful but Southern Rail drove me to it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Chicken batter had no flavor. Breast cut in half counts as 2 pieces in the 4 piece meal. So cheap. For $22 I expected amazing flavor. Pieces were tiny. Deviled egg says 2. But it's 2 halves. And they look lonely on the plate sans garnish. Collard greens had no flavor. Should at least be able to taste the bacon cooked with it. Needed salt. Mixed vegetable side was okay.   Server was very attentive and accommodating. The 2 stars are only because of service. Less 3 stars due to excessive pricing for bland food in overly small portions."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on Friday because they have a very nice patio. The misters were with too much water flowing so we asked to be seated in the dining room. This is Arizona Restaurant Week so we both ordered different things off of the special menu. I had the Jambalaya. This dish was terrible. It reminded me of a cheap frozen food meal that had not been  microwaved until it was cooked all the way. I did not eat it. My wife had the pot pie. This dish has a pastry \"cookie\" on top is a small dish of vegetables. We joked about how bad both entrées tasted and looked. The desert brownie was very good.   Our server was very good and tried to do everything he could to make up for the terrible entrees. Southern Rail did not pick the best frozen food items out of the grocery story to serve for Arizona Restaurant Week."}
{"text":"beautiful restaurant! love the decor and the inside/outside bar. during the spring and fall, there is no better place in AZ to enjoy a cocktail and snack than outside at the bar or on the patio.  my boyfriend and i like to frequent their social hour quite often where we have tried nearly all of the $7 cocktails and all of them are wonderful. my favorite is \"medlock by moonlight\" and the fella is preferential to \"the gentleman johnson\".   in terms of food, we always go with the potted shrimp remoulade and the dirty rice croquettes--both are delicious. we've also tried the toast n jam n cheese, but i don't love the croutons they use (too crunchy) and i'm not a fan of pimento (the bacon jam is bomb though). we have also thoroughly enjoy the okra and my boyfriend loves the fried green tomatoes.  mostly we go for social hour, but one visit we split a daily special (aka not on the regular menu) that came with salmon and veggies and it was SO GOOD. i wish i could describe it in detail, but it was awhile ago and i may or may not have had a few medlock cocktails beforehand so my memory is fuzzy ;)  all in all, a great place to relax, enjoy some quality food & drinks and hang out!"}
{"text":"Excellent southern tastes in Central Phoenix. I was blown away by the BBQ shrimp and the ribs...a definite must have meal when I go back. The drinks were tasty and the service was spectacular. Friendly staff with great knowledge of the menu. Not being from the south, I didn't know what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised by the different taste explosions in my mouth. And the new restaurant layout and ambience is pleasant right in the heart of the city. Oh, and don't forget to get the beignets covered in powered amazingness before you leave. It's a good idea to get a reservation as it was busy and we had to wait a bit. Worth it though as Chef Beckett delivers...again."}
{"text":"Have so been wanting to try Southern Rail and finally got a chance. It's in a great location near the brand-new Changing Hands in Phoenix. Outdoor seating with heaters and the fireplace on a fairly brisk evening - gorgeous! Terrific service throughout the evening. They were out of DiSaranno for one of their specialty cocktails and the bartender made us a surprise - out of this world! Food is really good here... jambalaya, fried green tomatoes, bbq ribs, cornbread salad, succotash, and sweet potatoes. All of it wonderful. I am surprised that they don't have fried chicken on the menu every day - really surprised. You'll have to visit on a Wednesday for that item. Desserts were only passable - the beignets were rather donut like, not light and airy like they are in New Orleans. The bread pudding (highly praised) was cold in the middle and dense. Otherwise... a perfect meal."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  we sat outside by the fire listening to a.  Talented Jazz band play live,  delicious mixed drinks,  the salmon was cooked perfectly and so full of flavor. Our new favor place."}
{"text":"First things first I must say I love the Decour. My wife and I went here and ordered the meatloaf and fried chicken. Both dishes were Superb. But I have to say the collard greens that came with the chicken made this North Carolina boy miss his Dearly departed Grandmother. Yes.....they were That good.  P. S. , The grits we had as an appetizer were off the chain (excellent)!!"}
{"text":"Southern Rail, what a restaurant should be!  You can't only judge an establishment by the excellent food, you have to take in the entire experience...they crushed it!  Wait staff was awesome, Drew, our server was personable, gave great recommendations and was attentive without being overbearing.  The ambiance is phenomenal as it feels very relaxing and comfortable.  The build out is awesome from the wood plank ceilings to the southern style bar!  The food had tremendous flavor, was well prepared and very original; a decent amount of options for non-pork eaters too.  Highly recommend great times had by all, thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of chef derived restaurants, so we have to start with 5 stars and go from there. We not only eat with our mouth but with our eyes and ears. The energy in this place at dinner is \"high throttle\" and that can be fun, but the noise level makes it difficult to have a conversation with dinner mates. Gumbo, collard greens, bread all satisfied my desire for southern food. Gumbo is outstanding, collard greens advertised \"ham hocks\" except we could barely find ham. All in all, Southern Rail is a must go to restaurant in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"My colleague and I stopped here to kill a couple hours before a meeting. They have a great selection of whiskeys, a couple local beers on tap and a good selection of wine. We ordered a couple light bites - the rice balls were tasty despite the unattractive sauce they were presented in and fried green tomatoes were delicious dressed in this amazing pepper aioli. The bar is partly inside and outside and much of the restaurant  opens up to a nicely landscaped patio.  The only downside of this place was our server - pretty unfriendly. I think we were there at the changing of shifts. I arrived  excited about the selection of whiskeys and my partner was happy his favorite beer was on tap but we left feeling meh. Maybe we'll try again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Had brunch here with my girlfriends over the weekend.  It was a perfect Sunday so we sat outside.  Our server was very friendly.  I ordered the cuban po boy sandwich with a side of gumbo.  The cuban was delish and paired perfectly with the mustard and pickles.  I enjoyed every bite!!  The gumbo was also very tasty.  We also ordered some beignets to share and they were perfectly fluffy, warm and chewy.  There was an overkill of the powdered sugar, but we aren't complaining!! There are several other items on the menu that I definitely wanted to try so this just means that we need to come back again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many more times and each time has been fantastic. Their desserts are to die for as well as there cornbread muffins. That Honey Pepper butter is so delish!"}
{"text":"My son got us a gift card for Christmas.  We had tried to eat there a few weeks ago but it was after the lunch hour and they had just closed to start getting ready for dinner. It was our anniversary and we arrived around 5:30. Offered seating inside or on the patio.  Southern Rail is located on Camelback along side the light rail. If you did not know they were there you would probably miss them. Parking lot is small. At the rush hour it will be hard to find a spot.  Not sure what you call the decor. The tables are made of channel iron and angle iron with wood set in for the top. Very simple. Waiters all had on blue  jean.  The decor and the dress of the waiters made me feel very comfortable.  We chose to eat on the patio. There were so many tables inside, looked cluttered.  Patio was great. Nice relaxed atmosphere plenty of room.  Ty was our waiter and did a superb job. Seemed to just know when we needed something. Spent time to answer questions. I wanted the blackened prime flatiron but the pairing of the vegetables was not what I wanted and they were not willing to substitute what I wanted. And that is fair. Everyone has their rules.  I got the chicken with biscuit dumplings. The meal was very taste. Definitely a good choice. Just a comment, the dumplings were not cooked on the broth. They were oven cooked, cut up and added to the chicken. I am from the south and I have never had or would call these dumplings. This does not mean I did not enjoy the meal. Just that is not how it is done in the South.  When I go back I will again sit on the patio. Very relaxing, even with the street noise, which was not so loud that it made conservation hard.  Oh! My wife had fried chicken and it looked delicious and she said it was very good. Plenty left for a meal at home.  I will definitely be back. Give them a try. If you luck out you will get Ty for a waiter."}
{"text":"First time here. The Fried chicken was to die for. The service was excellent and friendly. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Decided to have easter brunch here. The server was top notch but handicapped by the ridiculous rules where they \"can't\" split checks. This is the age of technology but they refuse to make life easier for their guests.   Also ordered the French toast. Not good. Should have ordered the poor boy. Don't make the mistake I made."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner!  We took the family and really enjoyed our dinner.  Child size portions were big enough to feed multiple kids.  The pork loin was sweet and well complimented with sweet potatoes and collard greens.  Hubby had the fried chicken that was juicy, freshly made and exceeded expectations.   Our waitress was not only friendly and fast, but was extremely knowledgeable about the menu.  Best waitress we've had in a long while!   Prices were a tad high for family dining, but the atmosphere was beautiful and plate presentation was top notch.  We will return for date night!"}
