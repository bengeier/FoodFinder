{"text":"I am a coffee snob. There, I said it. More times than not, I am super disappointed with  what some stores are shilling as espresso. I mean, a shot of espresso (or three) is the best way to judge a coffee shop, in my opinion, because it is the coffee at its finest, yet still incredibly simple. And to be honest, the espresso I had at Gallup (soon to be Crescendo Espresso Bar and Music Cafe!!!!!) was probably the best I have ever had. Which is saying something, because I've tried some amazing coffee in my time in Rome, Paris, and of course Zingermans in Ann Arbor, MI.  The tiny little cup filled with dark, rich, and bold espresso smelled heavenly and tasted even better. Oh, and strong. LIKE WOAH strong. But of course, that's how I like it.  I was all about the interior (total coffee house vibe with plush chairs and tables for a group) and the staff was incredible. There is a new gluten free menu coming soon along with brand new owners. So far, I'm totes digging what they've done so far.  I WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Gallup is the place to grab a quick jolt of coffee or yummy snack if your on Monroe Street. I always get the latte and I have never been dissappointed. The employees are friendly and quick when your stopping in for a morning coffee to start the day."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. Kind of your average coffee shop, but in a good way."}
{"text":"I came in one day to work --barriques next door was just too loud and crowded to get anything done. The two ladies working were so friendly and cheerful. I had a big iced coffee that hit the spot! This may be my new go-to study spot"}
{"text":"THIS JUST IN... Two times now I've had the best... BEST iced coffee. Consistent and caramel-y in nature and just plain good! They must do some sort of a cold press because after they fill it up about 3/4 of the way they top it off with some water. Next time I go I'll ask for details, but trust me when I say it's the best I've found in Madison next to Intelligentsia at Johnson Public House. Add to this the fact that the woman helping me today remembered to fill it to the top (no room for cream), said hello when I came in, have a good day when I left... all these things will make it so I spend quite a bit of remote work time at one of their tables. I still don't know why reviews are slim, but I'm ok with the fact that folks think Barriques on Monroe and their cornucopia of wine, beer, coffee and tea offerings are better. More room for me at Gallup!"}
