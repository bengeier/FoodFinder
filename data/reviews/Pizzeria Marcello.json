{"text":"**Sad to say Pizzeria Marcello is no more.  They closed up.  We're very disappointed.\" I really hesitated with regard to this review; I am a little selfish.  I would like to keep this gem a secret but I can't, that wouldn't be fair.  Marcello's has become our \"pizza and sub\" place; we wouldn't think of ordering from anywhere else now.    The taste is out of this world.  The tomato sauce actually tastes like garden fresh tomatoes.  The toppings are fresh, the pizza dough and the sub buns as well.  You don't feel like you need to have your lips and fingers de-greased.  I can't recommend Marcello's enough - the best pizza, by far.  This is the bar, set higher and the other restaurants will have a very hard time, even coming close."}

{"text":"Great reviews so wanted to try since I remembered Marcello from previous pizzeria he worked at!  Fabulous pizza; lots of toppings and the crust is delicious! Fast service too. Great specials as well for bigger groups or appetites! I ordered the Marcello special pizza (meat lovers pizza) and no complaints! Filled with lots of meats and usual veggies.  Reasonable prices as well. They deliver and you can eat there too otherwise call and pick up !  Would be great  if discount was offered for pickups .  The girl who takes orders was not the cheerful type rather standoffish in my opinion. But anyway well worth to try !  Heard the submarines are delicious as well but did not try yet.  Will be on my next choice! Enjoy and Bon appetit!"}
