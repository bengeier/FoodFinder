{"text":"Deli Planet is located underground at the Montreal train station/Gare centrale under the Queen Elizabeth Hotel. It serves business people working in the buildings nearby and tourists catching the train. It has two entrances but both can be difficult to find. To get to the entrance at the bar side you have to pass many of the fast food restaurants. The other entrance is at far end of the station facing gate 19. This is the second time I ate here with my family. They have a kids menu. Breakfast is very good and well priced. There are daily lunch specials. The menu has burgers, pizza, salads, smoked meat, pasta, sandwiches, etc. 
My husband enjoyed the hamburger and I had an amazing salad! We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"It's an ok restaurant. Food tastes alright, but I find it's overpriced for what they serve.

They've recently renovated the place...and their prices. 

I only went because of a colleague's birthday lunch, but I would never go on my own with friends and family."}
{"text":"La serveuse a vraiment l'air de vouloir être ailleurs, mais on ne peut pas la blâmer, c'est l'heure du lunch a la gare centrale et elle doit s'occuper d'au moins la moitié du restaurant a elle seule. Un bonjour mou, aucun sourire, elle lance presque le change de mon copain sur la table lors du paiement... très moyen.

La bouffe est pas chère et correct, et arrive en peu de temps. J'ai pris le spaghetti viande fumée, la portion était énorme. Les nouilles trop cuites, bref, j'en ai eu pour mon argent. La pizza de mon chum semblait ordinaire. Mais vu le prix,on ne s'attend pas a de la grande classe.

Une chance que j'étais en excellente compagnie !"}
{"text":"Service was great and accommodating. Anything below a three star is unfair. This is a restaurant in the train station. I'd say I've had worse but I really find that unfair to a LOT of restaurants. It's the equivalent of \"you could do better\", and that is really unfair. This restaurant met all of my expectations and I left happy.

Food was to be expected. We ordered the nachos to share; they were typical bar nachos and the beer was always in my glass. If you were looking to kill some time underground (especially waiting for a train) this really is a good place to chill with a drink."}
{"text":"So my father-in-law, my husband and I had breakfast here recently.  We were catching the train back to Ottawa, so there wasn't much selection at the Train Station.  The only things open that morning were Tim Hortons, Second Cup, Saint Cinnamon, that big place right near the main hall that is somewhat reminiscent of Mövenpick Marché (sorry, don't remember the name) and Deli Planet.  My father-in-law wanted a sit down restaurant, so Deli Planet it was.  

You can't really mess breakfast up that much, so take this review for what it is.  I had 2 eggs poached, bacon, home fries, toast, fruit and coffee.  The eggs were nicely poached (not too runny, but not too hard), the bacon was crispy, the home fries were also crispy and much better than home fries at most diners, and I requested the toast dry and it came dry (hurray!  You won't believe the number of times I get buttered toast at restaurants, despite requesting dry toast!).  The fruit was a fruit salad with mostly cantaloupe and honeydew (the yuckiest fruits ever, in my opinion) and a few apples and grapes.  The coffee was satisfactory.  No real complaints from me (other than the yucky fruit salad).  My husband asked for his eggs over hard and they arrived over easy.  My father-in-law requested his eggs sunny side up and although they did arrive sunny side up, he said the yolk was a little too runny for his liking.  The 2 eggs breakfast was about $7 I think.        

Service was competent.  Decor is like a typical train station / airport restaurant.  

Not a bad experience, but nothing that spectacular either."}
{"text":"I'm giving it four stars to counter the ridiculous ratings given below. The place is not fine dining. It's not meant to be. It's good food with good attentive service. I ate there with my wife three times before I even looked up the place on Yelp. True, the smoked meat is not corned beef or pastrami, both of which are not smoked but cured. The smoked meat sandwich I ate was plentiful and the meat was tender. Breakfast was comparable to any \"diner\" breakfast that I have had, and I am from New Jersey, the land of diners. The cole slaw, which I had twice was very good with flavor. The only thing I was unhappy with was that they didn't have ice cream for dessert. I was offered rice pudding or maple cake. I had the cake and it was so so."}

Deli Man!!!

Who?

Yeah exactly...Deli Man is the superhero that welcomes you to this mess of a fast food joint in Montreal's Deli Planet restaurant.

Picture Applebees minus the bad food. Yes it is that bad!

Now granted, the location I visited was directly below my hotel. In Montreal they have an Underground City, which comes in handy when the weather is bad outside. Oh and it was bad. On a -30 degree day in this beautiful city I went underground and came across this happy looking place.

I was in the mood for bad food. By \"bad\", I mean \"greasy,cheese filled and fun\" food...not \"wtf is this?\" food.

Anyways here is what I ordered:

Appetizer: Nachos Macho. Yes that is what it is called. No I did not call it that to the waiter. I hate places that give their food items stupid names, I am not saying \"fruity tooty fresh and fruity\" at IHOP and I will not say \"Moons over My Hammy\" at Denny's! Just say pancaked or scrambled eggs dammit!

Oh yeah back to my review...now while I love my nachos...but this big bowl of chips with melted cheese, salsa, sour cream and jalapeno was just a big bowl of yuck. It came out cold and the chips tasted stale. I told them that the chips were cold, they offered to \"warm\" them up. Really? Are you going to nuke this mess and bring back a Nachos Macho Soup? I said I was not happy with this and they just stood there with a blank stare. I said I would not pay for this and the guy just walked away. Ha!?

Main Course: Ordered the BBQ chicken. Meh...not going to say it was the worse chicken ever...but it surely was not tasty. Maybe because they gave me a side of mashed potatoes and the genius in the back poured mounds  and mounds of gravy all over my plate. I mean I love gravy, but this was ridiculous. Besides my gravy pool being everywhere, it was not even that good.

I skipped dessert (shocked?)...and paid my bill, minus the nacho chips. Told the woman at the front counter on my way out that I was not happy with them and to look at my table (which was in view) and said that they were still there untouched. She agreed...I paid...and left this joint.

Au Revoir."}
{"text":"For our weekly Friday lunch at the office, the male colleagues really wanted to see the tennis match, so they decided to go to the Deli Planet. 

Deli Planet looks a lot like a Cage aux Sports: big TVs or screens, similar colours, and pop-corn machines. Basically, this is a place to watch sport games. 

This place is lost in the middle of the train station. Had I gone by myself, I would've gotten lost. 

My male colleagues raved about the grilled steak. That's what they ordered. I had chicken wings and a salad, instead of the fries. My plate was by far the biggest, but 75% of it was vegetables. The 10 wings were good, although I should say 9 wings since one of them was 95% fat and bones. I liked the BBQ sauce which was a little spicy but mostly salty. The blue cheese dip didn't really taste like blue cheese. Price: $14. 

The male colleagues ordered the table d'hôtes, which came with a soup, main course, dessert and coffee. They all ordered the chocolate cake. However, it was more a white cake with a little bit of chocolate frosting... 

Conclusion: I won't go back, but if you're at the train station and crave Cage aux Sports-like food, that's the place to go."}
{"text":"A good friend and I decided to catch up after work for a bite ... amongst many delicious choices, we chose Deli-Planet. The food was good and fresh! 
The portions were generous. 
Service was okay- 

This restaurant's theme is on point! Cool names for their dishes which lives up to every bite."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat, of you like chicken burgers you have to try the Metropolis it's very good. 

The ambiance is nice, the service is ok. The bar area is nice but could be a little cheaper, specially for the draft beer. 

In general I like and go pretty often. 

3 stars for the restaurant, 4 stars for the Metropolis burger."}
{"text":"Great deli!! A bit off the grid in the train station but huge restaurant with delicious deli favorites like smoked meat, poutine, brochettes, club sandwiches etc. The food is always good with nice sized portions and moderately priced. If you want the best service you've ever had, ask for Soto."}
{"text":"We came here two mornings as part of a tour group for breakfast.  The service was fast, friendly and accommodating.  The place was clean, the food was great, the prices are reasonable.  I would recommend this place.  For a large group to have great service for all is honestly a hard task, but they pulled it off!  Please go and give this place a shot...cool décor as well!"}
{"text":"Wandered in here the other day though I'd passed by it many times before. Had a spaghetti with soda. Decent though I wish they wouldn't drown the pasta in sauce. Service was very slow, only two wait staff people- not really acceptable when the place was so incredibly empty. Anyways, not bad but not anything to write home about."}
{"text":"It was raining above and we found ourselves wandering around the underground city.  When hunger set in, we found ourselves in front of the DP.  The signage was funny and I thought, what the heck.  The lone worker said we could sit anywhere.  There were a couple of families and some other wayward people eating.  It's also adjacent to the central train station, so I'm sure this place is a zoo on a busy day.  

We ordered a bottle of wine....I mean...why not?  I also ordered the poutine to share.  Not bad, but not authentic.  Made with mozzarella, gravy, and some limp fries.  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with a salad.  Really huge portion of the salad, which was dressed well.  The burgers that came out were good, but the same limp fries came out with.  Granted, given the location, this is not a gourmet foodie kind of place, but a kitchy kind of diner.

It's not a bad place to grab a meal.  Some of the other items on the menu looked promising.  But if you ever find yourself wandering down in the underground, this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Drunk at 6PM, dancing midle-aged Women on Dance music!?
WTF!

I had munchies with friends and we were waiting for the next train so we ate there. Ok meal. Just average let's be frank. I took time to have somebody serve us. Just beside, people finishing work, people drunk at 6pm. Felt wrong. Funny thing is that they look like they have usuals. Which really struck me like a Loser's Paradise. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Loser,s Paradise, they're allowed to have their place too. Confort food, cheap price, waiting for the train and tired of Shish Taouk or General Tao? Could be a good tryout-once-in-a-lifetime-place. I wouldn't want to have to eat there again!  At least I know what this place's food I pass by everyday taste like!"}
{"text":"My order was a classic poutine which was good, service was adequate however the prices in the Deli Planet is a bit over price."}
{"text":"It's a bad sign when I spent my whole my meal gazing at the adjacent middle Eastern eatery across the food court.  Yes, this place in in the Underground, right by the train station (train, not metro).  My husband picked this place, and I was leery of it from the get-go.

He order the smoked meat sandwich, which Montreal is known for.  Apparently Deli Planet is not known for it, however, because he said it tasted like \"shaved, old hot dogs\" piled onto bread.  I almost vomited in my mouth right then.

Since nothing on the menu looked good to me for the price, I decided to \"keep it simple\" and order the half grilled cheese/half salad plate.  The grilled cheese, no lie, was two pieces of small square bread with processed cheese.  That might have been okay had it not bee DROWNING in grease.  I couldn't finish it.  The salad was edible, but was drowning in some sort of \"special creamy\" dressing.

Our waitress was a complete b****, too.  Stay away!"}
{"text":"restaurant américain qui offre une variété de menu à bon prix.  cela ressemble à un barbies ou Boston pizza. Un bar est aussi présent pour ceux qui préfère prendre un apéro. 

L'ambiance est celle d'un journal de superhero,  comme le daily bugle. tout les éléments du menu sont des clin d'oeil à cela comme un Burger Dr.  doom par exemple. 

La quantité dans la assiettes est suffisante pour remplir la grande majorité des appétit.  on ne parle pas des petites portions de la cage au sport. 

tant qu'à la qualité,  il ne s'agit pas ici de grande gastronomie mais à date rien ne ma déçu. J'ai tester plusieurs hamburger,  un sandwich au poulet,  le smoke Meat... Les assiettes et la qualités sont parfais pour le prix demandé.

Pour un repas simple entre ami,  c'est une bonne place."}
