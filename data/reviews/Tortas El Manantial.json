{"text":"Tortas Pierna are excellent! Always get it and its always good. Try the Energetic Juice too! Service was good and fast."}
{"text":"The tortas are alright not enough to make you come back too expensive in my opinion for such small sandwich. Also cashier never greets us not sure why and the girls take a long time to make 2 tortas when it's practically empty then they were even calling out the wrong name so 30 mins later my bf finally goes in asks what happen and they calling him by a different name. Kinda stupid how could she not remember who order what and keep calling out for the wrong person"}
{"text":"Son demasiado lentas las trabajadoras de ahí. Aunque pidas la orden por teléfono no la tienen lista. Very very slow service!!! 

También la música que tienen siempre ahí siento como si me fueran a disparar ahí adentro. 

Que consigan buenas trabajadoras no buchonas!!!"}
{"text":"I personally really enjoy their food, if you get a torta you HAVE TO add some of their torta sauce it's what makes the taste great. And you can't go wrong with any of their aguas either."}
{"text":"they make it when you order! All their drinks are made with fresh fruit I've tried almost all of them and they are BOMB i recommend trying the cubana make sure your cheese is melted and don't forget the secret sauce thats my favorite part!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Spot when craving a torta!i love their secret sauce, although I have an idea of what it really is. Anyways, they have Reasonable prices and really good food. I also love their licuados ( although a bit pricy $4-$5 each ) I always get the chicken torta"}
{"text":"cashier had a horrible attitude and had the biggest bitch face ever. Huge ass fucking eyelashes looking like she about to fly away from everyone's bullshit. All the girls there are rude and they never smile. Look like they hate their job, as if it's my fault that they're working @ a damn torta joint. customer service sucks in general. I enjoyed the food but the females there just make it a shitty place, with their attitudes and not friendly service. If you're gonna work somewhere, why not be friendly and try to at least enjoy your damn job? Also they play shitty messssican music

1 STAR FOR THE CRAPPY SERVICE. 
4 for the food or whatevaaaa"}
{"text":"Tortas are excellent. I definitely recommend a torta hawaiana and a strawberry water All drinks are freshly made very tasty, with natural fruit. Plus You get a positive vibe from the beautiful ladies that work there!"}
{"text":"Not the best tortas, they're very skimpy on their meat. I payed 6.00 for 1 torta and it wasn't worth it at all.  I waited about 10-15 minutes and they had about six girls working. I really don't understand why it took so long, I placed my order and then went to subway to order 2 footlongs and came back to pick up my order and i still had to wait. I'll never come back again, not the best service, or food and they weren't even busy. Tortas paquime are way way better and you get a lot more meat.... next time I'll drive a little out of my way....I was pretty disappointed but lesson learned"}
{"text":"I was trying to look for a place that sold Tortas de cochinita for the longest time. I was recommended here by a family friend and I have to say I did love the bread. BUT the first time I tasted the bread my aunt had bought it from this restaurant to make her own Tortas. The time that I actually went into the restaurant they kind of toasted my bread a little too much. The torta hawaiana was good but not as great as I thought it would be. It needed more flavor. The customer service is not all that great either. Will I come again? Yeah maybe. Especially for their aguas frescas, those were great"}
{"text":"This used to be a bomb place but not anymore. The place was so dirty, when we walked in and the place was empty. One girl was hard at work while the other girls were just there messing around. The horchata's were disgusting, so never get them. The music was on blast, I'm all for having fun at work but to some extent, when a family is trying to have a conversation and can't hear each other I think that's a problem."}
{"text":"The food is great they are one of my favorite Tortas but the customer service is horrible!!! The girls there are so rude and have a big attitude problem. They never say thank you or welcome you in."}
{"text":"Me gusta venir por las mañanas después de hacer hiking por un Jugo dietético con naranja, puedes pedirlo colocado o no, a mi me gusta sin colar para que tenga mas fibra!  siempre lo acompaño con un Sándwich de Atún con pan integral!! MUY RICO!"}
{"text":"Seriously best tortas in town... I'm not just saying that either. The girls who run this place make some killer shredded pork &  cheeken. Worth driving down to the hood fasho."}
{"text":"Best TORTA SHOP in Arizona! Recommend the Hawaiian or the Cubana! The shakes and natural fruit drinks are delicious!
Also very clean environment!"}
{"text":"Me encanta venir aquí asen muy rica limonada se las recomiendo siempre tienen fruta fresca excelente atención y buen servicio"}
{"text":"The best Tortas in town. I recommend the Cubana and Pierna. The secret sauce definitely makes the Tortas that much better! Plus their aguas frescas and pepihuates are also bomb! Everything is delicious! Plus they have great customer service. I always call ahead for my order (usually are big orders) and have never had an issue. Definitely have to try! :)"}
{"text":"I like their Tortas they aren't bad and their nachos are delicious.. But the wait is ridiculous. Just for regular nachos is like 15-20minutes wait. But now I just call and order. So I won't wait as long."}
{"text":"We came here as a recommendation from one of my customers and all I can say is WOW!  Where have tortas been all of my life?! Tried the #6 (chicken with tomato sauce) and the #7 (chicken with jalapeno juice) and they were both so yummy! The torta sauce was really good on both! They put avocado on the sandwiches and it was perfectly ripe -not too hard and not too soft. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I would recommend trying this place. I give it 3.5

Positives:
  I got the Torta Cubana which was very yummy! Their secret sauce is definitely good. It had a lot of flavor, definely NOT bland :)   It is very clean inside.  The girl who took my order was helpful and kind

Negatives:
 The bread is a bit more like a regular sub bread but thinner,  different from other Tortas I've had.  Not my favorite type of bread.   Could have had a bit more meat on the sandwich perhaps?  . I paid around $9 for a whole sandwich and a coke.  This seemed a little pricey to me.  The sandwich did not come with a side.

Tips:
   Overall.. I did like my sandwich!  I will be going back.  I say get the Cubana if you go."}
{"text":"The tortas are pretty good, I tried the pork torta and my friend tried the chicharrón torta, both of them were really good although the torta one was slightly dry but needless to say still very delicious. They give you a mayo chipotle bottle with your order so it helps with the flavor if you like that. I got the carrot juice and it was good as well as the mango fruit drink, it was not too sweet either. Nice little place, customer service was alright. :)"}
{"text":"BOMB BOMB BOMB! I'm not saying it cause we own the place but man they are DEE-LISH ! Don't believe me? Go try them lol I recommend the Cubana and Hawaiiana 
Everything else is bomb but those 2 are my personal fav!"}
{"text":"Este lugar esta de poca madre!!! La neta las tortas estan bien ricas!! Y los jugos ni se diga. Las muchachonas que trabajan aqui tmbn se dejan caer la greña!! Masizo!!"}
{"text":"Fruit Pico de gallo is bomb!  If  you are looking for a bomb fruit salad the fruit pico de Gayo is definitely the way to go they do it up right!"}
{"text":"My sandwich was just fine. Not bad but not 5 stars either. I did not really care very much for the taste of it all but but I think that was more me than the sandwich. Otro Cafe has a five star Torta for sure and this was just not comparable. They do not have Carne Asada on the menu which was very disappointing. They have a lot of pork options but I rarely eat pork. I had the chicken and they do have a veggie option on the menu. I did not partake in any of the juices but they have a lot of them if that is your thing."}
