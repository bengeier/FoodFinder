{"text":"Yummy! If you order the Pad Thai ask for the original (withTamarind) to avoid ketchup. Sweet server, comfortable atmosphere, and well priced."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just the specific dish that I ordered, but Bua Thai has some of the better Thai food that I've had in a long time.  Had the Winter Rolls to start; nice and fresh, crisp and comes along with a tangy/spicy dipping sauce to boot.  For my entree, I had the Spicy Basil Noodle with Chicken. Generally speaking, if a Thai restaurant has a good Spicy Basil (sometimes Spicy Basil Leaf, or Thai Basil Leaf), it should be a good indication that it has some other good Thai dishes. For the record, Bua Thai has one of the top Spicy Basil dishes that I've ever had. The noodles were not soggy (I hate that), the peppers and onions were crisp, there wasn't TOO much basil leaf (which for me gets annoying), the chicken was evenly cut and tender, and the sauce gave things a good kick.  My cousin got the Red Curry, and he was happy with it.  Bottom line, I'm a fan of this place."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE WE'VE EVER EXPERIENCED. TWO HOURS OF PHONING TO TRY TO GET THIS SORTED OUT. We tried ordering food at 7:30. The food arrived at 8:30. It was the WRONG order. I called to let them know. They said they would call the driver. We waited and waited, no call back. We called them again. They said the driver was on his way (presumably with the right order?). We waited. We called again at 9 (an hour and a half after ordering). They didn't seem to know what I was talking about. I explained again. They said they'd call the driver. We waited. We called again, explained we received the wrong order. They put us on hold for a long while. By now it was too late; we said we wanted a refund. They said we would have to return the food--wow!!! The driver picked up the food at 9:30--of course did not happen to have the correct order for us. So now I'm waiting to see if they're cancelling the Visa charge--if they charge me, I'm calling the Better Business Bureau."}
{"text":"This restaurant sincerely sticks to their Thai roots. The tom yum soup has a great depth of flavour, while my wife's wonton soup had a light but tasty broth.  As entrees we had the peanut curry and pad khah Mao (Thai spicy noodles)... The curry is probably their best selling item as it's amazing (others in restaurant were ordering it). Their spicy noodles were spicy but flavorful, not overpowering.  I would definitely come back...a definite great Thai experience!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good i always order it for delivery just because its close and not too expensive. I only ate in the restaurant once and the service was pretty bad my mother didnt like the salad she got so she asked for something instead and the waiter got so angry at her and kept on defending the meal and that she was wrong for thinking that. That kind of turned us off so we got the food packed up and we left."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the first time since moving west from downtown. Tried Nimman Thai and the this was 100 times better! We had the tom yum shrimp, papaya salad, pad Thai, red curry chicken, and stir fried vegetables with tofu. Each dish was prepared with fresh ingredients And very flavorful! Will be making this restaurant our new go to place for Thai food. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food was average, perhaps because we had their lunch special.    Having said that would have gone back to try ala carte dinner, had the service been good.  Unfortunately the service was incredibly slow with only two servers on a jam pack lunch crowd.  Our three orders came in piece meal rather then being served at the same time, didn't feel like we had a full Thai experience.    Sorry Bua Thai, we tried but going back to Green Mango on Bloor"}
{"text":"Every dish we have ordered has been fresh and tasty& delivery arrives piping hot and quick. This is a place we've ordered from when tired from the work week or with friends and each time everyone's enjoyed it very much. Love the jasmine rice with any version of their coconut curries. Spring rolls are not greasy unlike a lot of other delivery places, and their fried wontons are great. Mango salad is made with nice ripe mangos , their chinese broccoli very good."}
{"text":"I love this place! My favourite order is tofu satay, which comes with a nice peanut dipping sauce, and KTM which is a vegan dish with shiitake mushrooms and chinese spinach (or spanich as their menu says!) I have also ordered curry there, and they were very accommodating about making it without fish sauce for me. I have also tried a spicy eggplant dish (I can't remember if it was actually called spicy eggplant but it had a lot of eggplant and was very spicy!) It was also very good, but too spicy for me.  Not all of the servers speak english very well but they are all very friendly, at least when I've been. I have only had one slightly negative experience, and it was nothing too major: once when I got take out, they forgot to include the peanut sauce for my tofu satay. It turns out that the sauce is where all the flavour comes from, so the satay was very disappointing that day. Aside from that my experiences have all been positive."}
{"text":"Wonderful family owned restaurant.  Food is prepared fresh with quality ingredients and the staff are just lovely.  They have an especially good $10 lunch special weekdays that is great value.  Delivery or eat in option.  By far the best and most reasonable Thai restaurant in the area, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and each time I am more impressed. They seem to be listening to feedback from customers and are making improvements.   The food is great, good portion sizes and fresh. Great value. Try \"The Duo\" appetizer, you won't be disappointed by the crispy taro and fried tofu with peanut sauce. Nice ginger honey tea with your dessert will leave you feeling happy.   One recent poster on Yelp commented the they would not make substitutions for vegetarians... I couldn't disagree more. We were dining with a vegan and they made every substitution you could want. They have tofu or veg as an option for almost all dishes. I would say that easily 2/3 of the menu was or could be made vegetarian by choosing the tofu option.   Recommended. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great Thai for the area. Friendly service and good atmosphere. We enjoy the green curry and have ordered quite a few other dishes.  Their chicken lemongrass soup is quite nice on a cold day.  This is our go-to place in the hood if we're feeling like Thai."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome Pad Thai and tamarin curry. Fish cake appetizer was the best fish cakes I've ever eaten!! Thank you for the coconut rice from heaven!!"}
{"text":"We love the pad Thai at this place - it's the best in the area! The food is reasonably priced, and the service is great. The summer rolls are also very good."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! I didn't try the pad Thai, but did a family style with 3 other people. We had the fish, Bua Thai platter, Beef Green Curry, and a duck red curry. Everything was perfectly seasoned and had the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"One of the rare places in Toronto that offer Authentic & Real Thai food. The ambience in this place is very nice, very relaxing. The food quality is very good, and they have many choices. The portions are also decent for the price you pay. I definitely recommend this if you are looking for Authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Bua Thai is okay but doesn't live up to its advance billing.  None of the dishes stood out as anything special except for the Winter rolls which were excellent.  The vegetable soup and coconut soup were very average.  The traditional pad thai which came in a thin egg crepe was fine but nothing special.  Same with the other two dishes we had but whose names I can't recall.  Very pedestrian thai food."}
{"text":"I am big fun of authentic pad thai but there is so many ketchup based pad thai out there which I hate. However, this place also served the ketchup one.  When I asked the waitress, she said they can give me a authentic pad thai which based on tamarind sauce! No extra charge.  .....I LOVE IT. Chicken and shrimp was very soft....well cooked.  Service was excellent!! Very homey.  I would like to try green curry next time."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, we'd order from here weekly for delivery.  We moved out of the delivery area (barely) and they could not make a 1 minute exception to their normal area of delivery. That said my wife and I went back for the first time in a year and I was greatly disappointed by the soggy fish cakes, I had to drown them in their sweet and spicy sauce. My pad thai had a ketchup taste to it, the sort experience I expect from a thai + chinese + japanese food place in some small town. I tried my wifes pad thai hor khai, and it tasted like it had campbell soup onion base in it.  I don't know if this place changed ownership or what, but I am greatly saddened to lose one of my favourite places to eat."}
{"text":"Seating arrangement and the place in general was very spacious. Food was good but I have had better Pad thai in Toronto. But don't know, for some reason the attendants kept cleaning the floor the entire time we spent there.."}
{"text":"Service is always great. Food we get is always fresh and yummy with great serving size-if ever you have a request or question they will ask/usually fulfill it. Very clean and the ambiance is generally nice. The only thing is they should have better hours!"}
{"text":"I am Thai. I was traveling to Toronto and stopped by for dinner. restaurant 's decoration was nice. Waitstaff was nice. But the taste of the food needs to be improved!. Do not order \"Chicken cashew nuts\" (picture is shown in the menu). It tastes terrible .. only sweet ... I could not believe how could they make this sweet"}
{"text":"Had some trouble finding it but this is apparently their new location that opened up in the plaza across from the No Frills. Service was attentive, and while it was not the best Thai food I've eaten, it was decent to satisfy my craving.  I went with what Yelpers suggested and got the pad thai and asked for it with tamarind sauce (so you don't get the ketchup) - this was very tasty and a hit amongst my party. Recommend.  I ordered some kind of red curry which was just a tad too spicy, but alright overall.  Someone mentioned they liked the pineapple fried rice, but this dish fell below my expectations. I personally didn't find it flavorful enough and quite bland/un-memorable. I think this was the dish that had leftovers...  Not the best Thai I've eaten, and probably not somewhere I would venture to again, but not a bad choice if you're in the area and you're craving some Thai food."}
{"text":"The place is small but the food is amazing and the service is fast the food was on the table in 10min..would totally recommend it we had the chicken and shrimp pad Thai and the red curry amazing"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I lived downtown for 15 years and was spoiled for choice, but I find the food here mediocre at best. With downtown Thai restaurants like Khao San Road offering up real five star fare, I would only eat here because I live within walking distance and Mimico options are limited.   I can't speak for the meat dishes, but the vegetarian options are bland, salty, and uninspired. When I eat out, I want to feel the love, and at Bua Thai, I don't even feel the like.   That said, my parents really like the food here. Mind you, they moved here from Pickering, so..."}
{"text":"Fresh thai and great service. Curries are rich and flavourful, try the peanut chicken curry. Fresh rolls are crisp and light.  If you ask for spicy, they deliver. Looking forward to getting through the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Peanut Curry Chicken is amazing!!!! Only thing if you want to order off their lunch menu you need to order well before 3:00. We arrived at 2:50 and were told it was too late."}
{"text":"Decent Thai food. Nothing out of the world"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. Lunch specials are terrific. Choice of main +soup+spring rolls. for under $10. Excellent potions.  Eaten dinner here too. Perfect portions and really well done flavours. I think the cook must love their job... I can taste it in the food.  Wonderful ambience and excellent service. Restaurant is clean and welcoming, warm feeling. Washrooms are spotless. I think many restaurants can take lessons from Bua Thai's level of cleanliness.  Thank you for making my experience so great."}
{"text":"Ordered the Curry Chicken lunch special for pick up. Came with 2 spring rolls, jasmine rice, jasmine rice, and soup - $11. Food is delicious! Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Four of us just stopped in for dinner and its a sure bet we'll be back, and probably soon.  Now, it wasn't 'amazing' but it was certainly delicious and enjoyable, with a comfortable atmosphere.  The staff was very nice and accommodating with a couple of special requests."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here from start to finish a few weeks ago.  We ordered fried shrimp as apps. Pad thai and Green Curry as mains. Fried banana as dessert. All in all, large portions, satisfying flavour and not badly priced."}
{"text":"I like this for a local Etobicoke Thai restaurant. I usually always order the same thing. Sticky rice and tofu mango stir fry. It's always good. They don't accept debit which is a little annoying."}
{"text":"I've been to Bua Thai twice now, and both experiences were good. The service can be a little slow, but not terribly so. The prices are pretty in-line with other restaurants in the area. The menu selection is fairly large.  I met a friend there for lunch today. She had the Tom Yum soup, we shared crispy WonTons, and both had the Crispy Tamarind Chicken with sides of Coconut Rice. Everything was tasty! You do have to order a side of rice separately, which is a small irritation. I'm used to Thai restaurants providing a side of Jasmine rice (at least) with the entree, and giving you the option to \"upgrade\" to sticky rice or coconut rice for a small charge.  But overall, we were happy."}
{"text":"I stepped in to this place one day after work around 4pm, weekday. I recently just moved into the area so I wanted to compare it to my favourite Thai restaurant.. Hence the 4 stars. I ordered pad Thai and fried shrimp rolls. While I waited I had a beer and the host was very friendly and talkative. The owners were nice as well and didn't take long to have my food ready. When I got home and tried the food it was amazing. The pad Thai was delicious and reasonably portioned. The shrimp wasn't bad but they can do better for the price and portion. Wouldn't stop me from going back though and it seems like a great place for a date or gathering. I pass by when I walk my dog and it's always busy."}
{"text":"Awesome food every single time. Used to have take-outs and had dine in few times. Always jam packed and atmosphere is really nice and clean. Staff always friendly and have smile on their faces. Really a gem on west end of city. You must try. My fav dishes are pad-thai(ask with tamarind sauce), pineapple fried rice with chicken and shrimp, delicious mango salad."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the positive reviews. Our food was mediocre at best. I've had much better Thai almost everywhere else. I had the basil chicken and it was far too salty and lacked flavour. The noodles were overcooked and sticky. On the plus side, the chicken pieces were very good but it could not make up for a bland overly salty dish. 5/10."}
{"text":"I have to say this is the best Thai restaurant in this area. My nails salon is just down the street, which 3 mins walk to come here. Very close for me to come for dinner. You have to ask for the rolls. I think they have best roll, smell freshly done. Nice peoples, good services, clean atmosphere. Sorry, i want to give 10 stars but they only allows to do 5 :)) LOL"}
{"text":"I  read some of the reviews before ordering...I always get worried about whatI'm going to expect when I eat Thai food. There are so many different flavours and I have had really bad Thai before. Anyways I ordered the basil noodle with chicken...pretty good. I usually go for this dish. I also ordered spring rolls, but I was so full I couldn't really enjoy them, but they didn't taste too bad."}
{"text":"Been to Bua Thai 3 times in a month now. Excellent food, big portions, never too busy, extremely quick and friendly service. One of my favourite restaurants in Etobicoke, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Isn't it funny that you always miss the closes gem in your neighbourhood. I used to live in the area and never had a chance to visit this place. Anyway, I am so glad that I finally visited this place. The decor is very nice inside. The service is also great. We had medium expectations about the food, but that turned out to be wrong. Now I am not a Thai food fan. Primarily went due to popularity vote from the family, but oh boy, was it good! It was the best Thai meal I ever had. My brother frequently visits all the premium Thai joints in Toronto and he found this place comparable or even better. We had three different curries and they were all very tasty. I personally prefer mine, which was the red curry with roasted duck option. And finally, don't forget to try the mango sticky rice dessert. It is really worth it and big enough to be shared between 2-3 people."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times and it's pretty decent but by no means would it be my first choice for Thai food. It is close to where I live so if I happen to want Thai this is the most convenient place to go, not too pricey either."}
{"text":"it's a shame about this place--they have such great potential. they use fresh, quality ingredients and the menu is fairly authentic.  but there's nothing worse than finishing a meal and regretting the fact that you paid for it (or how much you paid for it). when you finish a good meal, that you paid for it, isn't even on your mind.  we ordered at 8:45pm. they close at 10pm, stop taking delivery orders at 9pm. when the food arrived, the delivery driver mentioned that it would be nice if we could order earlier. he mentioned that they asked him if he would deliver it and he was going to say \"no\" but then he looked at the address and remembered that he delivered here before. he mentioned all of this before he was tipped. (it's a good thing that my partner was the one who answered the door!) my partner said that perhaps he should talk to his boss about their delivery hours. the driver quickly, said, \"no, no, it's just that it's late, you know?\". so that was the appetizer--guilt.  as my partner pulled out the styrofoam container, there was a black curly hair stuck to the top of it. my partner is blond and bald.   I ordered a lemongrass soup and a salad. like I said, fresh ingredients and the soup was tasty. but it was spicy. and that was not indicated on the menu, and the reason I chose it. (I like spicy, but I was sick.)  the salad: the beef was sinewy (when an adult has to pull chewed-up bits of food out of their mouth, you know it's bad), and it came with the dressing on it so everything was wilted*.  there was also dressing on the side, which was hardly necessary, because it looked like a soup was in the container. and the type of \"dressing\" could only be described as \"beef\". beef dressing.   *the salad was wilted because the hot food was packed with the cold food. and then probably put in some contraption to keep the order hot while it traveled from point a to point b. two fantastic ideas for a salad.  my partner's noodle dish was made vegetarian. as in, no chicken, no shrimp, sub tofu. they charged him the same price. all the other noodle dishes offer a price reduction with the vegetarian version option.   in sum, slightly more than mediocre but overall disappointing."}
{"text":"Always get the lemongrass tofu dish with mixed veggies and an order of rice. Best this food ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of their pad thai but their bua platter appetizer and their Thai noodle lemongrass soup are fantastic. Cashew Nut chicken is also good but not as good as other Thai places.  Prices are fair and the restaurant is very clean. Service is attentive and friendly.   It's located next to several other restaurants so finding parking out front might be a bit difficult. I would recommend parkingat the grocery store lot across the street."}
{"text":"2014..... No debit?!  Plus no immediate bank machine at that corner, get interac; it's about a decade+ late but you can still get on the technology wave.."}
{"text":"Very nice.   Reasonably priced, good service, food tasted fresh and came quickly.   I had the tamarind curry with veg.   We'll be back."}
{"text":"Our favourite go to restaurant! The service is great! The food is sooo yummy!  Anytime we recommend this place to people, they are happy about it! We did wish that it was open longer, earlier, etc depending on the day but its forgivable because of how good the food is! Please don't ever let that quality slip!"}
{"text":"Found plastic piece in my fried fish dish. Grilld pork was made with spoiled meat. Still got charged for the dish."}
{"text":"They have one of the best Thai food places in Toronto. Prices are very affordable as well. Well worth your visit."}
{"text":"We ordered the pineapple fried rice, green curry beef and bua platter. The rice was super flavourful and not greasy, they were also very accommodating and left out the shrimp for us. The green curry was rich with flavour and hit the spot. We also really enjoyed the spring rolls and satay in the platter. Wasn't a huge fan of the summer rolls, but that's personal preference. Keep up the good work and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great service & delicious food. Entrees are perfect size and the price is fair. We'll be back."}
{"text":"A nice, intimate dining experience. I am very picky when it comes to pad-thai but Bua has one of the best I've tried (in Etobicoke, anyway). All the appetizers are fantastic too and if you like curry, the curry dishes are worth a try as well. The staff is always the same every time I come and they're all very friendly and good at what they do!"}
{"text":"Nice presentation here, especially the appetizers.  The menu does not use Thai names for dishes, so if you are familiar with these, you'll have to match them up with the English descriptions.  Prices are about average.  As the previous reviewer mentioned, the food was not amazing but it does seem like it would be very reliable.   \"Summer rolls\" were very nice and the tom young had nice juicy prawns.  My pad kra pow had thinner noodles than the usual and could have used a bit more spiciness.  Decor is simple.  They seem to do a brisk delivery business in the area and have another location at Avenue and Davenport"}
{"text":"Great prices. Don't get the pad thai though - extremely greasy. The pineapple fried rice is out of this world and rice centered dish have that authentic taste.  Fast delivery and fast take-out. Park across the street at No Frills so you don't have to pay."}
{"text":"Food was 3.5-4 stars, easy to order and delivery was really quick and nice.  Had won ton soup - very tasty!  Lots of dumplings and good veg with nice broth.  Not too salty.  Fried chicken wontons - pretty crispy, good chicken stuffing.  Pad Thai - missed previous reviewers comment and had the more ketchup based one.  It was okay - more or less what you'd get anywhere.  Red curry chicken - quite tasty but not spicey which I was expecting.  Still good though.     Decent portions and seemed like ingredients were very fresh.  Nice colours on the veggies.  Will order again from here!"}
{"text":"Glad I had Yelp for this one, it was listed as the best Thai place in Etobicoke. 23 reviews on a place is higher than most as well. Really nice little restaurant, fair prices and service speed. Quite a few people there for a Wednesday dinner. Bua had a ton of vegetarian menu  options, more than most Thai restaurants. Everything tasted great!"}
{"text":"Just picked up some take out from Bua Thai on a rainy saturday night.  Everything we ordered was great!  1. Crispy Beef - still haven't found a beef that rivals Green Basil in the beach, but this is a great version of a crispy beef.  Very flavourful sauce.  2. Radner noodles - this was our first time trying it, and it was very nice.  It's noodles that are deep fried to a point that they are almost like the shaved onions that you get on a steak.  You then pour the sauce with veggies and meat onto the noodles to rehydrate them.  Sounds complicated but they are very tasty.  3. Pad Thai - no explanation, just good  4. Mango Sticky rice - best we've had!"}
{"text":"First of all I have to say that I am a huge fan of Thai food.  That being said, this place definitely hits the mark on all major points, cleanliness, speed of service, food quality and flavor, friendliness, atmosphere, etc.  I have been here several times and am amazed at how much better they are than some of the really good Thai food places in the city.  I usually go with 2-3 other people and none of us has had a bad experience.  Definitely would recommend to anyone visiting the West End."}
{"text":"My weekly thai fix, I've been happy with every entre I've tried.  I have to say the red curry is inconsistent, somedays it is spicy wonderfulness, and some times less so, different cook perhaps."}
{"text":"Food was good and inexpensive. Started with the Summer rolls and Spring rolls, both of which were average. Summer rolls were made with chicken which was interesting.   Four of us shared four dishes:   Pad Thai Hor Khai (wrapped in egg) - This was tasty and I liked the egg. Seafood was a mixture of shrimp, cooked mussels, octopus, etc.   Panang (Peanut) Curry Chicken - Delicious.  Soya Rice Noodle (Pad See-Ew) - I'm normally a huge fan of Pad See- Ew but the noodles were overcooked and not a whole ton of flavour. A decent dish overall but probably wouldn't order again.  Thai Basil Beef - A nice hint of spice and good flavour. Way more veggies than beef.  With the four dishes, two bowls of rice, and two appetizers, our bill with tax came to about $18 each which I think is pretty reasonable. Service was excellent and they didn't bother us after we finished eating and were still chatting which was appreciated! Overall, a good find and will likely be back if I'm ever in the area!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Cashews in Mango sauce with Shrimp and thought it was very yummy!  I wish there was more cashews (I love cashews) and the saw was slightly less sweet.  Overall, I enjoyed it.   We also ordered the pad thai and my boyfriend was not a fan of it at all.  If you want pad thai, go to Sukho Thai.  I promise it will be amazing. We also ordered another thai basil noodle dish (I forget the name).  It's also known as drunken noodles.  I thought it was decent.  I've had better.  But, definitely decent.  Next time, I would try something else."}
{"text":"Finally some real tasty Thai food. Try the curries or anything spicy( it's not really that hot) and cool your mouth with a Thai Ice tea. Great value and tasty."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here with anything you order.  The food is so good order the mango salad so fresh and amazing flavour and colour presentation.  The peanut curry is also rich in flavour and taste.  The staff is friendly and you always have a full glass of cold water."}
{"text":"Hit and miss!  The first time I went here it was delicious, affordable, and authentic tasting (included a pad thai).  The second time, soggy and badly made.  For Thai in a pinch though, worth a visit."}
{"text":"Brutal. Never coming back here. Took forever. Hire more people if you cant handle the volume. Food is average at best."}
{"text":"Our first time at Bua thai - We ordered pad thai, won ton soup and green curry with rice.  Everything was delicious, tasted authentic.  Service and ambiance are great too.  Will def come back again."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food by Thai people.  I suggest expanding your tastebud horizons passed pad Thai as that is my least favourite dish here"}
