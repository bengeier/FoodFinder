{"text":"I love the Tecate Quesadilla chicken or beef it's the best I've ever had, a bit pricey but worth it (it comes with alot of sour cream and guac so if you aren't a big fan get it on the side)"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos and burritos!!!! Try them and you will fall in love with this place."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall, with great food prepared
