{"text":"We went on a Monday at 5 when they opened and were seated immediately. Our server Vincent was great as was our Hibachi Chef Kevin. The sushi we ordered was okay but not on par with Otani in Hudson or House of Hunan in Fairlawn. The Hibachi was delicious and on par with Wasabi in Montrose. Overall it was good and I'd probably go back but just for the hibachi."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic!!! Very busy bit still very attentive service!!! Could definitely use a \"face lift\" but is a old restaurant.  The parking isn't the most convenient but that is the case for all the restaurants on the river front.  Just a bit dirty, however it was busy!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Hibachi Japan many times!  The food is very good and the atmosphere is nice, but they serve no white sauce or yum-yum sauce with their shrimp and that's a must-have for me."}
{"text":"1 hour wait despite having a reservation. Concur with previous reviewers about waiting 15 minutes just to get a waiter to come by to get drink orders and another 15 minutes to bring the drinks out. Haven't even gotten the food yet, but felt compelled to write this review."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and both times the food was good and the service wasn't bad either. The chef both times we went kind of sucked, not really fun. I think Hibachi Japan is better than Wasabi. Haven't tried ShoGun yet but will soon."}
{"text":"Everyone I know loves it here! I've been going here forever! Tried the new location and the server and the chef were incredibly nice and thoughtful! Both went above and beyond! Food was on point! So delicious!!"}
{"text":"The first thing that I noticed when visiting was the odd layout. I feel like the building must have been intended for something else, because the entire restaurant is in a z shape. I agree with other reviewers that the place was grimy.The service was pleasant and attentive, but when one of my friends ordered a beer she had to ask for a glass instead of being given one. Our chef was kind of bland, but the tricks were amusing. One of my other friends who didn't order an entree still got the soup and salad that comes with meals so that was nice. I got the sushi rolls, which were prepared well and presented nicely.  All in all it was a decent experience."}
{"text":"An awesome Hibachi restaurant. Great chefs who are very entertaining. Food is amazing and drinks are pretty delish as well. Reasonable in terms of price- esp. for two people with sushi and 2 drinks apiece along with dinner. Wish that you could get hibachi dinner without having to go through the whole shebang every time."}
{"text":"Hibachi Japan is a Fam Fave. We have been going there since the dawn of time. No disrespect to those who prefer to dine at the Hibachi tables, but I'm in it for the sushi. Hibachi Japan has the best sushi in the region. Everything is pretty basic. It may not be the flashiest sushi dining experience, but the preparation is quality. Do yourself a favor, order the sweet shrimp and get the heads fried. Also order the Yellow Tail with jalapenos slices. Lastly, get a salmon skin hand-roll. I recommend that you order one Salmon Roe, break apart the roll and use the eggs as an additional condiment."}
{"text":"What a DUMPSTER!!!! Want some dirty dining? This is the place to go! This is the first time I'm writing a review, I hope you get a sense of how bad this place is. We got seated pretty fast but left even faster!  First of all had to wipe my own table, it was sticky and dirty and had rice leftovers all over. The plates and glasses were absolutely disgustingly dirty. My glass besides the fingerprints and grease had a piece of food in it!!! I asked for another glass and the waitress took the glass to the back and brought back the same one! She just wiped it and moved the little piece of food a little lower in the glass!!!  This place does not know what sanitary standards are!!!!"}
{"text":"Not worth price. We spent 50 for two. No lo mein noodles. Barely any vegetables. Little sauce. And very little entertainment. Loud noise and a volcano w maybe two jokes!! The group seated after us were served first and the waitress was hardly around. If u serve tea w small cups either make sure service is to standards or leave a pot, which they do not. Then took server 20 min to return w cc!! Not stoked to return soon!"}
{"text":"The entree was pretty good.. filet was cooked perfect.. the chicken was a little over cooked.. and the sushi was just \"ok.\" The \"experience\" wasn't quite as fun as Wasabi- the chefs there are a little more entertaining. I will come back again, but am hoping next time it's a little more fun."}
{"text":"The servers and cooks were friendly and efficient but the food was disappointing. I ordered shrimp and scallops and for $26 thought they should be good. They were tough and the taste was unremarkable. The rice was a bit crunchy too. I wished they served sorbet instead of sherbet since I'm lactose intolerant. Had to skip it. Btw, everything was cooked in what looked like butter. I asked for the Hibachi Martini and the waiter came back and said they were out of one of the ingredients and couldn't make it. Ended up getting tea. They only hav green tea. Wish they had jasmine tea."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and plentiful,  but the service was pretty slow.  We were seated quickly with the call ahead seating,  but the waitress was slow to take drink orders,  slow to bring drinks,  slow to bring soup and salad, slow to clear dishes.  She was nice enough, but other tables started after us were done much quicker than us.  We were there nearly two hours and we only waited 5 minutes for a table.  The chef seemed new,  but he was quite personable and accommodating."}
{"text":"Decent food - HORRIBLE service!!! I rarely write reviews, but after my horrendous experience, I feel the need to warn my fellow yelpers: do not go here!!!"}
{"text":"Hibachi was always known for a fun dinner time with family or friends and for any types of celebration. I had went there for a graduation party with my family and I ordered the lobster and scallop dish which is number 33 on the menu. The lobster was very bland and I had to ask for more butter. The cook was not as entertaining as any other cook at wasabi, their known competitor, and last but not least I had asked for a refill of WATER and had never received one."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice when entering this place, is the strong meat smell that pervades the environment. This is the major drawback.  After that, a really kind waiter will be asking for what you want to eat and accompanying you to the table. From there, the menu is right in front of you. You can choose from a wide variety of meat and other dishes that will be cooked in a hot steel plate right in front of you (literally!). It's an awesome look. You'll have a Japanese cook cooking the meal you ordered and getting the meat to the medium-rare point you like the best.  But, that's a drawback to this. Before you'll get to the meat part, you eat a lot of rice and vegetables that will fill you up and that will carry on the taste of the meat previously cooked on that surface. Eventually, after a few nice-to-look-at tricks performed by the cook, you'll get to the main part of what you ordered, being it meat or fish. Hope you like it, I was already full before eating the first bite of it.   Again, the major drawback is the smell...that will be stuck in your clothes as well."}
{"text":"Food was horrible and extremely over seasoned. All of the walls and vents were covered in a nasty looking film and the ventilation was horrific I had to walk outside just to be able to see. Will never be visiting here again."}
{"text":"I, along with my family, love Habachi. We have been coming to the new and old location for years and have rarely had a bad experience.  We had a small wait only because we were waiting for the rest of our party. However, the upfront staff was wonderful. For Halloween, they had candy sitting out to eat and they were really friendly to my son. The valet staff was also great and also interacted with my son who was all over the place once the sugar kicked in .  We celebrated an aunts birthday. Typically, we get out favorite waiter but he was servicing a table next to ours so we got another very sweet and awesome waitress.  The waitress was great. She was able to take all of our orders and keep up with all our requests. She was friendly and came back and checked on us often.  The soup and salads came out in a timely matter and were both delicious.   Let's talk about the chef, \"Anthony, only in America\". He was fantastic. Had a huge personality and kept us laughing the entire evening. We joked, sampled food and tried to keep the noise to a minimum, not! He was wonderful and made the experience wonderful as they always are.   We ended the evening with the waitress bringing my aunt a cupcake and singing happy birthday to her. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"To even give this 1 star is too much. What a joke this place is. We used to go to the old location down the street and always had great food and service. We were excited they built a bigger new one. We had a party of 6.  First we had a reservation at 8:30pm. We waited 45 minutes before getting to our table. During our wait in the lobby  we decided to go to the bar for a cocktail. 25 Minutes at the bar we waited for a drink. The bartender wouldn't even look at us. He was running around like a chicken with his head cut off. The other bartender was in and out and of the back and she was just as useless. I sat there and watched her take 6 minutes to open up a jar of cherries for the lady sitting next to us. So we wait and finally get our drinks. 2 of them which had fruit flys in them. Then we waited...and waited and waited....another 10 minutes to get the bartenders attention before he got us a fresh one without the flys. We should have left then...oh no but we didn't. After seating, there was no chopstick/silverware on the table, and still crumbs/ crap from the table who sat before us everywhere. . 15 minutes for server, then 10 minutes for ordering. Now it is 10pm. We ordered sushi and only half the order came out. The other half, is still nowhere to be found.....the food is AWFUL. Pre cooked rice, no eggs, tough steaks, overcooked shrimp and no thai noodles. Then the cherry on top of this disaster was 2 bites in I bite into a raw piece of chicken. (which I believe the chef forgot about the chicken orders, because he put them on last, which then he hurried to cook, while we sat there waiting....)  Awsome. We missed our comedy show at 10:30pm. I appreciated the manager trying to make it right by discounting our check and giving us a gift card to come back, you can tell by the look on his face that this was NOT the first complaint he has dealt with. No thanks I will be dining any other Hibatchi but this one. You can have your gift card back, we will pass."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for over 20 years and has seen a decline in quality of food and most recently, a deceptive menu and poor service. A menu item written as \"Cherry Blossom Dinner (for two or more) -$23 per person\" which I assumed  meant it fed two or more people. When I ordered this, the waitress asked \"2 Cherry Blossoms?\", to which I corrected her by saying just 1. When the bill came, it had 2 orders and I was simply told \"the price is $23 when ordering two or more\" and \"this confuses many people\". If so, why hasn't the menu been fixed or an explanation  WHEN I ORDERED 1? This and the food was unacceptable and we be celebrating family birthdays elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Great food! Server was good and so was our chef. I think he was new but he still did pretty good. You get A LOT of food for $18-23 a person. We were stuffed and couldnt even finish our food. Under $60 for a couple with a few beers. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time visiting the new location. They do not have an onsite parking lot. However they have free valet service. Was hard to know this upon pulling up. Made reservations still had to wait almost 20 minutes. Food was disappointing my brother ordered medium rare steak it was too bloody to eat. The bathrooms for some reason have very sticky floors. Also the chef commented that the vents above the hibachi face inward causing the steam to rise in their face."}
{"text":"Best hibachi place around. Get there early unless you want to wait. I'm hooked on the ginger salad dressing. They should bottle it and sell it. Big portions & reasonable prices equal a return visit."}
{"text":"Not a good place for sushi.  2 bad experiences:  1.) Went with a group of friends and ate at sushi bar.  It would have been okay that everything came out at different times, except one member of the group had no food 20 minutes into the meal.  Sushi was decent.  2.) Called for takeout.  Was put on hold, waited 5 minutes before getting disconnected.  Called again, was put on hold for another 5 minutes and was disconnected.  Went to the next Yelp listing for sushi in this area.  Never again."}
{"text":"Decent Asian cuisine of any ethnicity is hard to come by in these parts.  Hibachi Japan is definitely a fun place to go.  The food is really good although not incredibly authentic but close enough if you're craving some good Asian food (I say Asian because it's not authentically Japanese but seems to be a mix of Japanese and Chinese).  The show is fun and the hibachi chefs are all Asian which is a plus.  Portions are huge so it's worth the price tag.  Warning:  No reservations on weekends.  ***Edit (Aug. 27, 2009)  After trying Wasabi I've downgraded Hibachi.  It's not really that Asian (more of an American influenced Asian).  4-stars previously because it was the only place of its kind, but Wasabi has knocked it down to 3."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Fantastic sushi!  Great ambiance, great wait staff.  Absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"If you have reservations for a large party you won't be seated until the entire party arrives. The parking is a pain, but park the car and take a little walk. Parking the car 2 blocks and walking never killed anyone. There's valet parking if you can't bare a little exercise.  The inside is nice and the tables are built for large parties. You won't get much entertainment compared to other Japanese Steak Houses. The pricing is similar so I'm not sure why they tossed the entertainment out the window. I mean where's the flying eggs, silly chefs, and saké being shot into everyone's mouth?   The food was delicious, but the chef made everyone eat their 10 foot mountain of rice as he cooked the meat. It took 10-15 minutes to get the meat and veggies on everyone's plate. Boo I was already stuffed with rice. I'd go back for a birthday party or celebration, but I don't plan on coming back for a night away from my kitchen."}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRIBLE service. Was told it would be 30-35 minutes to get a table and we were finally sat an hour later. Once we were finally seated it took a good 15 minutes for our server to even come get our drink order and the cycle continued. Another 15 minutes to get the drinks then again with the soup and salad. Finally the chef came almost an hour later. Once everyone was completely finished eating it took about 20 minutes (of horrible waiting) to finally get the check and leave. I can understand when a restaurant is busy, but it is absolutely not an excuse for horrible service. The food was great but I will be giving my service to different hibachi restaurants from now on."}
{"text":"The new location is fantastic.  Huge improvement over the old place. Attended the soft open & could only get sushi in the bar.  They're still ironing out some operational kinks getting the new place running - to be expected.  Anxious to return for the full experience.  Big venue, very well done & brand new everything.  Tons of new faces working too.  So happy to see this rebirth!  8/28/2015 went back for dinner on opening night.  The ride was a bit bumpy - slow at times - but resulted in a great meal.  Shawn cooked an amazing dinner.  Yes, there are some kinks to work out with the new location but I have no doubt this place will be a huge hit.  The complimentary valet parking is a great addition."}
{"text":"Having a policy that all members of your party must be present in order to be seated is really ridiculous. We were missing one member of our party and were not permitted to be seated at the table. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if their waiting area seated more than 5 or so people. It was almost impossible to stand waiting for our table. We had reserved two entire tables for a birthday party. This also happened another time, identical situation. When I complained about it the first time, the manager came out and basically said she agreed then let us sit down. There were so many people waiting that when we got to our table, across from us was a crowd of people waiting that had spilled into the actual restaurant.   The employees, or at least the ones I've dealt with are very rude...especially the host. The floors are so greasy because the smoke is not properly being ventilated. I had to take my kids outside while the chef was cooking because they couldn't breath.   Finally, the food is still alright, but used to be much better at the old location. For the price, I would expect a level of consistency, but that's not the case. The food is why I rated them a 2 but the overall experience was not worth the hassle anymore. I've been eating from hibachi Japan for over 10 years and it's sad that it's gone downhill so much."}
{"text":"If you're looking to just do sushi do not come here. Since they've moved to the new location the no longer have a sushi bar. If you want sushi they sit you at some bar tables that aren't wiped down and make the bartenders serve you. We waited 5 min to be greeted and then another ten to see what we wanted for dinner. We ended up getting up and leaving and driving ten minutes down the road to Sushi Katsu. It was 100% better than Hibachi Japan."}
{"text":"Every time I am back in Ohio my whole family gets together and goes here it is an event! This is by far the best Hibachi place I have ever been to, a great value! If you don't believe me just go in and try to get a table without a reservation this place is always packed. I love you Hibachi Japan, I wish you were not so far away!"}
{"text":"Recently went to this place with friends and found it to be utterly disappointing. As a Hibachi lover, perhaps my expectations were far too high. Their hibachi rice was laughable, not a single veggie or egg to be seen. Their 'vegetables' consisted of onions, zucchini and mushrooms. Not a bit of broccoli or a single bean sprout in sight. They meat was overcooked and tough. The salad dressing was the strangest ginger dressing I've ever encountered. And the organization of the team there was poor at best."}
{"text":"Great place for hibachi.  The food is pretty darn good and the show is good too.  Prices are pretty good.  I think Wasabi is probably the best place in Akron but this place comes a close second.  They are cheaper than wasabi."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go to the old location for date night every once in a while. We finally got around to trying the new location and just weren't impressed.  First of all, we've done hibachi countless times and don't really care for the show aspect of it anymore. Other hibachi places have the option of normal dining where they'll cook it for you in the back and bring it out, so we asked about this at the front and the host said sure. He sat us in the bar area and gave us menus. A waiter came soon enough and seemed frazzled, though we went early on a Friday and it was nowhere near busy yet. He said hi then walked away immediately after to grab something to take our order on. He grabbed post it notes...kind of random. We ordered waters and said we'd get sushi but had to peruse the menu first. When he came back, we said we were ready to order sushi and our meals and he said the bar dining area is sushi and drinks only. We said the host said we could eat dinner there so we were confused. He then checked and said okay they can make you hibachi but it'll be about 50 minutes because they have to make it at a table where they do the whole show since there's no stove in the back. What? So we then moved to a table in the dining room and were a little annoyed because now we had to sit through the show. We had also already ordered sushi and now didn't know if it'd be brought out or if we had to reorder.   We reordered sushi and it came, so it's a good thing we did because after we moved seats it's clear that the other waiter canceled our order. The show was fine and typical--onion volcano, flinging shrimp. The food was plenty good so no complaints there, plus this place served pineapple sorbet as dessert and other hibachi places don't always have dessert.   I guess we were just a little annoyed by how our meal began since we made it pretty clear we wanted normal dining and the host made it seem like we could order full menu at the bar seating when clearly we couldn't. We probably would've gone elsewhere had we known because we weren't up for a two hour dinner but that's about how long it took from start to finish."}
{"text":"Four of us walked in on Tuesday 12/27 to have dinner. We had no reservation but I would suggest making one. While we waited for our table we had drinks at the bar (they were all delicious). We got sat in Danielle's section. She was very attentive and we always had everything we needed. Abraham, our chef, was by far the best we've ever had at any hibachi restaurant! The dinners were all excellent and cooked to perfection. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm so sorry to have to leave this review. My family has loved coming to this restaurant for decades, but this new location is nothing like the old one. To echo other reviews here there seems to be a problem with the hood vents and our server had to look away several times to clear his eyes from the smoke. Our server also did a terrible job on the food, our shrimp was so over cooked it was chewy and all of our steak was served at the same time even though we had ordered different temperatures. The worst of all though was the already fried rice, I can't believe they re-cook it in front of you! It tasted like dried out days old Chinese food. If the chefs aren't going to prepare it fresh just serve steamed rice on the side. I don't think we'll ever be back unfortunately. We miss the old place!"}
{"text":"We were in town celebrating a graduation and found this place on Yelp.  We couldn't have been more pleased.  It's a beautiful space.  Our service was great.  The chef was hilarious.  The food was awesome.   I would definitely return if we are in this area again."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Hibachi experience near the Falls. When my wife and I don't have our kids with us, this is where we are. The steak is always tender, whether it's my medium rare or my wife's well done. Shrimp is a must get as well. We've had food made incorrectly once and the chef was quick to fix it (he's cooking it right in front of you, just ask!). My wife is allergic to mushrooms and the wait staff and chefs are more than capable of handling that. Parking is simple, free valet (just pull around the cul de sac)! Valet service is always prompt and friendly as well."}
{"text":"I was only there for sushi but the hibachi tables were full and smelled delicious!  The sushi was good but the menu of choices is small. It also takes quite a bit of time to get the sushi made. I have also been told that on the weekend you can wait over 30 minutes to be seated with a crowd waiting in the very small lobby. This will be a problem in the winter. Who wants to wait in the cold?!!! I will go back to try the hibachi at some point."}
{"text":"Came here for Father's Day, the interior was nice. The food was pretty good, and the chef was nice. Our server acted like it was his very first day. We were a party of 12, and our mouths were dry from very little refills. He came to the table maybe 2-3 times. When it came to splitting the bill, he got the checks wrong, took 20 minutes and still had the checks wrong even with a manager helping him, with a party of 8 or more gratuity was already included. His service was very unprofessional and not skilled because he knew he was getting paid either way."}
{"text":"I don't see why other people have one star. Do you realize how bad conditions must be for that? Food is good. Chefs are good. Service is a little slow but they seem under staffed. Friendly and knowledgeable every time I go there."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try the \"new\" Hibachi Japan location in Cuyahoga Falls for months now.  My husband and I have avoided the old location due to my concerns about cleanliness (sticky floors, bad smell).  I arrived at the new Riverfront location early on a Thursday evening... around 4:25 PM.  I was looking forward to a relaxing meal since hubby was working late.  I was also looking forward to the hibachi sideshow (that I've always loved)!  My first issue was parking.... where in heaven's name does one park to eat at this restaurant?  I drove into the driveway to the right of the restaurant and found myself stuck in a cul-de-sac behind a confused woman who was backing up through said cul-de-sac to park in an area next to the dumpster.  No parking lot is included at this location.  I ended up parking on the street and walking to the restaurant.  Ok... so the restaurant doesn't open until 5.  I literally walked around Cuyahoga Falls for a half-an-hour playing Pokemon Go because I really wanted to eat here.  Got to Level 10!  When the doors to the restaurant were finally unlocked I was seated at a hibachi grill with 7 other diners.  The interior of the restaurant is beautiful and clean!  It is dimly lit and has a nice bar.  The ambience can't make up for the shortfalls though...  WHERE is the fun chef?  Where are the noodles?  Why aren't eggs being flung around by spatulas?  Why isn't the chef catching all manner of food in his hat?  Where is the comedic character that squirts water on the fiery grill?  Why wasn't sake streaming out of a squirt-bottle towards my mouth?  Why did my dinner taste like propane (and is this detrimental to my health)?  Why did 6 diners have to wait for food because one patron \"doesn't like mushrooms... eww!\"  OMG!  Pick them out!!!     My salad (which used to be delicately laced with a thick creamy fresh ginger dressing that clung to the lettuce for dear life) is now slopped with a watery peach-colored sweet ginger broth that I'm convinced will remain on the front of my white cardigan forever.  My filet was NOT rare (as ordered)... like another reviewer mentioned - I kept thinking \"that isn't MY STEAK on the grill... it's too well done!\"  When it was tossed on my plate I was sad.  I would like to interject here that, if the filet mignon was ACTUALLY THICKER than the ribeye or the other (nameless) steak on the hibachi menu, an alert diner (such as myself) could alert the chef to the fact that my filet needed to be pulled off of the propane-enhanced, mushroom-less, shoe-leather-eating-fellow-diner grill before it was pulverized to a temperature beyond medium.  As much as I want to be a cheerleader for the town we live in, I have to admit that Shogun in south Akron is my choice for hibachi from now on."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to eat ever omg I love love love love hibachi oh the soup amazing the salad ummm and the rice ahhhh great and I always get Filet an chicken for sure and the ppl who work here are great super friendly and they have great cooks"}
{"text":"Don't EVER GO HERE!!!!! Worst hibachi place of ALL TIME! The rice was pre cooked. No eggs in there. The rice was plain and tasted like minute rice. Not sticky at all. There was no hibachi noodles like other places! The food was salty and it took forever. ShoGun is way cheaper and better than here as well as Wasabi. This place is well over priced. The seafood smells when it is being cooked. It's smells like it is not fresh at all! They are cheap and trying to make profit by eliminating the eggs and hibachi noodles and cheating people out of their money so they can make a profit. And at the end of the night of our huge party, they try to compensate with free sake. I didn't want sake because I don't drink. Bad manager skills, and not professional at all! Do not go here. You will regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  We had out company Christmas party here.  It was great!"}
{"text":"Love the new location but wished that they had their own parking lot. Food is outstanding & I love all the new additions to the menu. I really wish that they would make their own sauces & salad dressing again & go back to real wash clothes to refresh yourself before dining. Not a fan of the yum yum sauce."}
{"text":"I have been going to Hibachi Japan ever since I was a little girl. My mother used to take my sister and I for lunch when we were kids, and then stayed when they were strictly dinner at the old location, and followed them to their new location.   Last night was probably the worst food, and experience, I've ever had at Hibachi Japan.   Hibachi used to be my absolute FAVORITE restaurant, ever. From the delicious food, to the amazing (and hilarious) chefs, to the great service and beautiful ambiance.. it just couldn't be beat.   Then, they moved to the other side of front street and it's really gone downhill, in all aspects.   Hosts have no idea what they're doing, ever. Super unfriendly and really unaccommodating (like trying to make a member of our party sit in a clearly NOT WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE part of the table, and then getting pissy when you kindly ask if he can just sit at a corner seat or a seat closest to the main aisle).   Service is god awful. Idk if I'm just always getting servers who have never served before, or if they all just like to disappear.. but it's unacceptable to take water orders (restaurant wasn't even busy) and then not return with them for 20-30 minutes. Not an exaggeration. Same goes for refills, if you can even find your server to get one.   Even the Hibachi service has gone way down. Last night our chef undercooked my chicken, ALL the veggies (nothing tastier than raw onion, mushrooms and zucchini), and didn't even season the veggies or meat so everything was extremely bland. When I tried to save the dish with the ginger sauce- I found out it was watered down. Chef was in too much of a hurry to leave so I couldn't complain about my undercooked chicken.   Manager was nowhere to be found.   You pay a pretty good price so you'd expect good food, but I guess I was wrong to even think of such a thing."}
{"text":"Does not even deserve one star. Terrible service awful chef. Went for a birthday and was extremely disappointed. First time and last time. Never recommend and never return"}
{"text":"I dined at Hibachi Japan for the second time recently. The food was delicious & our chef was entertaining. The soup is my favorite and the salad dressing wonderful. My entree was perfect and I even enjoyed the pineapple sherbet. My problem was with the service. We waited forever for our drinks and bill, but when I realized we had a new waiter who was obviously overwhelmed, I was quick to forgive. We also received an apology from the manager and a gift certificate, even though we did not complain. He saw an issue and made it right which is great customer service. What I could not forgive was the way he verbally chastised an employee right in front of all the diners. It was not the place or proper way to handle an issue with an employee. He needs to not show his obvious displeasure with an employee to everyone in the room. I felt bad for the young man & feel that the manager should refrain from that in the future. Unfortunately, that was the main topic of conversation at our table, more than the poor service."}
{"text":"Never again. One of the worst dinning out experiences. The manager was very rude and unpleasant. He yelled at at least four of our party members just for waiting in the waiting room for the rest of the party. He was frustrated how he was going to seat such a large party even though we had reservations and the place was not busy. Drinks were warm and flat. 4/15 people got charged for things that were not ordered, we just paid for it just because we didn't want to have a bad experience.  The only good part of the experience was the chef who was funny, skillful and pleasant."}
{"text":"The food, chef and waitress were all very good. The meal was cooked very well and the atmosphere at the table was very festive. Unfortunately the experience was overshadowed by the negative, condensing and unfriendly front of house staff . We were a party of 12. 11 of us were present and asked to be seated so we could order appetizers and drinks. The career hostess told us that we could not be due to house rules. I asked to speak with the manager. He kept us waiting until the whole party was there. The attitude was that they could not be bothered with stupid customers. The walking by our table with the dirty looks was beyond belief.  Grow up,  realize that your jobs depend on your customers and become professional.   There are hundreds of restaurants we can choose from.  We will not be choosing this one again"}
{"text":"Really I don't give it a star . But had to so I could advance to next review step. So called on a Monday and made reservations for 7:00 on a Saturday. We arrived at 6:30 and let the young lady know we were there but our reservation wasn't till 7 knowing we still had a 1/2 hr wait and we were fine with that. As we waited and passed time away I notice people who arrived well after us being seated when I looked at the time I realized it was 7:30. I walked over and told her I had a reservation for 7 and it's now 7:30. She told me they don't take reservations and that its priority seating. I explained again to her that I called and in fact made a reservation and the person I spoke to check and that time slot was indeed available. I also mention that when I arrived that it wasn't mentioned at all it was priority seating when I mention my 7:00 reservation and was check that I was here. Also I told her that if it was in fact priority seating I was here well before the couple that was just seated. Just looked at me and said  sorry I'm not sure what happened and that a seat should be ready around 8:10. I told her that I had to be somewhere at 8:30 and that keeping me waiting for 2 hrs is totally unacceptable and poor business practices and that they just lost a customer. She looked dead at me and said okay I'll cross your name off as you can tell we have plenty customers."}
{"text":"I think 3 stars is pushing it for me but I think it could go up or down on any given occasion based on tonight's experience. We were seated with a party of 8. One of them had a gluten allergy so his food was made first, then the rest of the table. That's nice, but We weren't with that party and we should've been seated with another group. So, we had our soup and salad and the entire table watched and waited for one person to be cooked for and served. Then, everything was scrubbed to start all over for everyone else's dinner. We were 50 minutes in before they started cooking for the table!  I ordered my filet medium rare and it was well done. As I watched it cook, I kept thinking, \"that can't be the filet...they will bring it out at the very end\". Nope, that was it! The rice was mediocre. We didn't get our sherbet for at least 20 minutes after our plates were cleared because the waitress had to get the cakes the party stored in their refrigerator! Seriously? It was ridiculous. We weren't with this party and we had to wait for them to get served. Plates, forks and a cutting/serving knife were brought for them while we sat with our credit card on the table waiting to blow that Popsicle stand!"}
{"text":"I wish they'll do Hibachi order to go :( The staff here is very friendly, though they seem to be pretty busy whenever I call to place an order.  I've had a couple of the sushi rolls, and I always thought they put way too much rice in the rolls.  I've also had the shrimp fried rice and that was very good, especially with their special garlic sauce!"}
{"text":"A very busy restaurant so call ahead! My boyfriend and I shared a combo entree, a sushi roll, and each had an al carte sushi along with a beer and pop and the bill only came out to $40 and we were more than full. The complementary valet is awesome! Our waiter, Brandon was very nice and took very good care of our table despite them being completely packed. The chef was very funny and entertaining! The entrees come with soup, salad, a ton of fried rice, your meat of choice, vegetables, pineapple sorbet, and green tea so for the atmosphere, service, and entertainment, it's a great deal. Also, for those with allergies, they ask ahead of time if anyone has any allergies they need to be aware of. Also, when tipping please consider the server, chef, and buss boy/girl in your tip. I would highly recommend coming here for a great time! I will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good time with friends this place delivers. The chefs are top notch, service is prompt and the food always de-lish. Went there over the weekend, first time with the boys and they both enjoyed it. The fire scared one a little but he was quickly over his initial fright and enjoyed the food and a show."}
{"text":"A little expensive, but a nice treat and you get a ton of food! Get there early if you don't have reservations. I got there 5 minutes before they opened and there was already a huge line waiting! Got the shrimp and filet and wow was that good!"}
{"text":"Went in January and ordered Sushi and it was amazing. I don't know if they changed chefs or what, but went back yesterday for the sushi again and it was just kind of mediocre--they changed how they do some of their rolls for sure. Tasted fine but ended up with horrid stomach problems for two days which has never happened to me with sushi. Not in any hurry to go back."}
{"text":"I am surprised at the low star rating as this is and always has been one of my favorite restaurants since I was a kid! Food is always prepared well, wonderful and attentive staff, great bartenders and delicious drinks. I used to hate the crowded wait area in the old location but the new one is much more spacious, décor is beautiful and just a wonderful atmosphere from the time you enter to the time you leave. I recommend the Purple Rain long island iced teas and the vegetarian dinner option has never disappointed."}
{"text":"I spent my whole life certain I would hate Hibachi. I grew up in CF, & I was a very, very picky eater during my high school days, when my peers would come here before prom & homecoming. I never joined them because what would I have eaten? No chicken fingers or mozzarella sticks on this menu.  Alas, it's been more than a decade since those days, & a decent amount of travel & culture has convinced me of the glory of Asian food (among other cuisines). I recently tried Hibachi for the first time - FINALLY - & was thrilled to finally silence my skeptical inner 17-year-old.  Hibachi has a weird atmosphere, sort of a used-to-be-fancy feel. It's based in a weird office building on Front Street, somewhere no restaurant ought to be, but it's a massive space with plenty of seating. The decor feels dated & - I hate to say this - almost a little bit grungy, so I wasn't sure I was getting into something legit - but don't be fooled by the slightly '90s feel. THIS FOOD IS BOMB.  I ordered the shrimp entree, which was made in the standard teppanyaki fashion - on a large, open-fire grill with everyone else's food. My aunt & I are both allergic to mushrooms, & the chef was kind enough to make our meals separate from the rest of the group, which meant  we were already done with our food by the time they got theirs, but hey, that's worth not having an allergic reaction. I appreciate their willingness to accommodate dietary issues even at a family-style restaurant.   The chefs here are mostly white, which makes for the standard \"Will this be authentic enough?\" concern, but they're skilled at what they do & good at what they male. They're show-offs by trade, creating onion volcanos & large fires & flipping tiny pieces of shrimp into your mouth as you watch; it's a show, & it's a fun one. I was impressed to discover, though, that it's not all showboating - they also make legitimately delicious food, with fresh ingredients & simple but strong flavors. The fried rice might've been the best I've ever had; they give you a ton, but I could've eaten double that amount.  I also love that they serve four-course meals - a salty scallion soup, a ginger-dressed salad, whichever entree you choose, & a dessert of green tea & pineapple sorbet - plus, of course, a fortune cookie. Folks used to standard CF pricing will find Hibachi expensive or \"fancy,\" but for the quality & amount of food you get, paired with the novelty of a true four-course meal - it's beyond worth it.   Hibachi, I'm sorry I doubted you for so long. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I went with a group of colleagues and we didn't want the whole hibachi table experience. The host hesitated to seat just 3 of 4 of our group. Instead we sat in the bar area. They wouldn't serve anything off the grill at these tables which did not make any sense to me. We had the sushi. It was downright bad. The rice was not good and rolls had way too much sauce. The only redeeming part of the meal was the started salad with ginger dressing (that we had to separately request) and the free sorbet for dessert."}
{"text":"My fiance took me here for our one year anniversary, and it was fabulous.  We called ahead to be put on the list, and the hostess who answered was one of the most polite people I've ever spoken to on the phone, so I was impressed from the first interaction.  We were seated right away, since we had called ahead, which was great.  We ordered a couple of appetizers while waiting for the \"main show\", and all arrived at the proper time and were delicious.  Our main meal was great, and the hibachi chef was one of the best I've seen (I'm a hibachi fan, and try it everywhere).  The quality of the food was great as well.  My fiane got a mojito with his meal and said it was one of the best he's had, so their bar is top-notch as well.  We did have a couple of issues:  1 - the air is oppressively smoky with all the cooking going on - I think they need some work on their exhaust hoods, and 2 - my fiance ordered steak and lobster but it was turned in as shrimp and lobster, but he loved the shrimp and didn't miss the steak too much, so all was well.  All told, I thought Hibachi was fabulous and would definitely recommend it, especially if you get a chance to look in the cute little neighboring shops before or afterwards, or to catch one of their events."}
{"text":"My Daughter loves Hibachi Japan for all her special occasions.  The food is excellent and a good value.  The seating is a bit tight but it is always fun.  The only issue I have is if you get a \"new\" chef.  They are not as entertaining as the seasoned ones.   Over all - We will go back - again and again and again."}
{"text":"Hibachi Japan was one of the first places I was brought to in this area. It's a small restaurant with a small menu - most hibachi places I go have a slightly larger menu - but this one is just straight hibachi. There are some types of sushi and sashimi, but I have never chosen to order any so I cannot critique them. Our family usually just sticks to the hibachi entrees here. The soup is good - but a bit weird and definitely not a typical Japanese style soup as it has crunchy ramen noodles in it instead of just noodles. The broth is good - but I have had better. The salad dressing is pretty good and I always enjoy it. In terms of entrees, I have had the filet, chicken, shrimp, and tofu. The tofu was pretty good - perhaps a bit too covered in soy sauce - but I felt my entire meal had been doused in soy (and I really enjoy soy sauce). The meat quality is always good - but I don't believe it is seasoned as well as other places. But, their filet and chicken are always just good quality so it evens out. The shrimp are pretty normal - good quality, but again, nothing special. Many other hibachi places have better. The fried rice is barely that - there is no egg and it is just rice doused in butter and soy sauce. No seasoning. It's nothing special, and I couldn't each much of mine last time because when added to the soy sauce from the tofu, it was inedible. I enjoy that they bring out the hot green tea - that was a little different. The pineapple sherbert is also pretty good, a nice little treat at the end.  Service is good, obviously like all teppanyaki style grills, they cook the food right there in front of you. Hibachi Japan's show is simple - not as gimmicky or crazy as some I have seen - cute but not too distracting. If you are the type you likes the chef who throws food at you to catch in your mouth, then this isn't the show for you - but I enjoy it as I can keep my conversations going. Our waiters have always been attentive with refills and getting food out on time (like salad, soup, and dessert)."}
{"text":"We had to wait over an hour and we had reservations. Then waited for dinner while seated for 25 minutes.  After dinner it took 15 minutes for desert and checks.  Our reservation was for 7 pm and now we are getting kicked out because our checks took too long to come to the table because they are closing.  We planned a whole night out and now all of the breweries are closed for the night around here."}
{"text":"I made reservations the day prior but it made no difference. The serves were rude and inattentive and had our party standing at the entrance with a cake, pregnant mother and a baby for 40 minutes. When they finally did seat us, it was a other 15 minutes before a waitress even got to our table. The place overall looked dirty with chipping paint on the walls and way too many seats jammed to a single hibachi table. The manager could hardly speak English when I asked what was going on. Overall terrible experience. Do not go here."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. This place was dirty. Windows on doors needed cleaned so did tables. Everything was extra sticky. I haven't received my meal yet but I'm definitely not expecting anything good. There's multiple people standing around that should be cleaning. Definitely won't return."}
{"text":"I've been here and have gotten the most entertaining hibachi chef ever and have gotten the new guy (not funny and no tricks).  The food is good.  Unfortunately, you can't swap out rice for noodles.  This place is usually packed for good reason.  Fortunately, its a huge place, so getting a seat isn't hard."}
{"text":"Hibachi Japan's new location is definitely nicer but amazingly the parking is even worse than the old location. There are about 6 parking spaces on the street and everyone else was parking in random parking lots at businesses and churches across the street. My server told me they have plans of building a dedicated parking lot next to the building so maybe the parking issue will eventually get better. They do have the option for valet parking now though.  I visited today for sushi rather than hibachi. I was a little disappointed and surprised that the new location does not have a sushi bar. The sushi is made back in the kitchen and brought out to their new lounge area with small raised tables near the bar. For me this makes Hibachi Japan no longer a viable option for dining in if I am only getting sushi.  The meal itself is what really disappointed me on this trip though (and this sentiment has been building for awhile now.) I first started visiting Hibachi Japan a couple years ago when I moved to the area. And at first I was overly satisfied with the results of the sushi options I ordered. I always thought they were well above average. But over the last year especially it seems like the selection and quality has decreased dramatically. Today I ordered the sashimi deluxe. I mentioned to my server that yellowtail and mackerel were my favorite fish to eat raw, but it did not even cross my mind that saying that would mean I would get half of my plate filled with yellowtail. My sashimi deluxe only came with 4 variety of fish. To make matters worse though the salmon was inedible. It tasted a little old and had the flavor of the farm-raised salmon you buy for $7.99/lb at the grocery store and had that mushy texture salmon gets when it starts to get old. I ate one piece and left the other four.  The other 3 options were decent. But I really do not think it is acceptable to have a sashimi deluxe meal like this. Seriously, do a Google image search for \"sashimi deluxe\" to see the nice variety and presentation and then look at the picture of my meal. It's just sad.  Unfortunately since there is no sushi bar and the sushi chefs are now shoved way back in the kitchen where they no longer receive tips I can not imagine Hibachi Japan's sushi options can ever improve now as there is no way they will be able to attract a decent sushi chef.  So, \"Meh, I've experienced better\" both here and elsewhere. I may try my luck with hibachi in the future but Hibachi Japan is no longer a place I can recommend anyone get sushi from."}
{"text":"Coming to hibachi for our family has been a tradition for over 15 years.   Now that they've moved to Andre building, it enhances the experience even more. Not only are the servers attentive, but the chefs make a conscious effort to make the experience interesting, to say the least. I highly recommend coming to this location for any special occasion"}
{"text":"Love to get sushi here! Sushi chefs are amazing!! The grill is fun if you have a big group of people they are accommodating but I am most certainly a repeat customer for the sushi!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty filthy to me. Their food is okay but when I leave I smell like a burnt steak. The ventilation is awful and it looks like they never clean their hoods or walls. I've almost busted my ass here too because the floors are so greasy. Wasabi is much less foggy and gross."}
{"text":"Have been here several times! They have now added a sauce like the yum yum sauce and it only adds to the awesomeness of this restaurant. Have never had a bad meal. Sometimes it's a bit of a wait to get in but that is just because it is so good."}
{"text":"I picked my husband up from the airport and headed straight there for our \"Anniversary\" dinner. This was our first time eating at the new location and to be honest I was not impressed. We got seated immediately as we called ahead and made a reservation but after that it appeared the server was stalling. I can't say service was terrible, I can only describe it as being in slow motion. We ordered the \"Cherry Blossom\" dinner for 2 (filet & jumbo shrimp in teriyaki sauce). I have no complaints on the steak & shrimp. The teriyaki sauce gave the shrimp flavor. The few pieces of shrimp we received prior as our \"appetizer\" seemed a tad over cooked with not alot of flavor. The soup was not my favorite and the rice and vegetables also lacked flavor. I definitely prefer Wasabi as this was not what I had expected."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm so surprised at the horrible reviews!! We absolutely love this Hibachi. The new location is awesome and we've never had a problem with getting seated or our service. We always call ahead and let them know the time we will be there. My husband and I have been coming here for fifteen years. It is always great food! Their ginger dressing for the salad is amazing!! Also, delicious mustard sauce and yum yum sauce! Always ask for more!  Always fresh and tasty sushi too.   My husband and I used to live in Akron, but moved a couple of years back towards the Cleveland area. We drive all of the way out to this restaurant because we haven't found another hibachi restaurant that can even compare--you are even able to request your server and chef! So find your favorite and ask. Our favorite chef is \"Ice\". Very tasty food and so entertaining! We highly recommend this restaurant! Love! Love! Love!"}
{"text":"I visited their booth at the Italian Fest and was immediately addicted! We went back last week and had our first dine in experience. The staff was awesome from the hist to the chef. We were treated so well and our server was fantastic! I never needed anything because he was on top of his game! Food was awesome as well! I wish I remembered that servers name! Long blondish Brown hair. Super nice guy! We will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had.  I've hit sushi restaurants all over the US including  a couple in the Hawaiian islands and have yet to find better.  Took a friend who has a Japanese mother and he said he would bring her here with no problem, certain she would love it!  Friendly and attentive staff.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Dirty, incredibly disorganized, and the sushi menu is sad...to say the least. Such a shame from what I valued as a staple in Cuyahoga Falls."}
{"text":"Our group of six couples eat at a new restaurant each month and have been pretty lucky til this terrible location. The service was worse than I've ever seen. We had only one drink as the server disappeared after the first one. The hoods do such a poor job of removing smoke from the grills that the entire building fills with smoke! The manager said he would remove the drinks from the bills. What he actually did was take them off the other couples' and put all drinks on our bill! I had to get out of the smoke, so I just paid it. I couldn't get him to come to the phone the next day to complain and get a refund. I guess I should comment on the food: not great - the quality somehow was better at the previous location. Too expensive for good service - way overpriced for the terrible service they are offering at this location."}
{"text":"I concur with Zack's review. My wife and I were SOOOOOOOO disappointed in the new location. No parking lot, rice was undercooked (manager was nice enough to credit a portion of our bill), and the cook commented on how the exhaust hoods were installed backwards, causing the cooks to have to cook with steam in their face the entire time! (This may be why they had to hire all new cooks) Yes, the old location was run down, but the new location has no character at all. Just a large open room with high ceilings. So many good memories and food at old location. Never had a bad meal, either. We will not be back."}
