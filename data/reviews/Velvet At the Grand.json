{"text":"Wow, I guess you don't dine often.Good food is about the flavours and not about the portion size. If your friend had a 8oz portion of duck and pile of risotto she would be so sick afterwards. This dish is rich and extremely flavourful. Too much of anything isn't good. Hoped you enjoyed A&W as I am sure it was filling."}
{"text":"I can't understand what all the hype is about. This place was surprisingly busy when I went. I admit the food tasted really good! But the portions were embarassing. My friend ordered the duck entree. When the dish came, there were 3 small golf-ball sized pieces of duck. The side risotto that came with the dish taste wonderful but again was served in a small dessert ramekin. My friend could have eaten at least 3 of that entree at $34 a pop...   I can't remember what I ordered.. I remember it tasting good but again portions so small that even I didn't get full. The presentation on all their dishes are lovely... but what they seemed to have miss is people come to eat.. not to look at the food...  Seems like a nice atmosphere just to go for drinks..  My friend and I ended up stopping at A&W after our meal, to have a \"real\" dinner... just like in the commercial...."}
