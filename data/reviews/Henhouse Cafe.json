{"text":"This place is eggcellent (sorry had to do it)    seriously though, check this place out. Great food and good breakfast atmosphere. There are a ton of good choices, and the owner cares and is personally involved."}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant for the first time when I was in Gilbert this morning and I am so glad I did! Although there was a small wait they got us seated in a timely manner. The service and food were fantastic. Our waitress was very attentive and asked how we wanted our checks divided at the beginning of the meal which I always appreciate! The food was so good it made me want to try and recreate the recipe in my own home. I highly recommend this place if you are in Gilbert and want a satisfying breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times.  Usually I avoid it on the weekend due to the extremely long lines but since it was a holiday I had no choice.  When I put my name in I was told it was a 25 minute wait.  65 minutes later we finally got a seat.  I don't necessarily mind waiting but please try to be more accurate than that.  On to the food.  My party ordered the blueberry pancakes, ham I am, and a side of eggs and bacon.  The pancakes were big enough to feed a small army and from what I saw on other tables, they were puny.  Ignoring the ridiculous size, they were quite tasty and filling.  The ham steak was also delicious.  The prices seemed quite reasonable considering the portion size.  The blubbery pancakes were $7.99 and they could easily feed 2-3 people.  If you have time to spare, check this place out."}
{"text":"Horrible! We arrived at 930 and were told it would be a 30 min wait. One hour later, after complaining and suggesting they more tables (that were not being used ) together to seat us we finally received a table.  We then say at the table for another hour waiting for our food. It took 20 mins to receive the water we ordered, after reminding the waitress several times. When we finally received out drinks we were told it would be awhile before we received our food. We had to constantly remind the waitress to refill our drinks. We were finally served our food at 1130. Not worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Came here this morning for the first time and I was very impressed!! It was very busy, we were told it would be about a 20 minute wait for 2 of us. We were kind of hesitant because we couldn't wait long but the hostess offered us a spot at the bar where there were 2 seats. Awesome!!! We got the chorizo breakfast burrito and the strawberry cheesecake French toast. The chorizo burrito was by far the best I've ever had!!!! I will definitely be coming back for that. The French toast was delicious as well! Great food and service. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was fantastic biscuits and gravy they have real red potato hash browns really good. will return again"}
{"text":"I have never felt compelled to actually take the time out of my day to write a review especially someone who works in the service industry, but I had to on this occasion. Never been here and decided to try it out cute inside and very open. Now when the hostess went to seat us she brought us to a half booth half table setting with a gentleman sitting on the booth side very close to our table. I asked the hostess if we could move to a different table so I wasn't sitting on top of this guy. She informs me it's the owner so not to worry he wouldn't be staying he was just visiting with tables. Ok great. Yeah not the case at all for someone who owns a restaurant he is very confused on what is appropriate to discuss in front of other guest or when to stop talking. He talked loudly the entire time about nonsense it was far beyond distracting. Yes granted he may have known these people he was talking too, but I nor my boyfriend really wanted to enjoy breakfast while he explained that his friend had stopped a domestic dispute and another friend who was going to jail. He talked the entire time we were there loudly and the topics were very inappropriate. The waiter was extremely nice and the food was great. But the owner sitting there talking about these topics and for that matter talking the entire time was so rude and distracting. We will be back there as long as he isn't making his rounds talking loudly about everything."}
{"text":"We have been coming to the Henhouse Cafe since the beginning of the year and haven't been disappointed once.  The food is fresh, amazing, and authentic.  The staff and owners have always been friendly, courteous, and genuine.  We're excited to try the new cafe that just opened up on Pecos as our favorite waitress at the other location, we were told she'll be co-owning.  I would try to list my favorite dish, but all of the dishes I've tried have been awesome."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying the food here is yummy, and the owner seems great. I have spoken with him before and he seems like a good dude!  I wanted to share my experience with him today but wasn't able to. So I'm sharing it here with the hopes he will see it. So 2 things really made me mad today. I love good food and support local business, but I hate feeling like I'm getting cheated. I paid $5.99 for a kids meal (grilled cheese, a side and a drink).  For the most part a reasonable price, however I can name many places where kids eat free or under $5 and serve a ton of food. This $6 grilled cheese meal only came with HALF of a grilled cheese!!!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!  For $6 you couldn't put a whole grilled cheese on the plate?!?!  Then we ordered a side of super yummy fries. It literally looked like a plate of someone's left over fries. It wasn't even enough fries to share with my 3 small children. I don't mind paying for good food, but I do mind getting cheated. Please pay attention to your portions and fix your kids meals, otherwise we sadly won't be back."}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable breakfast here a few weeks ago. Can't remeber what I had exactly... the only thing that that comes to mind is the BOMB pancake... probably because it was bigger than my face."}
{"text":"Delicious food. GENEROUS portion. Kind staff. Surprisingly comfortable. Pancakes are good, not great. Biscuits and gravy good, not great. Gravy needs some more flavor. Biscuit was good though.   Overall, a good experience. Not great. Not bad either."}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered the chorizo omelette and it was super tasty! Service was great even with a full restaurant, I think my server was Shelly. She was great! Everyone seemed to work together and I never had to wait on coffee or water refills. Great staff. Great food. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"My first visit here and the service was awesome!  But not as awesome as the food.  I had the Carnita breakfast burrito.  WOW!  Was well worth the 20 minute wait."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Gilbert! The servers are super nice and the food is great. Watch out for the pancakes... the big one can feed like 5 people or a few extremely hungry people... it's HUGE"}
{"text":"First time eating here today, we will definitely be back! The staff was so friendly and the owner even checked on us. The potion sizes were huge we could definitely have split a meal. I'm glad we found this hidden gem in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Chicken and waffles is a must. The coffee is amazing. Our server was polite smiley and very attentive. They were very busy so the food took a little while but it was worth it for a truly home cooked breakfast! The pancakes are HUGE! I mean HUGE!"}
{"text":"Had chicken and waffle the first time here. It was so-so. But the second time we went here the waffle tasted really SOUR. The waitress gave us another waffle but it still tasted SOUR. Tell me, how can a waffle taste sour?! The waitress didn't believed us, she said we probably have \"Taste Bud-itis\" @_@"}
{"text":"First time visiting for breakfast and we really enjoyed this new cafe! Great home style food, friendly staff, & clean environment. The portions of food are pretty large- definitely couldn't finish it all. Our family enjoyed Henhouse Cafe and we Plan to return again!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. I got the breakfast burrito and loved it! Very big breakfast menu. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here last sunday and was hoping to find all the great reviews accurate but the food was just unimpressive and flavorless. We had the french toast, Belgian waffle and a breakfast burrito. The french toast was strangely flavored with a orange liqueur taste. The burrito had absolutely no flavor, very bland.  Their southwest sauce was disgusting, it looks like they mix salsa and sour cream that end ups curdled. I tried the green chile sauce and it was just weird not a true Mexican or New Mexican flavor to it. Not for us unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast.  Lots of people and long wait but very good.  Good options on the menu and the fresh oj was tasty.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We came in today hoping to enjoy brunch before a movie. Well that didn't happen, while sitting for 40+ mins and still not getting our food we finally had to leave or miss our next appointment. Really 40+ mins to get short order cooking that's at best ok. This was our second try and out last. Both visits we had long waits, this is a breakfast and lunch only and they still can't get it together."}
{"text":"Delicious for breakfast! I had the Country Benedict which had sausage gravy that was so good! My friend ordered the strawberry cheesecake French toast which was also incredible! The only thing I didn't love was a side of bacon I ordered. Honestly, I didn't need it. My portion was so large and filling, but it did not have good flavor. It may have just picked up too many flavors from the grill. Also, it was $2.50 for two small pieces of bacon. Seemed high. Our service was quick and friendly. We would definitely go back again. The menu offers a lot of choices I would like to try."}
{"text":"The family and I have been coming to this place for a while now, I always get the same thing, strawberry cheesecake french toast and whatever omelet I'm feeling that morning. The wife always wants to try something new but doesn't always work in her favor. We came in on a weekday, and was hoping to beat their morning rush, we usually see driving by.  We both came in and they were decently busy but no line, we were excited, but no host was in sight. We stood at the door for a few minutes til we were finally greeted and were seated, menus were given to us and the host just left, nothing was said and barely any eye contact was made. That was weird. The wifey and I sat there staring at each other for a good 5 minutes before we asked a server if we could put our order in, and she told us he'd be over in a few minutes. Finally we were greeted by our server, and were basically rushed to put in our order and when I asked if I could get extra filling for my strawberry cheesecake french toast he acted like he didn't hear my request and walked off.  By the time our food came, and our server never checked on us, we were over, the whole experience. We paid and left. Food was still delicious, but service has definitely gone down the drain. Not too sure if we'll be coming here as often anymore, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was delicious. Our table ordered a variety of plates and everybody loved it!"}
{"text":"To start I just want to say we've been to Henhouse many, many times and we absolutely LOVE the food and ambience. The potatoes are amazing and my kiddos love the kids meals- the kids pancake is HUGE (which my boys love). The wait to sit down and receive food can be long sometimes but we've never minded it because the servers are friendly and our food is good.  Today, unfortunately, our server (Olivia) was awful. She took our food order and drink order all at once and never came back- a different server even delivered our food. We waited our entire meal for a coffee refill, syrup for our kiddos' pancake, and a milk refill and she was highly annoyed at me for asking for refills. She never once checked on us or asked how our food was. When I mentioned she hadn't let us know there was a refill charge for milk (we were leaving the restaurant and wouldn't have gotten it if we knew, but my son sat his entire meal without a drink), she ROLLED HER EYES AT ME and then had a different server bring our bill back. Even my 8 year old son noticed and commented on how it's rude to roll your eyes at people. I was highly disappointed in our service today and although we'll be back because we love the place, we'll definitely request not to be sat in Olivia's section."}
{"text":"I was so excited for a local breakfast restaurant but have not been too impressed. I have visited on 3 different occasions with ordinary food, fair service, & lacking decor. I think I was just expecting too much for the Gilbert area. I did not have a terrible experience, just unimpressionable."}
{"text":"Went here one time with my family and when I was told that making egg whites would confuse the kitchen staff... I should have known not to continue. If you want a good breakfast do your self a favor and go to biscuits"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great. The wait staff is very friendly. The food is delicious. The portion sizes are great. Even my daughter enjoys the restaurant. The kids size pancake is like a medium size pizza. There truly is it was homemade and it is delicious. I would recommend this to anyone who likes breakfast or Benedict's or just a good atmosphere for family breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast several times. Every time the food has been delicious. Well cooked food, generous portions and I do mean generous, great wait staff and a breakfast bar. Very family-friendly, my daughter loves this place. We will be going back often."}
{"text":"I was feeling like a child, so I had the coconut cream pie French toast, and it was fantastic. She had the seafood omelet with avocado. It was good, but the avocado was definitely not ripe. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive, but the water tasted like it was ladled from a public pool. Overall, a pleasant experience. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here today and won't be the last! Quality food at excellent food, service and ambiance."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times.  Food is consistently good.  Service is decent.   The format of the weekly specials could be improved to a more durable paper.  Seen the owner in there on a regular basis which is great.  The decor is simple but acceptable for a family owned breakfast restaurant.   For a good breakfast it's a good choice."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  Highly recommend.   They do get pretty busy, so if you aren't patient this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Perfect Sunday brunch place- amazing food, lots of character, outdoor seating and great service! You gotta try this place! We had the pastrami had skillet and the grandpas skillet. They were delicious and the fresh squeezed OJ was great!"}
{"text":"This place is the place to be for breakfast! The only reason I won't give them 5 stars is because the wait for the food was a bit excessive but seriously worth it! Got huevos Rancheros...Latin kick...sooo bomb! Even picked at my friends scraps like the bum I am, but those were delicious bites of French toast. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Everything is amazing!  Big pancakes, potatoes are extra fried and really good... Chicken fried steak is really good too.  The staff are really nice, accommodating, and helpful.  Great for kids and out of town guests.  The line to get a seat can be really heavy, but helps validate why this place is sooo good.  Love this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went Sunday Feb 21. We had been excited to try it since not very good breakfast places around the area. The young lady seating us wanted to seat us at a table but my husband has back issues and asked for a booth (which was empty) she sat us at the booth but wasn't very happy about it. It took awhile before anyone came to get our drink orders. She was not very friendly at ALL. She didn't introduce herself, didn't say good morning. Just what can I get you to drink. When she came back to get our orders I asked what the orange hen next to some of the items ment and she just said they are popular items and acted like I was bothering her asking a question. When our food came the bacon was barely cooked, the potatoes mushy and not any flavor and not much flavor to the gravy. No one ever refilled our drinks or asked how food was. Once we were done it took awhile to get the check. $22. for two for breakfast and not a very good one at that. We may go back to try something else but it will be awhile. They really need to work on service and cooking food all the way."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast or lunch! Almost everything is homemade, their bread is from Capistrano Bakery, and the staff are friendly. We've never had a bad meal there. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast!  Hardest part is deciding what to order because everything is great!  We have ordered the French Toast, Cali Eggs Benedict, Blueberry Lemon Mascarpone Pancakes, and Huevos Rancheros with Carnitas.  Out of all of them, the Huevos Rancheros is incredibly delicious.  Second favorite is the French Toast.  The Eggs Benedict is outstanding also.  The delicate spicing and flavors are the best part of this gem of a restaurant.  Very glad they are opening more locations, although we have never had to wait long for seating or for our food.  The waiter we had this morning was amazing...."}
{"text":"I was craving Eggs Benedict one day so I pulled up trusty Yelp to see what I could find and found Henhouse Cafe! This place was amazing. Best Eggs Benedict I've ever had by far. The restaurant has a really homey feeling and the staff is very attentive and kind."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with my wife after she read reviews of the restaurant. The portions are enormous and the quality is superb. The staff is very warm and the place is excellent. I highly recommend the pancakes, but be warned they will fill you up quickly."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, waited 15 min and finally had to get up and ask for help. The guy who helped us felt bad and did a good job. This place needs a manager who cares, plain and simple. The food was good but the rest needs attention."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast I have ever had.  I ordered the two egg, with has browns, home made sausage and subbed the toast for one pancake (extra $2.50 for this).  They brought out two massive plates of food!!  The hash browns were actually roasted red potatoes that were pan fried.  They were absolutely delicious.  The eggs were scrambled and tasted fine.  The sausage was delicious.  Where else can you get homemade sausage?!  Then the pancake.  This thing is the biggest pancake I have ever seen in my entire life.  Probably a diameter of 14\" or something crazy like that.  It was very good.  They use sweet cream instead of buttermilk, so the pancakes are thick and taste a little different than your normal pancake.  It was still delicious and they also use real maple syrup.  My friend ordered the green chile pork skillet.  That had green chile pork, roasted red potatoes, eggs, cheese and tortilla.  Hers was delicious as well.  The pork was so flavorful and tender.  Service was great, our server was very attentive and helpful when we were looking over the menu.  For those two gave it 1 star, I am not sure what happened, maybe they were new and working out the kinks, but we had nothing but an excellent experience. I will definitely be back.  Best breakfast in the east valley!"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast at the counter yesterday.  The chorizo burrito was amazing and the cinnamon roll is not to be missed.  The servers were attentive and great, even though the restaurant was busy.  We were lucky because there was space at the counter and didn't have to wait for a table. But, it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is a cute Cafe with good coffee. I'm usually picky about my coffee. I got the waffles and it tasted great. We sat outside on the \"patio,\" which is really just a larger sidewalk  with picnic tables placed on it, facing the parking lot, at the front entrance to the store. Not what I would have hoped for for patio seating, but I still enjoyed the option it allowed to sit outside. The seating was fast and the server was attentive."}
{"text":"Located in Mesa Riverview, this is a welcome addition for a delicious breakfast. Tucked into a corner portion of the strip mall, its easy to get to, has adequate parking and plenty of seating. The restaurant is open, so can get a bit loud when its crowded, but it has a welcoming atmosphere and excellent service.   I have been several times and each time the food did not disappoint. The portions are very large, so plan ahead and share or expect a take home box. The pancakes are delicious (and did I mention HUGE?!). I've ordered the Barn Buster breakfast from the Egg Delectable's portion of the menu and had enough meat to add to two additional breakfasts made at home. The Blueberry Lemon Marscapone pancake was delectable! The coffee is also delicious - rich and smooth. My only suggestion would be to add more options for creamer.   I highly recommend giving this new location a try. If you come during the busy weekend brunch hour, bring a dose of patience as you may have to wait - but the quality was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Even when busy, you are always given proper attention and service! Very busy every time I've gone and have been seated in 10 minutes and under. All employees are very kind, courteous, and personable.   As for the food, it's fantastic! Everything is homemade for the most part. Being a family owned restaurant you get quality. I've tried about everything on the menu and you can't really go wrong with whatever you choose to order! I'm partial to omelets, so if you haven't tried them, do it! And the biscuits and gravy are fantastic.   Overall a very great, well organized establishment with awesome food!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast I have ever had.. in any town. Hands down. What a great surprise considering I had no idea what to expect."}
{"text":"I've come here for breakfast several times and have not been disappointed yet!  Staff are friendly and attentive. Come prepared to eat a lot because the servings are hearty and delicious! A clean and comfortable environment."}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST SPOT EVER!!!! These guys are great, the staff is always on point, and the food is out of this world.  We LOVE this place!!"}
{"text":"Waiting for car repair at San Tan Ford, I yelped to find breakfast in the area. After reading reviews I decided to check this place out. As soon as we came in we were greeted warmly by the hostess. She took our drink order and brought our drinks in seconds and we began to peruse the menu. The French toast sounded wonderful, but instead I chose the Two Egg breakfast with bacon. The bacon was cooked just as I like it and the potatoes were delicious (not potato chunks but REAL potatoes!) The wheat toast was thick and chewy which was a pleasant surprise. My son ordered the Southwest Eggs with Chorizo gravy. Even though it wouldn't have been my choice, it had a good flavor and the eggs and potatoes were perfect. I love that this is a local family owned business. It definitely shows by their attention to service and quality of food! The next time I'm in the area I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We liked this place. Service was great on Black Friday morning. Food came in a timely manner and the coffee was decent. Get the potatoes extra crispy. Kids liked the French toast. I got the sausage Benedict and while it was well prepared, didn't care for the sausage patty flavor it was more like simple ground pork party than sausage. Otherwise we would come back."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is great, the prices are good and the service is awesome! Shaheen has been our waiter twice. He knows what we drink and has it at our table almost before we sit, very attentive."}
{"text":"We live close but have never tried this place. We've been missing out. Great food, prices are fair, awesome service. My wife asked the waitress if she was the owner because she had that good of service. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food is great but the service was very slow. Worth the wait if you've got free time but don't expect to eat here in under an hour."}
{"text":"Service was slow, had to wait 30 minutes before I even got creamer for my coffee. Pancakes were not  as good as I expected. If you like cinnamon a lot then they are a good choice, other wise I would suggest getting something else. If you order any speciality pancake don't expect an overload of it. By that I mean I got chocolate chip pancakes and they maybe had like 7 chocolate chips in them. But they do have good bacon!"}
{"text":"Service was good, the server was attentive, very nice and we didn't have to wait.  Food was marginal. The pancakes were ordered off the kid's menu and it was huge, too thick for a kid. My 4 year old didn't like it at all.  The potatoes were bland.  However, the reason I'll never go back is they wouldn't substitute fruit for the bacon. Pretty basic request. The side of bacon costs more than the side of fruit. Doesn't matter, apparently the owner doesn't care about the customers. Had to pay extra to get fruit and still had to pay for the bacon I didn't want. I thought about tipping the server with the bacon I was forced to pay for, but she was very apologetic about their dumb policy, and said her boss would be \"super mad\" if she subbed the food. I got the sense that the owner treats them poorly. Plenty of other places to spend my money, screw this place."}
{"text":"Food is great, if you actually get it.  We've probably been here a dozen times with great service, but then two or three times where the service was so awful, it was unbelievable.  Once, we sat for over a hour with no food, everyone seemed confused and we were finally told that our order was lost and that there were still five orders ahead of us.  Uh no. When you realize you lost an order, don't you then push that baby to the front of the line?  We left.  Hangry."}
{"text":"I was going to rate this restaurant at 10 stars, and everything was going fine until a female manager had to discuss a business concern in public in front of the customer, very, very poor practice.  If you have a concern with an employee, take it behind closed doors. Sadly there may be more to this Henhouse than what we see on the outside.  Take your business behind closed doors.   I thought I was going to come back.   Can't believe it!! Discussion is still out front of everyone.  My profession is Human Resources, and if the same would have occurred at a location of my employment, there would be a serious discussion going on with the manager.   My first impression is this business has very poor employee relation practices.  Do not support this business."}
{"text":"waited over 45 minutes when quoted 20 minutes...when we went to check how much longer and why those who arrived after us were being sat was told they would seat us all they had to do was clean off table.  we waited  about 5 mins longer and left because they offered a table to a party who just arrived...guess they didn't want our buisness.   what a waste of time!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place! This is truly a must if you want good breakfast but also great service. I did not realize they closed early and got their 10 minutes before close: no problem they said. They made sure I took my time and treated us like family.  I also hear they are opening a new location, cant wait.."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it was AMAZING! Everything is priced below $10. My boyfriend and I enjoyed the delicious food! Big portions too!"}
{"text":"Went here to try a new brunch place out, we were happy there was no wait to get a table for two. The waitress came and got our drink orders and we got them and ordered and then, nothing. Our waitress came back about 30 minutes later and apologized the food was taking forever to come out. It was not busy and she did not explain why the food was taking so long. The people sitting next to us were there before us and got their food about 45 minutes after we got there and their order was wrong twice. We got up and left after waiting an hour and we will not be back."}
{"text":"What a great find! Huge portions, great environment, and awesome service. Although it was crowded in the morning, especially during the middle of a work week (we were on vacation), our orders came out in a timely manner. The food was hot, not warm, and our drinks were readily refilled which is a huge thing for our family.  I would suggest if you get Mama's short stack or pancakes (I can't remember what it's called), have at least four to six people in your party. There were four adults in our party and we only ate a quarter of the pancakes provided and took him the rest in pizza size like boxes. Another suggestion, if you order these pancakes, don't order anything else. We got full off of our main meals (which many of us didn't finish anyway) and needed to take practically everything home.  Overall, great find with great prices."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday and didn't really know what to expect.  It was a lot busier than we anticipated for a little breakfast cafe but we were seated in about ten minutes.  The menu is simple, breakfast favorites like omelettes, pancakes and Eggs Benedict.  I had ham and eggs.  The ham was very tasty but they brought me the wrong kind of toast.    My friend ordered biscuits and gravy.  We had a difficult time getting the waiter to understand that she wanted that with eggs AND sausage (one of the options on the menu) and he even brought it out incorrectly after we'd clarified.  The sausage was made in the restaurant, which was nice, but was pretty bland.  I would not order it myself, if we return.  The breakfast potatoes were excellent and not to be missed.  What really impressed me about the place was that it was a full house but they still managed to get our food to the table VERY quickly.  We probably waited longer to be sat then we did for our food to arrive.  The place was also very much a family business, which was nice.  The son was our waiter, the mother came out to check on us when there was the sausage issue, and the father stopped by to make sure we were liking everything."}
{"text":"This place got stellar reviews. I'm unsure as to why. I placed my order and I don't eat bacon so I requested to have fruit in its place. The owner said no. It probably would have cost less to give me the fruit than the bacon.   Anyway, I placed my order and it took 23 minutes to get to me. The place was slow (8:45 on a Wednesday morning).   The food is why I didn't give it less stars. I ordered the California Benedict (without bacon). It was delicious. However, the potatoes were tasteless and so under-seasoned. Plus, some of the potatoes were a bit undercooked.   The waitress was nice, too, but I wasn't offered more to drink. The wait staff stood behind the bar jabbering for the majority of the time I sat there.   Would I go back? Meh....probably not."}
{"text":"Pricey for mediocre food. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Big restaurant went during the week no waiting at all! Ordered the chick and waffle plate delicious!! Hubbs ordered the hash plate. Not the typical corn beef hash looks like shredded meat but VERY good! The service was outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Second visit to this highly popular cafe. If visiting on the weekend,  expect to wait in their quaint & cozy indoor/outdoor area prior. The service was rushed, hardly time to browse the unique menu. House made sausage was referred to as a \"salt lick\" by the sausage eaters at the table. A daring attempt at French toast by making it 'Coconut Cream Style' explains why French toast and coconut cream pie are separate dishes. Eggs were as ordered. Water glasses promptly filled. Coffee was hailed as the best item on the menu. Seating area is jammed pack like a cafeteria so best like close quarters. An average experience lat best leaving us to wonder why all the people.  Clearly some like enough to wait only to be hustled out. Just not us."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite brunch place! Food is always tasty, cooked to order!   Service is not consistent - depends on who is your server, the newer ones (and there seems to be a good amount of turn over here) tend to not be able to keep up with the bustle!   We've tried takeout orders quite a few times - and while the food is good, our order did not seem to be ready by the time we were told it will be ready - we've waited at least 10 mins!   I say - do not accept takeout if the restaurant is too busy... OR  do not say \"it will be ready in 15 mins - when the kitchen really needs 30 mins to catch up!\"   Overall, its still a GO TO place for my family - hand down.  Our faves, Green Chile Skillet and Country Benedict! YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"Strawberry cheesecake French toast was Delicious! I will come back just for that!  The place was busy, but service was pretty good considering. Their pancakes are HUGE! I'm anxious to return and try a few more menu items."}
{"text":"UPDATE 3/2017: I am updating my review from prior. This place had gone completely down hill. It's so disappointing. We came here almost every weekend for the last 2 years. But the last 2 times we have come here the service has been terrible. This morning we arrived before the breakfast rush and somehow once tables started filling up every one else got their food before we did. We waited 45 minutes before we got up and walked out without getting our food. I am embarrassed that I recommended this place to my family. Save your time... Go to McDonald's. At least they deliver."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here this morning. Had the chorizo and egg burrito. It was excellent. Looking forward to trying more menu items. Great atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"Awesome Breakfast and service...green Chili skillet is great! Highly recommend to breakfast foodies."}
{"text":"We waited over 30 minutes to get our food. When it finally came out dishes were mixed up and we had to re-arrange our plates. My sons pancakes were dry and flakey. My husband and I both got omelettes that were just okay. Our potatoes that came with the dish were hardly cooked and they had no flavor. It seriously tasted like they cut the potato, warned it up, then served it to us. The toast that came with our meal was hardly toasted, it was basically a fresh slice of bread. We absolute will not be back."}
{"text":"Breakfast was a bust...mediocre food. Bacon was disgusting. I was hoping for more as Gilbert needs more breakfast places but you are much better off sticking with the Farmhouse downtown or on Gilbert (south of Elliott). They both get really busy with long lines but worth it. Very bummed this Cafe was not good."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place!  The food couldn't be more bland if they tried, the potatoes weren't even cooked. The hostess was a total space cadet. And way too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"The food is great the staff is amazing, and the family is even better. If you haven't been there you need to. Go on the weekend always a packed house and a ton of fun. Mo and Brett have the best attitudes and are a blast to have a conversation with. You can feel the and pride that is pit into the place PERIOD Try the Verde omelet burrito style or veggie omelet burrito style.  Tell them Tyler sent you."}
{"text":"Friendly, oh so friendly!! Has an open dining area with the tables placed very closely together. The hustle of the servers, whizzing past the tables, along with the commotion and clanging of the kitchen provides plenty of noise; a comfortable drone for eating your breakfast.   The plates come loaded!! Presentation is good and the ingredients taste fresh. Huge chunks of potatoes come with orders."}
{"text":"So I came to this place up the street from my house and immediately noticed that you can seat yourself. I'm not sure if this was because it was later in the day but it was nice to not have to wait. My sever came up and immediately took our order. Small irks here, I have a six year old and he can be clumsy, as most six year old are. So I was surprised that she gave him a giant cup with no lid. Also missing a kids mat with kid items.  I can see across my table and see a child about ten with one but not my little guy. That's fine,  ordered him a blueberry pancake. I ordered the southwest biscuits and gravy (they had me at chorizo gravy).  First off his pancake was buttery and slightly nutty and giant. Fresh blueberries sprinkled within the pancake add a nice burst of flavor. I have a good feeling the lemon blueberry pancake would be an even better choice. The warm maple syrup is a nice touch as well.   My southwest biscuits and gravy were not bad. The biscuits while tender were pretty flat. Not enough baking powder I'd imagine. The eggs were perfect and the potatoes were delicious. Flat coins that were crispy while being fluffy in the center. The chorizo gravy had good flavor but had very little actual meat in it. The homemade sausage was a good thought but didn't have as much punch of spices as your store bought variety. The menu has me intrigued enough to come back. Also very good hot sauce collection."}
{"text":"This place is really good and big portions!! Service was phenomenal!! Definitely recommend!!! 5 plus stars!"}
{"text":"Great little hometown place!! Fresh food, fast and friendly service.  Cute little farmhouse decorations. Had a veggie skillet and it was delish!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is unique and tasty. They have the best homemade sausage I've ever had.  The wait staff is friendly and does a good job of making you feel welcomed."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Henhouse Cafe a handful of times. This is only because I live in Queen Creek and it is a bit of a drive. I am not the type of person that usually takes the time to write reviews. However, I like this place so much, I was compelled to share my experience. Every time I have been here the food is great, and the service is friendly. I love that it is family owned and run. The green chili scramble is amazing and the pancakes are to die for. These are the only two things I have eaten here because they are soooo good. I have never eaten lunch, but I am sure it is great too. The serving sizes are large and perfect for sharing. The prices are very reasonable. I really love this place and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Experienced this place for the first time and was sure not at all impressed with the food.  When we got our food, it was like it was just thrown on the plates, my potatoes tasted like they were precooked and sat around for awhile, recooked and no flavor at all.  My husband had an omelet and was lacking the meat and cheese it was suppose to have in it.  For what we paid for the meal, I was expecting much better.  Not so at all.  The coffee was good..that was about all that was good.  Our service  was really good and the waiter very attentive.  Doubt we go back.  The hostess seemed to be more interested in a table with a family she seemed to know and people were having to wait at the front to be seated.  Food overpriced on menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food! My friends and I stopped by this place late morning on a Friday and it was pretty busy. Good sign that the food must be yummy and it was! I had the Ham I Am breakfast which was a generous portion.  We also had a veggie omelet and the California crab omelet,  both were very tasty.  I love the potatoes that were served with the meal; perfectly seasoned! The service was reasonably fast and attentive.  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast meal and service by Shelly. Even talked with the owner (Mo). Also, a great cup of coffee. What a way to start my day with my bride!"}
{"text":"We must have hit this place on a bad day.  Hostess was not friendly.  Basically looked unhappy to be there.  Server started out really attentive then after he took our order never came back to check for coffee refills, which would have been nice when we were waiting for what felt like 30 minutes for our food.  We ordered chicken and waffles with eggs, syrup, and gravy and an order of crunchy French toast.  Chicken was rubbery/burnt & syrup was watery.  French toast was soggy and looked no different then regular french toast (nothing like their little picture on their website).  Not impressed at all.  And when we left a group of people were standing at the counter and not one said \"bye\" or \"thanks for coming in\".  Meh."}
{"text":"Outside seating picnic tables that seat 6 people are ridiculous.  All of them were filled with 2 or 3 people and 20 people waiting to be seated. \"If\" they put smaller tables outside, not so many people would be on the wait list. Just sayin."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. The mascarpone lemon blueberry pancake was great, and I could only eat half of one pancake. The syrup that accompanies it however is disappointing, a watery but maple flavor. But the pancake didn't really need it anyway. Btw the kids pancake is the of the adults.... their homemade sausage had great flavor and texture."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to the Henhouse and was excited because it is close to home. I walked in to multiple open table and let the hostess know there would be two of us and a high chair. She then asked when the rest of my Party would be there and I said shortly.. she then began to seat everyone behind me first. Then another party that wasn't complete got seated before me as well and then I was just frustrated. When I asked about it she got the Manager Beau and it all became very clear as to why she acted the way she did.. he immediately said no she isn't sitting until they are here( like I wasn't standing there) and when I asked why other incomplete party's were being sat his reply was whatever just seat them! During all of this many of the people sitting waiting said they had similar experiences with the manager and were only back because someone in the party wanted to go. The service was fine and the food was breakfast food but the first impression when someone walks in treating the staff and customers that was gives you a very bad taste. There are many breakfast locations that can do what they do and you'll likely not have to deal with Beau."}
{"text":"Service was very slow.  About a 45 min wait after ordering food.  I ordered the veggie skillet with bacon and a lemon blueberry pancake (which was huge).  Food was very tasty once you got it.  We will probably try it again and see if it's any better on the time to get food."}
{"text":"Best chicken fried steak I've found since Bill johnsons closed. The house sausage is a must also. Service is outstanding. I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Great food for a great price, didn't mind the wait but they sat us right next to a major walk way for servers. Once they started to squeeze between our tiny table and the bar is when we started to get upset. We even moved the table a tad bit closer to the bar and they still managed to fit and stand with their rear ends right at our table. Waited about 10 minutes for boxes. Saw the manger and told him that that probably not the best area for servers to walk due to it being extremely close to us. He didn't seem to care just responded with, 'If I designed the place this table wouldn't be here, sorry.\" He didn't seem to care or try to make us feel better about servers rear ends in our faces half of our breakfast. Also overheard a server tell another to just take the money even though he wasn't the server taking care of that table that left $5 on the table. While also the lead server, assuming, yelling who was cut. Couldn't even have a conversation because the area and how loud the servers were, just not a good experience because where we were placed."}
{"text":"I love breakfast places and have been here twice.  Neither time was I impressed.  Service is ok, but stop referring to customers as \"sweetie\" each time you come to the  table.  You are not my Grandma and I am not yours. Eggs benedict is good enough, potatoes are terrible.  How do you mess up potatoes?  Overall a prepared yet bland kind of taste to everything including the toast.   Decor leaves something to be desired although adequate.  Prices are about what would be found in Gilbert anywhere else.   A little more wait time for food and check out at this place but not outrageously so. Not sure there was anything to draw me back and now I know there isn't, especially when there are so many more good places to go.  Goodbye henhouse."}
{"text":"Really cute place, but the food is not good! The biscuits I had and the English muffin that my hubby had both were dry and hard. His poached eggs were very under done and the sausage was bland."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome and the food is great!! It's pretty inexpensive and the food is delicious. I have never had a bad experience and always enjoy the food! The service is great as well! I am a fan of the pancakes for sure. But, if you are feeling extra hungry, get the mama's pancakes!! They are huge. Like the size of a large pizza and you get two of them.   If you love good food and good service, you gotta come check out this place."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast spot around. Chicken and wafflfes was off the hook!!!! Have to get there early or you will hit a line. Hate a line but its a sign of goos food."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Very busy at 10:30am on Jan 1st but waiting for a table was worth it.  Owners Brett and Mo are very friendly and welcoming.  Our server Tanner was a gem.  Very attentive and aimed to please.  There were three of us in our party and we family-styled three different dishes. The green chili scramble, the chorizo biscuits and gravy and a single GINORMOUS pancake.  I could critique every little aspect of these dishes but I won't.  I can only simply say everything was delicious, fresh and mouthwatering! Best pancake I ever had (apparently sweet cream is the key ingredient).  The pulled pork in the scramble melted in your mouth. The chorizo gravy had the right amount of spiciness over the biscuits that ranked right up there with the pancake. Can't wait to come back up from Tucson on another trip just to try something new!"}
{"text":"Went there this past Sunday and let me say I was impressed. Loved the food. Great portion sizes and the pancake's are HUGE! Great little location, I just hope to get there early enough for the cinnamon rolls next time."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Everything we tried on their menu was very delicious. We were from out of town and ate there twice. Neither time disappointed. What a great little restaurant. Loved the Texas bene and chorizo gravy- wow! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Just walked in and was greeted with, \"Welcome, sit where ever  you like\". Well, I would if where we wanted to sit was clean. 5+ (and counting) tables DIRTY with no one tending to them and they were not busy by any means. REALLY!!! Hope the food is worth it.  Ok so..., the food was good and i would return. However, to be great, please use a little seasoning. Maybe next time i can give a better review."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our visit here. Hubby had the chorizo breakfast burrito with a great sauce and I had the grilled Reuben. Fries were a bit salty for my taste. We also ordered a single pancake which was the size of the dinner plate and 1/2 inch thick. Hint of vanilla in it was perfect. Will definitely put on the return to list. Friendly attentive staff"}
{"text":"We've been going here for a couple years now and have always loved it. The food is still amazing, however We went today and noticed a few changes that I'm hoping don't stick. They've pushed the tables closer together giving the feel of it being crowded. Also, maybe it was just today but they normally have a \"specials\" menu with items that change every month or so and today there was none. By \"specials \" I don't mean differently priced items, but unique ones not found on the menu. Oh and sadly they've switched to Pepsi products....PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE go back to Coca-Cola."}
{"text":"Wow! One of the best breakfast places Ive ever been to!! Great customer service and the food was amazing. Chicken and waffles were to die for!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely our favorite breakfast place! The food is FANTASTIC and the service is good like 80%of the time.  Even when the service isn't stellar the food is more than worth it.  Huge delicious pancakes,  some unique scrambles,  cinnamon rolls (if u manage to get them before they're sold out).  I'm an eggs Benedict kind of person and they have a few different kinds,  all of them are so so good.  I've even branched out a few times and gotten lunch and still haven't been disappointed. The kids love it as much as we do. If we ever get the chance to go out for breakfast that's the first place they suggest.  We've been loyal customers since they only had the one location on Guadalupe,  that's where we got hooked.  Lol. Just do yourself a favor and try it."}
{"text":"Well.... I've returned twice since my previous review and both times were pretty terrible. I can't be sure whether my original experience or the last two were flooks. On my second visit, they were \"out\" of many food choices. Forgivable but still pretty strange for a professional restraunt. What wasn't forgivable was both the coffee and food I ordered was cold when it got to the table. When it came back, it was hot, but so burningly so I figured they must use a microwave which explained why my food was tough in the center :/ . Our waitress was still very nice but I, and other members of my party, only got 1 refill of coffee during our entire visit and that was only because we asked. On the third, and most likely final, try their internet was down- cash only. Not a huge deal, and definitely not their fault, but the hostess seemed annoyed when I asked if they take checks and pretty rudely just pointed to the bank across the street. Our experience was bad enough the second time that we agreed not to bother and went to T.C. Egginton's instead- our breakfast there was delicious."}
{"text":"We came in and were told it was a 25 minute wait. We were seated in 5. place was bustling with controlled chaos. We ordered and the food took 25 minutes to arrive.  Staff was friendly and attentive. Portions were large and filling. Would recommend and would return!"}
{"text":"Had the Farm Boy omelette. Very good, certainly above average breakfast, great service."}
{"text":"We were recommended the green chili breakfast plate and it did not disappoint! And to make it even better a side of crispy potatoes were amazing. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"They have a delicious breakfast menu and french toast to die for...the customer service was amazing...family owned and operated which I love!!! Not over priced and worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times because I live so close. Pretty good breakfasts but if it's crowded it's a mess. Staff and management do poorly when they are at capacity."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food with HUGE portions. We went for the first time for a family brunch and ordered the strawberry cheesecake french toast, \"Grandpa skillet,\" and chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy. My mother is a self-proclaimed southern girl having grown up there and adored the fried steak alongside her delicious biscuits and gravy. She was 100% right- the gravy was spot on. Nice and peppery with just a little kick. My sister's french toast was sweet and filling, while my skillet was wonderful (and huge!) as well. We saw several people ordering pancakes... holy cow those things were the size of pizzas!  We were waited on by the general manager, Boe, who was so sweet and attentive. We will definitely be back to try more on the menu. It's so great to have a new breakfast place besides the usual Chompies (good but more expensive with variable service). They also do lunch and have what appears to be an expansive brunchy cocktail and beer selection. Our only complaint? Took 20-30 minutes to finally get our food. But it was busy, our food was fresh when we got it (not sitting around in the window like some places), and our drinks and coffees were never empty. 5/5, hope it stays this good!"}
{"text":"If it weren't for the consistently poor to average (at best) service, they'd get five stars. Food is great but they consistently understaff, which results in poor service. However, if you're not in a hurry, it's great and can't be beat.   My suggestion to the company...increase your staff or watch your top-line shrink. Too many good breakfast places around that know how to serve properly."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, very good food, indoor and outdoor seating, great prices! My husband and I tried this cafe for the first time this morning and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After we had a good experience  the last time, we had family visiting.   So, we decided to take them to Hen House for breakfast.   Glad we  did!  We ordered a kids  chocolate chip pancake,  it was the size of a medium pizzza.  Then came the regular pancake,  size of an extra large pizza.  They were both delicious.  We were sate immediately,  and service was very good."}
{"text":"Just stumbled upon this place and loved it. Our server, Bailey, was wonderful. So wonderful that the couple next to us had followed him from another location. Food was a little slow getting to us, but well worth the wait. Can't wait to go back and try the meatloaf."}
{"text":"We were seated right away which was great--it was seats in the sun but we didn't mind.  What was terrible is that we waited for 20 minutes for kids menus to be printed off. We politely asked for our check because we did order coffee and chocolate milk and the waitress didn't apologize for the wait. The food looked great--unfortunately we never had the opportunity to try it."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food, I come here all the time for breakfast with friends and family and it's always a huge hit"}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets decent ratings is because it is the only non chain breakfast place within 5 miles and the people in the neighborhood (myself included) have no other choice. I've been here three times now over the last year just to be fair, and the service is always slow regardless of weekday or weekend. The food is for the most part processed Sysco packaged distributor junk with no homemade aspects you would expect from a neighborhood breakfast place.  Waffle and pancake batter is just the same as the breakfast buffet in the lobby of a Best Western hotel and the gravy is powdered just add water type. No cream, no effort, no heart.  I was excited on my last visit to see they had a \"chorizo\" gravy but it was the same ole powdered stuff with a heavy hand of paprika. Blah to say the least. Coffee takes a backseat even to Circle K and is not kept in a pot that holds heat so a hot cup comes with a bit of luck. Home fry potatoes are thick mushy chunks that have a little brown to them and no seasoning to speak of. To top it a off, my last visit came with a complementary HAIR in my food courtesy of the under skilled cooks in the kitchen.  All of that for $18.00. Their website makes mention of their son who is active military and I thank him for his service, but as a former Marine myself, I can say that I've had better breakfast in the chow hall on base.  Save a buck. Go to IHOP."}
{"text":"Great food great service good price nuff said! I had the skillet breakfast and left full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots! The food is always fresh and delicious and we are always greeted with a smile! What more can you ask for? Good vibes in a non-franchise setting makes it feel homey and warm.  It does get super busy so try to  beat the rush."}
{"text":"All the praise is well deserved.  Friendly and fast service, great home-cooked food.  It makes traveling away from home that much easier.  Come here...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the second time at the henhouse & both times my food was cold. Service was okay but will never go back."}
{"text":"We will definitely be adding this place to our breakfast rotation! The atmosphere is casual modern farmhouse (note the cool lighting over the bar made from water troughs). We were greeted immediately and given a wait estimate of twenty minutes but were seated within ten. The place is small but it didn't feel like we were crammed together and were able to enjoy private conversation. Micah was our waitress and was outstanding. She was on top of her game and didn't miss a beat. My coffee was continually topped off and she remembered decaf. Definitely the kind of waitress whose section you hope to get seated in again in the future. We didn't order the pancakes, which I guess they are known for, but we watched a family of four enjoy a single pancake entree and ended up taking half of it home in a pizza box!"}
{"text":"Pancakes Re size of manhole covers, portions are very large. pancakes were good. i had morning hash.  nice it wasn't the typical \"caned\" hash, but potatoes were overwhelming in the hash.  Cut down the taters, and ' d give the hash an \"A\".  Price:  for those who say too expensive... I disagree, all but 2 items on menu under $8"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a second chance since the first time I was there was during a holiday and the wait time was expected. I was so wrong!! The food is good but the servers needs some major customer service skills training!! I felt like I was bothering him by asking for some water and maybe silverware since they have none at the table, I specifically said no cheese since I have allergies and my sandwich was covered in it!! Please listen and be courteous to your customers before you have no business!! Ps. Wouldn't hurt to smile either."}
{"text":"Some of the best breakfast I have had in a long time, you can taste the freshness in their food. Not only was the food great but the service was impeccable, they were very busy and the the servers were still very much on top of it, they seated us quickly, food was out on a timely manner and our drinks were never empty! Will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Eggs were over cooked, potatoes were bland, biscuits were dry and seemed like they were two days old.  Eggs Benedict was Sour!  No refills offered on any drinks, had to ask them to Pre-bus the table  Butter was extremely salty!  When we told the waiter that our food \"wasn't as good as expected\" he said \"can I get you something else?\"  I said \"no, it's fine\" (had two small kids with us-didn't have time) he then said \"I hate that word (fine)\" and walked away.  They did discount our bill which is why I even have them 2 stars."}
{"text":"Great to have a good breakfast place in the area, has a quaint upbeat modern country feel, tasteful decor, decent food with generous portions and modest pricing. An overall win for large family breakfasts ( I also noted that that had a private room for large parties), the only thing holding me back from 5 stars was lack of attentiveness from the waitstaff- which having waited tables through college I am a bit critical of, LOL."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! We frequent TC Eggingtons and the quality of food was right up there! I ordered the biscuits and gravy with bacon eggs and potatoes. The bacon was thick, the eggs were cooked to order and I absolutely love homemade potatoes!! My boyfriend had an omelet he said it was good, but the presentation of the plate could have been better. Service was great! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place great service. Id like to give a shoutout to a girl named isabell, amazing worker. Would highly recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Stopped by here twice during Spring Training. Excellent execution of a simple and satisfying business model. Wonderful decor of an otherwise typical location. Quite an extensive list of menu options, hard to choose as everything looks so good. The first visit I had the Diablo scramble. Good balanced flavors with lots of heat. Second visit I went for the Hog Wild Skillet. I have never had chorizo gravy before but OMG, so delicious! We will definitely be back on our next trip!"}
{"text":"Words can't express how delicious the food was here. It was definitely one of the best place to grab breakfast or brunch. I'm a big fan of breakfast and this place exceeded my expectations + some. Service was great. People were friendly. Good was delicious. What else do you need?"}
{"text":"Breakfast here was quite good!  I had the southwest biscuit & gravy plate, with the eggs & extra-crispy bacon.  The gravy was very yummy, but I do wish it had been a bit hotter - I think it took a while to cook my bacon up nice & crisp, and they'd plated the B&G already.  So it was a bit cold, but that didn't stop me from chowing down."}
{"text":"Wake up late and wanting brunch? This is the place if you live in the area. Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! Its a family owned restaurant.  The service and food is absolutely amazing.  I often see the owner, and he greets the tables by name.  Which to me speaks volumes in the way they've had success.  It's very inviting and the staff is very welcoming.  I recently stopped in and had the chicken and waffles, which was a first ever.  I was more than pleased.  I would highly recommend this place to all of my friends."}
{"text":"So disappointing.  Have been a steady regular last 6 months.  Today frozen/cold potatoes on both of our breakfasts, which made me aware that their \"scratch\" fried potatoes are really pre-cooked and \"fried\" on the grill.    To remedy the situation two hot blobs of mushy pre cooked not really fried potatoes totally lacking in taste provided.  Must have had their 'c' team cooking.  Thought the server might do more by comping part of the meal, offering something additional, but she didn't.   Oh well my money spends just fine at the many, many other breakfast joints in the area........"}
{"text":"The portion sizes are huge especially for the kids.  My wife ordered the green chili scramble which was outstanding and worth coming back for.  I ordered the diablo scramble. It was good but after tasting my wife's dish, I wished I ordered her dish instead.  At least I know for next time.  My girls each ordered a chocolate pancake  and eggs off of the kids menu. However the pancake was an adult size pancake which they could of shared.  Overall, food was great and the price was right so we will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! I had french toast that was properly cooked and tasted delicious, while my friends had sausage and potatoes and more. They loved everything they had.  The decor was a little lame, but who cares, the food was great!  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I go to this establishment often. Went in earlier this week, although the food was good, the service wasn't. My server was Sabrina. Rude, took forever to take out order. Didn't come back to check on us or give us refills. Could over hear her talking to other employees in a rude fashion, saying things like \"I decide wether someone gets a free meal and a break. If I feel like they didn't work to earn either, they don't get it. I'm management!\" Is this the kind of people you have working there? Treating employees like this? Is this the kind of staff you want serving your costumers? I have half a mind to call the labor board! If you want to spend your money on a business that runs their business this way, go ahead. I personally don't. One star was generous. She deserves NO STARS. Awful awful person."}
{"text":"Yesterday I witnessed a family who was asked to leave because a 2 year old was fussing. Not family friendly I guess. We left then too and witnessed the owner's parents tell them to \"Go back to their country\". It got so heated that the police were called. I'm no longer supporting such a business."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find this place by my house invited more family 5 plus 1 yr old. Was a 45 min wait totally expected but then another 45 for 4 plates food.  We just thought wow gonna be really good. WRONG so gross pancakes cold thick gross, potatoes had no seasoning cold and omelettes mediocre my 12 year old makes me better ones. Very disappointed! If your thing is Denny's, I Hop, village in the you will like it there."}
{"text":"A little wait for the food to arrive, but really good tasting pancakes, breakfast potatoes, bacon, and orange juice!  Local locations growing, so food and service getting building a reputation!"}
{"text":"Love this place. First time here, service is great atmosphere is great and food is even greater. Very reasonable prices and a lot of food. Will most definitely be coming back. The wait was not bad for a Sunday morning either. We only waited about 15 to 20 minutes. Our waitress Susan was the best."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try this place again after a long absence.  Wanted to swap potatoes for fruit on my breakfast combo.  Was informed of a 1.99 up charge even though the items were only .20 difference on the ala carte choices.  Huge deal?  Not really, but enough of one for us to take our future business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Decent food and decent prices, but service during Sunday mornings was bad. They only checked on us before serving food. Leaving coffee unfilled for 25 minutes.   Patio Area and inside was loud, many people where waiting to be seated and tables remained empty for up to 30 minutes.   Their pancakes are huge, the hash was good but more on the sweet then savory side.   Perhaps the staff was simply overwhelmed, but they did not seem short staffed.   I did see a pancake the size of a pizza, and if that is your thing, it's probably a great place, but if you want a place for Sunday breakfast, I recommend you keep looking."}
{"text":"Glad there's a privately owned restaurant around Higley! Food was good and will go back and try something else. Service was great for us on a busy Sunday morning. Wait was normal 30min but expected. We'll be back!  We ordered ham and eggs, biscuits and gravy, huge pancakes, French toast cheesecake and waffles. They have kids meals too!"}
{"text":"It took me a while to actually eat at the Henhouse but once I finally I did I recommend it to everyone. The California Eggs Benedict is yummy, cinnamon rolls are to die for, the new muffins are incredible. Their cinnamon rolls, muffins, and bread are made locally and picked up daily. The weight sometimes it's a little long but definitely worth it. Locally owned and operated. Very friendly staff, the owners are usually there stepping in if they need to."}
{"text":"We have been here several times, food and service are great. Yesterday was no exception. There was a minor issue that was corrected immediately . Kudos to the manager and our wait staff. Our favorite spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place was really good. We thought there was going to be a long wait on a Sunday morning but it only took about five minutes to get a table. The service was very good and the food was awesome too. Got the carnitas breakfast burrito and it was probably one of the best breakfast burritos I've had in awhile. The portions are huge and the pancakes are even bigger than that. The food did take a bit longer than we like to come out. But when it did it was worth it. I try a new place every week and the wife was happy I picked one that wasn't garbage. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We live very close by and decided to try this place for Sunday breakfast. We were seated in about 5 minutes. The server asked what we would like to drink and I asked for orange juice and my wife wanted coffee. I was told that they were out of orange juice. You'd think that a breakfast rest. would never run out of orange juice. The owner said that their dispenser broke down. Wouldn't you think that he'd send someone to the store to buy a few gallons to appease his customers? The biscuits and gravy was just ok,the potatoes were soggy and greasy.   It took a while to get our food,the server said that they had a private party in the back room. I did notice that customers that were seated after us were eating before us. Our server spent several minutes visiting with a family seated nearby. She clearly wasn't on top of things. When I said it was taking long for the food she check on it. When we were finally served I was told again about the large private party in the back room. The owner stopped by our table to tell me that we hadn't waited that long.  We took the check to the counter to pay,the owner came up took a look at what was left on our plates and gave us a discount on the meal.  We thanked him and left.  Will we go there again? Probably not."}
{"text":"Great place, great service, delicious potatoes, loved the atmosphere. Found a new hang out ."}
{"text":"Super friendly and awesome service staff. Husband and I have been there several times. Every visit has been a positive experience. We haven't had everything on the menu but what we have had was awesome. The last treat was the Strawberry Cheesecake French Toast. Holy! Yum!.  Nice small town atmosphere within the restaurant, kinda nice."}
{"text":"The Henhouse Cafe is to be blunt the best breakfast joint I have eaten at in years. There is a fantastic menu with many classic options but also a mix of things that will pique your curiosity after reading the descriptions. I've seen a few people mention wait times to which I say of course there is a wait! This place is super busy but this place is worth waiting a little extra time for. I'd take waiting for good real food anytime over a quick plate of muck from the common chains that dominate the breakfast market. I got a chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy and it had heart to it. The gravy had flavor the biscuit was grand and the chicken was hand breaded. My grandfather got a pancake that requires a small pizza box to take home leftovers in. His coffee was full the whole time even with it being slammed and the waitress was on top of keeping everyone happy. The Henhouse Cafe is now on my list of places to go out of way to go to and will be spreading the breakfast gospel to go here for sure. So if you find yourself deciding between the The Henhouse Cafe and the First Watch (formerly the Good Egg) you'll want to pick the Henhouse."}
{"text":"BEST breakfast I have EVER had. Sooo good. Got the barnhouse dish. Fresh fresh fresh and very tasty. You will NEVER go back to iHop after eating here. and the prices were comparable.  my friend got the taco salad and it looked amazing. My other friends got the chicken and waffles and they loved it. Go check it out."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! So good, great atmosphere. Food prices are good. The wait on the weekend can be a bit long. 30 minutes or so."}
{"text":"Seriously, how hard is breakfast? Checked and and was told 20-30 minute wait. No probelm, seated in fifteen and then the wheels came off. Waitress took drink orders and brought the coffee but no setups. Kind of hard to stir your coffee without a spoon. Then she took our orders, nothing fancy, 3 breakfast orders. An omelette, a skillet and an eggs Benedict. 30, yes 30, minutes later our food arrived and 2 of the meals were lukewarm at best. Ask to speak to the manager and he was nice enough to take the cost of 1 meal off the bill. Needless to say, I won't be back. We usually go to Crackers and it was a mistake to change it up for this."}
{"text":"I just loved the decor when we walked in, lots of antique style wall art that coincides with the name plus some comical art.  The menu wasn't particularly unique but they serve the traditional just right, at least what we ordered I had a lovely southwestern style Benedict, loved having guacamole on the side, and the chicken and waffle was good. Unfortunately both the chicken and waffle were slightly overcooked and dry Overall a solid breakfast joint with moderate pricing Plus if you're in the mood for a movie the cinema is right around the corner! ...that's what we did ;)"}
{"text":"Not impressed. We waited a very long time for our food (which was perfectly fine but not worth long wait), when I nicely asked the floor manager why 4 tables seated after us had their food and we had not received ours, he told us \"your ticket said 11:05, it has only been 15 minutes...I can show you the ticket\"....I have 12yrs of food & beverage sales and hospitality experience and couldn't believe instead of just apologizing and discounting our drinks or something he tried to prove us wrong. Very bad way to handle a customer complaint. We are sorry we cheated on the Good Egg today, we will be back there next week instead of Henhouse Cafe."}
{"text":"The menu is amazing, it's tough to decide.  Had the southern fried chicken and eggs and a giant pancake with HOMEMADE syrup and everything was incredible.  We will definitely be coming back next time we are in the mood for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Very nice find.   Breakfast was good. Service excellent.   Coffee was very good and refills were quick"}
{"text":"First time here was open Airy with plenty of seating and good Elbow Room.  Very good menu with lots of selection.  Reasonable prices and wait staff was very friendly and able to offer a couple of suggestions which turned out to be excellent.  I had a big breakfast burrito with gravy and was way too much to eat in one setting and it taking some home.  I would definitely get this again.  We will be returning on a regular basis and I would recommend this to others"}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast.if you are not in hurry.  I had Ranchero and it is my favorite. I m not a pancakes person, but my son loves there pan cake. Only problem is there a long wait."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town. We ordered the moms pancake and between 15 of us we still had a 1/4 of it left. I personally ordered the Santa Fe and it was a fantastic omelette. Really moist and lots of flavor. Service was great. The waiter made sure we had everything we needed and keep checking in on us. If you're in the Gilbert area you have to check this place out. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Get one of everything! I have only tried their breakfast but it is awesome. Pancakes as big as pizzas. Great service too. I love supporting local family places. This one is now at the top of my list."}
{"text":"My wife enjoyed the potatoes and spinach in her Popiye omelette. I had the Kitchen Sink omelette. The server was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is relaxed. I imagine that this will be our favorite restaurant to frequent."}
{"text":"My first time at the Hen House and it won't be my last! Rhea was so attentive and personable and gave great recommendations on the menu. Food was great and the place is the cutest!! Had a couple mimosas as well which were made to perfection. Enjoyed my time from the moment I walked in!"}
{"text":"We had a bad first experience at the Henhouse Cafe with little to no interest of making a return trip or recommending it to others.  THE GOOD The food, once we actually got it, was good, but not great.  You can get similar quality at The Village Inn for a better price and without the unacceptable service.  THE BAD We were surprised to be seated within 10 minutes on a Sunday.  Unfortunately, the speed of service stopped there.  After placing our order, many new tables were seated, ordered and received their food.  Despite ordering before the other tables were seated, we were left without food and growing hungry.  Bottom line: 35 minutes after ordering, we received our food.  The shift leader indicated that the kitchen had a 40 minute wait for orders.  When asked how that could be accurate in light of people who were seated after us eating before we even received our food, the shift leader just didn't respond -- great.  Our waiter was fine and I could tell that he knew a mistake had been made.  It was unfortunate that we didn't get (1) an apology or (2) an explanation of why we were served after folks who had been seated after we placed an order.  THE UGLY Then the bill came.  I assumed that the Henhouse Cafe would have offered some level of discounting for the service failure -- nope.  It was offensive to be asked to pay full price for a level of service that was well below any reasonable expectation for a casual restaurant.  We paid, left a tip (not a big one, 10%), and left.  CONCLUSION The Henhouse Cafe is a \"just okay\" food experience with bad service.  For your dollar, you can do much better in the Gilbert/Mesa area and should steer clear of the Henhouse Cafe."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Fantastic green salsa in my skills and chorizo in the Diablo scramble.  My wife is a Mexican food snob and it was beyond her expectations....especially for breakfast.  WARNING:  Now, as for the \"kids pancakes\".....they are ridiculously oversized.  They make for great photos and conversation and laughter but these things can feed four adults...I am not kidding!"}
{"text":"I love the Hen House!!! The food is amazing, I like the protein platter & the French toast is delicious. The owners are so nice & the staff is friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"Food and service here is always wonderful! Even on fathers day the wait was only 20 minutes! The best place for breakfast in town!"}
{"text":"Waited 40 min for food after ordering and food was not so good. Hash browns were raw to the point of being crunchy and very starchy. The country fried steak was not cooked enough with the inside crust mealy and the pastrami hash tasted a bit rancid. Our server was hard to reach at times but friendly when there. The only good things I can say is eggs were cooked  very well and tasted fresh and the owner was out circulating which would have been nice if he had stopped at our table."}
{"text":"Time to try a new breakfast place.  This place is rockin.  It was 3/4 full when we got there and when we left there was a line waiting.  Our waitress was a hoot, and the owner came by to check on us and wanted a true opinion of the food. The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable.  My fave for breakfast is pancakes and theirs did not disappoint.  Light fluffy and yummy.  A short stack is enough for 4 so be careful when you order.  It is open for breakfast and lunch only and next time would like to try lunch.  You gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"First time at the Henhouse Cafe, today.  I tried their corned-beef hash with 3 eggs over medium with a english muffin and a side of avocado.  I was so surprised - it was the very best corned beef hash I have had since I moved to the valley five years ago.  They have a very unique recipe that includes yams in the dish - delicious!  Also, the staff was very prompt and friendly and they were happy to accommodate my dietary requirements.  They give a discount to vets and btw, the coffee is delicious.  I will be back for more!  :o)"}
{"text":"Good local restaurant. Low key and casual environment. There was a small wait of 25-30 min. But weather was nice outside so we didn't mind. It's a small restaurant so I wouldn't recommend a large party. We have a family of 4. The kids pancake was huge!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast place in town! The green chili scramble is awesome!!! My wife like the crunchy french toast. My daughter likes the Cali Benedict.  All the food is fresh and delicious. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom  I had custard pie French toast.  With just the right amount of custard and coconut.  Husband had biscuit & gravy and he said it was great.   The coffee was average as well as the ambience but the staff was excellent."}
{"text":"I like the \"Paul Bunyan\" a lot--it's a huge portion. Can't go wrong with eggs Benedict, either. We went on a weekday and it was packed! Had to sit outside. Luckily, it was nice outside; however, we felt a little neglected by the waiter. No water refills and my husband had to get up to go find someone to get jam for his toast...also, the tables outside are very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Omg I love breakfast food. Especially GOOOOOOD breakfast food!! I usually have their pancakes which are so sweet and delicious but this time I tried their Wild Hog Skillet (I think that's what it was called or maybe I just made it up lol) and LET ME TELL YOU, whatever that creamy, wet sauce on all that meat was, was so amazing  I hate being that person that gets the same thing every time but I think I might just have to be because it was so yummy I could eat it every day! Anyways, give it a try guys. Oh and the lady at the front was so sweet and considerate. Warm and caring customer service is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Was ok, but nothing exceptional.  Potatoes are not that good.  Guess it takes too much effort to learn how to do hash browns.  $2.50 extra for egg whites, don't mind small charge but that's ridiculous.  Don't offer substitution of fruit for potatoes, $2.50 extra for fruit.  Again, not having healthy choices is a turn off.  Service was very slow.  We probably won't be back again."}
{"text":"We were happy to be seated immediately on a busy morning, but it soon became clear that the service was not going to be stellar.  My husband ordered his eggs \"over medium well\" but when his entree arrived, it was obvious that the eggs were extremely runny.  We pointed this out immediately to the server, but her response was that she had ordered them \"over medium well.\"  She never asked if my husband would like the eggs remade or how she could correct the situation, nor were we offered any discount for the incorrectly prepared food.  My veggie skillet was delicious and I loved the plentiful variety of fresh vegetables.  But the server's lack of concern about my husband's runny eggs was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Our breakfast was delicious.  I had the Grandpa's Skillet and really enjoyed the fresh vegetables and the sausage gravy, which I asked for on the side.  It came with a Wolferman English muffin which is way better than the usual thinner brands.  My husband enjoyed the chicken fried chicken, especially since his eggs were prepared exactly as he requested.  We were seated immediately when we arrived at 11:00 a.m. and our server was friendly, prompt, and efficient."}
{"text":"Well, I've been asking my cousin if there's any interesting nfood places around. Since I'm visiting from Socal.. he had nothing for me.  \" Geez \" he said, you guys have it good. Socal has everything. Told him it not about having everything sometimes. I'm just looking for something unique simple and different from the stsndard. You can find it here and everywhere. Anyhow 2am finishing up a movie I opened up Yelp looking at other things I came across a giant pancake! Anyhow that's odd and looks fun lol something to see and try. Well it turns out to be only a few blocks away. We made our way over sometime close to noon. Place wasn't packed but had steady patrons. Anyhow went to order this massive huge pancake just to try and SEE it in personal def a sight to be seen if you can't already tell. Our server was name Sabrina she was very nice and pleasant. We had good conversation intbetween her bringing food out. Warm kind person. I like her and cery pleased with her service and friendly happy attitude. Def had to review this place and her. As I don't place reviews often. So you would think this gianormous pancake would be overwhelming right? Well... it was obviously but it tasted great I couldn't imagine how a huge pancake of this size would but able to cook evenly,  flipped, let alone.. but taste wise it was well balanced and I was pretty satisfied I wished I could have cleared more of the pancake as a challenge to myself I didn't make it even close to half maybe a quarter ish if that. I can't complain with even just eating that much pancake it was great! Such a sight to see as well. What's blew me away as well some of the folks dining there didn't even know this existed! Everyone came by made comments asked questions about it very friend folks there. Well there other great dishes to be had there I'll be back soon for the others and a follow-up review i suppose.   Also I'm sure the others didn't know about this pancake because the other dishes were super good to even think about a giant pancake! Lol it's called \"mom's pancake\" btw.  Shout out and thanks to Sabrina she was excellent server friend with a big bright smile. See you guys next time Sabrina and Henhouse crew thanks again!"}
{"text":"Henhouse is such a fun breakfast spot! I'm a big fan of their biscuits! My kids enjoy the giant Mama's pancakes. My only complaint is the breakfast potatoes.  Atmosphere is very family friendly and servers have always been kind @ the Lindsay location. Be prepared for a wait. This place is ALWAYS packed."}
{"text":"Long wait on food, and a table. Manager exceeded expectations by taking care of a part of the bill. Server was amazing, super sweet and friendly, and the food was killer. Husband got the chicken fried chicken and LOVEDit. We will be back!"}
{"text":"So yummy. Huge portions, good prices, fresh food and friendly service. It's our new breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"The hen house is the place to go if you want an absolute great breakfast. Fresh eggs, hash browns, and veggies. Oh and don't let me forget the best super sized pancakes ever!!!! My husband had the diablo burrito lol that almost put him on fire!!! Lol it was Hilarious watching him eat it... but he made it through sweat and all.   Thanks hen house."}
{"text":"Ok breakfast place. Needs more flavor and more of a selection. I could easily make the menu in my own kitchen which defeats the purpose of going out. The price point is a little high for what you get. Their \"specials\" arent really specials, just highlighted menu items. Our waiter was very abrupt and not very friendly. For a new establishment i can understand a little confusion here and there but hopefully in a few months they will have it under control."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and really cute and popular place.  They seem to be known for their giant pancakes.  We asked for small ones, but they don't do small.  It would be nice if they did silver dollar pancakes for the kids and seniors.  We also had French toast, sausage, eggs, and potatoes.  We split a cinnamon roll between six of us as an appetizer.  All of the food was solid breakfast fare.  The coffee was standard diner coffee.  Love the decor."}
{"text":"Wow!! We had about a 30 minute wait and it was completely worth it!! The Paul Bunyan place was perfect! The sausage patties reminded me of living on the farm outside of Chicago, when our neighbor would bring us fresh, ground pork sausage. Wife had the breakfast burrito and was hungry, but could only eat half. Son had the chicken and waffles and it was really incredible! 5 Stars and worth the saint. Quaintly decorated. We also took 3 of the homemade Cinnamon Rolls home for tomorrow.  Loved it!!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. Easy bike ride off the canal, and they have some amazing Eggs Benedict choices. OH and their crispy French toast is bomb.  The single and ONLY downside is they have the most expensive cup of coffee in town. Yipes!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the the most creative and delicious breakfast food I've tasted. Excellent service."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic!  (With the exception of the chicken and waffles Benedict which was quite dry).  We were a party of 17 so we had a wide array of choices and all were very good. Breakfast potatoes are fabulous. Sausage is wonderful, bacon very tasty, crunchy French toast to die for. Great experience. Jennifer was a doll, very helpful, patient and attentive. She rates a 10 in my book. Great experience and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Hate that they will not serve anything on the menu anytime came in has a group for breakfast/lunch was told nope you can't have a burger you can only have breakfast I am a paying guest I will not be told what I'm going to eat I can't eat eggs and most everything on breakfast has eggs or is made with eggs then was told I can't sub the egg for anything so payed full price for my meal with no eggs and got nothing else will never be back"}
{"text":"Great customer service; mediocre food. I had the huevos rancheros with carnitas. The potatoes were undercooked. The salsa tasted like it was out of a jar. Underwhelmed...."}
{"text":"UPDATE:   Kuddos to the manager of this place! I had an unpleasant experience when I first came, but he was willing to make it right!   I came again today and it was a great experience. Our server John was great, always checking on us. I asked whether I can sub some extra potatoes instead of eggs and meat and that was not the problem. I mentioned that I would like very minimal oil, and that was accommodated also. My food came out hot & fresh - and tasted really good! For the big size of the group I was part of - the service was prompt and on point - from getting drink orders to bringing out the boxes for leftovers ;)  At this point I'm definitely planning to come back and try some of those great looking pancakes I saw some people eat!    ORIGINAL REVIEW:  People at work are raving about this place. Called ahead of time to check on allergens in a specific food item. The girl on the phone said, \" We get our veggies in a bag from Cisco, so we can't guarantee that it doesn't have it\" I asked again whether the bag they came in listed the ingredients to check, but she kept saying that she asked the owner and they can't guarantee\". Perhaps they were playing it safe (which I can admire), but the customer service while on the phone was definitely in need of improvement.  Ok, so we all go there for a team breakfast. I ordered my food. The wait was long (quite long). Again, I understand that the place is busy but it should be customary for a waiter to at least stop by and inform us of the wait. Gosh, bring out a toast on the house or something!  The food came out. I ordered the veggie skillet. The flavor profile was ok but everything was drenched in oil. My toast, my potatoes, and my veggies were super greasy and soggy.Maybe that's what attracts people who like bacon, eggs, and cheese laden things, but people who order something called \"Veggie Skillet\" may not appreciate that. I surely didn't.  Needless to say, tried it, reviewed it... Will go to a Good Egg in the future."}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time! The service was amazing. The staff was so personable Too. I highly recommend checking them out if you haven't been before! New favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I got the BBQ chicken salad and it was awesome thank you hand house good people good food I also had the burger which was good as well see you soon"}
{"text":"The tamale plate is sooooooooo good!!! One of the best breakfast dishes I have ever put in my mouth!! I will definitely be back again to order this same dish! The waitress was super sweet and did a good job!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem  Awesome brunch. Great food at reasonable prices.  Service staff very attentive . Kitchen a bit slow but the food was so goood it was excusable."}
{"text":"I tried the green chili skillet---supposedly their most popular dish and the country fried chicken and it was bland and had no taste. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The food was great, but not super impressed with customer service. They just rolled out pumpkin pancakes and I asked how much one would be as a side. Waitress told me it would be $2.49. When the bill came it turned out it was $3.49 PLUS $2.49--a $6 pancake! If I had known that I certainly wouldn't have added it. She acknowledged the mistake and apologized saying that they had just rolled these out and she didn't know it would be that much, but then said \"Here's your bill\" and avoided the table. I paid the bill, but I definitely would have appreciated them at least honoring the $2.49 they originally said or something--without the pancake my bill would have been $10.50 and instead was $16.75. That's a pretty significant jump. So not a good lasting impression customer service-wise."}
{"text":"Keeping it simple. Wait time to be seated (on weekends): 30-40 mins for us...always...for our family of 4 Time to get serviced: fast (5mins) Time to get food: 30-40mins average Food: delicious  Price: ok Service: ok. Not the best but nothing to complain about.  On a side note: considering that the average wait is 30-40mins to get seated + 30-40mins to get your food, you're spending at about 1.5 hrs just for breakfast, this place still has their loyal customers and my family is one of them. And I wish so badly they just ease off charging extra for a side of condiment (salsa, sour cream etc), especially when they only fill up the container 75%. Its only .50 but still, little things like this is what makes me wish establishments (especially busy ones who have ridiculous wait times) showed a little more appreciation for their customers rather than nickling and diming everything."}
{"text":"First time here and it was so good! I ordered the crunchy french toast and I can't imagine myself coming here and ordering anything else. My friend got the huevos rancheros which was also very tasty. Staff was friendly. Our server, Keegan was funny, nice and attentive. A manager was walking around and asked us how we were doing (always makes me happy). All around great experience. Place was full but we didn't have a wait time. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Top-notch breakfast/brunch! The food is excellent, service is on point and friendly, and everything I've had makes the next dish so much better. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect - there's not a lot of breakfast places on this area and this totally hit the spot for our pre-flight breakfast. It's going to hold me until dinner tonight.   I had the Cali Benedicts; I couldn't eat all of it. The English muffin was huge! My eggs were good, bacon was perfect, avocado was fresh.   My partner had the breakfast burrito and it was enormous.   Father in Law had the biscuits and gravy, he couldn't finish it either.   Coffee was great, service was wonderful. I totally recommend it :)"}
{"text":"It's a nice breakfast/ brunch getaway. I personally don't have too much time to go but I get their HUGE pizza sized pancakes to share when I do."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place!!  A friend took me while I was visiting and I was in shock with how great the food tasted and how fast the service was. The tables are very close to each other so you'll hear the conversation of the person next to you for sure. But the atmosphere is very homey and everyone is very friendly. I would highly recommend this place to anyone near it for breakfast. The chicken fried steak is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Food was ok but they charge for every single change. We asked for fruit instead of potatoes and were charged an extra $5.58. We asked to put cheddar cheese instead of Swiss and were charged additional .99. Our bill for 2 simple breakfasts was $39.55. Way too expensive so most likely will never come back here."}
{"text":"This breakfast place recently opened in a new location near me so I thought I'd try it out. My friend and I were seated immediately when we came in at around 10:30 AM. Our waitress, Kim, promptly took our order and our food and drinks came out shortly after. They have some of the best breakfast food I've ever tried. My Santa Fe omelette came with a side of toast and potatoes. I've never had potatoes like the ones I got here. They are thin slices of potatoes but taste like typical breakfast potatoes, very good! I'd definitely recommend this place to someone looking for a new breakfast joint."}
{"text":"My brunch saga continues! We are trying to branch out and look for new places, so I stumbled upon Henhouse Cafe on Yelp. It was busy on Saturday morning, we were told the wait would be about 25-30 minutes but we were seated much quicker than that. The service was okay during our brunch; our food and check were brought to us timely and our waitress checked in to make sure we had everything we needed.  I ordered the Veggie Fresh Omelet and my husband got the Farm Girl Sandwich. Both plates came with a lot of food. The omelet was pretty standard but the potatoes were good. I only wished that they had more of a crisp to them like hash browns. If I got this again (or any omelet) I would ask for the side of toast without butter. It was way too much! My husband enjoyed his sandwich, it was large & filling.  Overall, an decent choice. I'm not super eager to return soon because the prices were a big high for the quality of the food, however it was alright!"}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday morning.  Seated fairly quickly, but then it took a while to get a waitress to come over.  After that, the service was good.  The food is good, but the pancakes are ridiculously large.  They look like they were made on a pizza pan.  This seems a bit wasteful and should be noted on the menu that they are big enough to feed 4 people. It is nice to have a breakfast place in the area."}
{"text":"For anyone looking for a job at the henhouse cafe: If you are looking for some good old fashion micromanaging, zero personality, and like to be talk down to on a regular basis then this is the place for you! Weekend money is fantastic!... provided you have some seniority but mostly if they like you. In other words cross your fingers for One of the \"Good stations\". Being nervous for your job is also A Perk! It's incredibly common for them to fire people on a whim, without warning, and sometimes with a made up reason. Whether or not you actually even did anything wrong.  On a positive note, it was an eye opening experience! Good Luck!... seriously.."}
{"text":"Out of towers that we are... We  had a very delicious breakfast!! The syrup was out of this world. Three ladies sharing three different items chili Quiles, French toast and lemon blueberry Marscapone. Lots of food with good food.  Thank you thank you we will be back."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place for breakfast in the East Valley.   I LOVE the biscuits and gravy and the french toast. Super duper yummy! You also have to try the chorizo burrito. For a non-mexican food establishment, it's amazing. The sauce on the side makes the burrito.   So here are the downsides which I overlook because the food is so dang good...the owner is a bit on the loud side. There have been a few times when he was chatting it up with tables near my table and he was loud enough to disturb us. Nice guy, just loud and chatty. The wait staff is consistently inconsistent.  Slow service almost every time and not as friendly as I would expect. There have been a couple of times where we had okay to above average service, but mostly below average. Also, not a lot of options for coffee. They should consider adding on some specialty coffee, that would be a big seller and nice for the customer. I would also like to see the wait staff look a bit more presentable. Some of these ladies and gentlemen have some messy/unkempt hair. It takes away from the look of the place. Maybe I'm just getting old and don't get the style they are going for...that's totally possible.   I enjoy the decor and the outside seating option is very nice. Bottom Line: the food is epic but they do have a few minor things they could work on."}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast. The food is always delicious! If anything my only gripe is that of the wait time, but nothing you can do when everyone knows how good of a locally owned place it is! When the line is really bad we just do take out and eat at home. Still supporting local business and getting great food!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! Mitch is a fabulous server!!  This place is a definite must!!! Breakfast and lunch are beyond delicious!"}
{"text":"I liked this place. Came here for Mother's Day and we were seated fairly quickly. I had the BQ chicken salad which was delicious except for the fact it came on spring greens. It weirded me out a little. My mom had French toast which I tried and loved. I'll probably get that if I go again."}
{"text":"Went to Henhouse Cafe to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  The food was very good but the service was very slow.  You would think when there is a 1 year old and a 3 year old the waitress would know that they can't sit still for any length of time. Took forever to get our check and she never even refilled our water glasses.  Would go back for food but would hope for a different waitress"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great service. Just recently added outdoor seating which during this time of year in Arizona is perfect!"}
{"text":"I have been noticeably quiet of late. It seems I have been dining at all good restaurants with good service and have become rather complacent in sharing. But, as we all know, it only takes one bad apple to ruin everything - and this one ruined my good streak.  The Cafe had come recommended and we were considering it for our monthly Meetup group breakfast so the hubs and I did our initial run.  We arrived at 740 on a Sunday morning after church and the place was nicely busy.  We had tried before to go there but the lines have always been too long so we were thrilled to finally be part of the in-crowd LOL  About 1/2 of the tables were taken in the main dining area, the side room empty, the bar about 1/2 full. So not so busy that we sat 10 minutes without any contact or water.  Rule number 1: greet them, get them a cuppa, apologize if you are busy.  Okay. I am going to give them a 2/5 on that.   We ordered simple - a veggie omelet for hubs and a 2 egg over easy breakfast for me. We got our meal 30 minutes - count it - 30 minutes later.  Not sure  - I think they had to go in back to the henhouse and wait for the eggs to be laid.  30 minutes on a not-so-busy morning.  Hubs omelet was fine. Chock full of pepper and onions, mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes.  It was a typical veggie omelet, nothing special.  The potatoes were uneven. They are steamed redskins that are them griddled which is not a bad way to make homefries (I like to boil then griddle but same idea). The thin slices were really good and crispy - my plate was dark and yummy. Hubs, however, had thick slices that did not look griddled at all - they looked like a pasty Pittsburgher transplanted to the Valley of the Sun LOL and they were hard in the middle meaning those guys needed a tad more cooking.   Toast should not be a big deal - but it was drenched in something other than butter.  Liquid gold? Melted margarine? And it is thick Texas break so when I say soaked.....  My eggs, however, were the Waterloo for the day. Sunnyside up is not a tough option for an experienced cook.  I grew up cooking them in a skillet as well as on the grill since busy breakfasts mean multiple orders at once. Anyway, they came back.... not even undercooked.  The area around the yolk - maybe 1\" in all directions - was clear. The eggs were not cooked.  Being the good girl I am, I didn't make a fuss - I asked the server if she would have the cook flip them on the grill and make them over easy - that was fine with me, I just could not eat raw whites.  When she brought it back, her comment was all I need to say \"I'm sorry. He would not flip them over, he tried to cook them more sunnyside up\" which resulted in eggs that were oddly bipolar - the edges were SO overcooked, they were brittle and curled up, the center was slightly more solid but still undone.  As a server, she should have not brought them out. She knew it. There was no use sending them back - one more time on the grill and i could take them home and use them as Frisbees for the pup.  When she came back for refills, she never said a word at the uneaten eggs on my plate.  Finally when she brought back my credit card to sign, she said \"sorry about the eggs\". At that point, I was just ticked. I don't usually complain but I did. I say that the eggs were disgraceful, that the cook would allow them to go out like that and that she as a server should not have brought them out when he wouldn't remedy the situation. she said \"this is a family owned business, I can't tell the cook to do anything, they own this place\". Wow. Just wow. I come from a family-owned business and, as anyone that knows me knows, I try to  onlygo to family-owned non-francise businesses (except for Dairy Queen, but we all have vices....). If anything,those are the places where typically people/owners DO care about their business and their reputation.  So, Henhouse Cafe - which is it? Do you really not care - in which case, shame on you, lots of other good restaurants in the area?  Or do you care, in which case, you ought to reprimand or fire the server?  Either way, I think the breakfast club will not be stopping by anytime soon....."}
{"text":"I really like these restaurants, especially the menu,  which has many items that you can't find anywhere else. But they are Slow, SLOW! We sat for at least 10 minutes before anyone even asked if we wanted drinks...another 5 before we got them...and this wasn't even a weekend....always takes a while to get the food too...I still go cause I like it, but have to be patient!"}
{"text":"Bless the people of Henhouse, the service and breakfast was phenomenal. The strawberry cheesecake stuffed French toast had the perfect amount of sweetness and I liked the cream filling inside. My family got the green Chile skillet on a cast iron and biscuit/gravy so I tried those as well. The spiciness of the green Chile skillet with potatoes is what you would expect for a Mexican style breakfast, it had a tortilla on the side too. The biscuits and gravy were awesome, I could taste the freshness of the dough. But y'all the homemade sausage you must get!! It's far off from frozen patties. The only thing I didn't like were the scrambled eggs which had no taste so I had to add salt and pepper but I'm not phased. This place is great though I definitely would recommend going on the weekday because even though this place is popular they're not that busy!"}
{"text":"The food is worth the wait!! A bit frustrating the time to wait at this location...not sure if they were short staffed but waiting for over half hour when there were clearly places to sit was irritating. With that said, service was nice and food came out relatively quickly; only my first cup of their delicious coffee was gone by the time it came out.   Great selections to choose from and prices are reasonable. Portion sizes are large and those pancakes......wow! HUGE! I had chicken fried steak with gravy but substituted the normal sausage gravy for the chorizo gravy. 100% worth the small up charge. Eggs done exactly as ordered and the english muffin I ordered was larger than normal. If there was a minor criticism with the food, the potato are a bit bland for me but condiments on table fixed that. Definitely coming back asap!"}
{"text":"Warrants another visit. We noticed this new restaurant in Gilbert getting a lot of traffic and decided to try it for breakfast this morning. Nice menu and good service. I just had a western omelet and Susan had the oatmeal. Her coffee was cold because they forgot to turn the heater on for the decaf this morning and she wasn't real thrilled with the steel cut oatmeal. Anyway, my omelet was pretty good. They serve Texas toast sized bread for toast which I can do without. Prices are right up there with high end breakfast joints (Denny's not included here). Overall, a good experience and we will probably give it another try. Staff was very friendly and made up for the cold coffee."}
{"text":"As another person said, this is a great place with nice owners and excellent service.  My wife is not a big eater and thought she'd just order the single pancake.  It was one pancake but it was enormous.  She probably ate one third of it.  I had the eggs benedict.  I'm pretty fussy with this entree and there are few places that make it exactly as I like.  They were good but I had to pick off the onions on top as I didn't know it would be served that way or I'd have asked them not to.  The English muffin could have been toasted more.  From what I saw though, everything else looked great.  We will go back especially because the people there seem so nice."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast menu. Kind and nice people. Great pancakes you should try.. They are huge!!  However"}
{"text":"Yes I agree, the food is good. But, not worth waiting 25 minutes to have our order taken. Simple breakfast and lunch food shouldn't take 40 minutes to prepare! Food is not good enough to want to go back!"}
{"text":"French toast burnt. Service extremely slow! Food just Ok. I'll stay home and cook before I go back!"}
{"text":"Solid food, good service an reasonable  prices!   Was in the area and decided to stop by for brunch.  Came at 1 and there was no wait although i would say they were still steady inside.    Ordered and iced coffee with the French toast and my boyfriend got the \" short stack\" with a side of bacon and their potatoes   The French toast was the best part, i did taste some coconut in it ( not a coconut fan) but still Enjoyed it! The portion was large and in my opinion could have easily been shared. The potatoes were AMAZing Like thing sliced red potatoes season with  rosemary delishness!   The pancake \" short stack\" was HUGE like the size of a personal pizza, in my opinion lacked taste and was an odd texture, wouldn't order it again.    I must say they had a good menu and the prices were good I'd deff return to try some Of the other things on the menu! Also service was awesome, was worried with all the reviews but all the servers had a smile and were attentive to their tables."}
{"text":"Great food! Good coffee! But service not so good. They seem very unorganized of which tables are theirs to serve. Or maybe their sections are too spread out from each other. Pancakes were absolutely perfect though!"}
{"text":"Great biscuits and gravy! Huge portions. Menu has good variety and everyone will be able to find something to order. Restaurant is a little noisy and hard to talk I ."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another chance since it hadn't been open that long during my first visit. Plus, my husband hadn't tried it yet, and he loves biscuits and gravy for breakfast.  The bump up in stars only reflects better service but the food is still subpar. My husband said the biscuits were fluffy and the gravy was fine, but we both disliked the breakfast potatoes. They are underseasoned and undercooked sliced red potatoes. Give us hashbrowns any day! My huevos rancheros wasn't good at all. With my first bite, \"marinara\" popped into my head. Their ranchero sauce tasted much less like anything Mexican and was more like a spaghetti sauce. I couldn't really taste the beans because the potatoes were jammed between the layers of tortillas. At least the eggs were cooked properly.   The food came out very fast which is the mark of a well operated breakfast place. The coffee is still bad, and they still insist on using the non-dairy creamers. We won't be revisting Henhouse."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere for a bfast place. I will return in the near future. A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry Henhouse, didn't have anyone to vent to and through the acts of businesses becoming so unacceptable lately (especially for what we pay) it had to start somewhere, and with over ten years experience in the serving industry, you deserve it after what I experienced Saturday 3.3.18. Why so bad? Because your entire staff avoided me like the plague (after I ordered of course). Kayla was very nice, made sure I had an oj right away and checked twice on me before ordering, and after I did I never saw her again. Unfortunately the skillet (which to my mistake I thought had cheese, but realised my mistake and thought long as my egg is medium it'll get me through) my egg had a spot of liquid and the rest looked so over done it looked scrambled. Mind you, I was at the counter!! EVERY employee looked at me and every employee wanted to get checked out for end of shift duties instead of anyone (server included) ask how my meal was. A server (right in front of me rolling silver ware) who informed me about the cheese, asked if I wanted a side of cold cheese for it? It was at that point I realized I was at a wash, put my card out, ate my toast, finished my oj, and none of the staff got the hint of a full plate of food and a card out (apx 10min), that should be a red flag. I paid 16.00 for this experience and I can't believe I even left a 2.00 tip. I sat down just before 1, they close at 2. If you still have to go, don't go near end of shift/closing. I thought breakfast restaurants were the exception to that rule. First time, mediocre. Second time, \"worth starting a yelp account\" so bad."}
{"text":"I was dropping my car off at the Porsche dealership and looking for a breakfast place nearby. Yelp did not let me down - woo hoo this was a great find!  We sat outside in the perfect weather and enjoyed a great cup of coffee while waiting for our food to arrive.  I had the lemon blueberry mascarpone pancakes and my friend had the pumpkin pancakes. We shared an order of potatoes.  Our food was crazy delicious and the potatoes were probably my favorite I have ever had - crispy with a hint of rosemary.    We had fast, friendly service and I definitely will be back the next time I am in the area!"}
{"text":"I love this place great service, awesome food, the owners and staff are always on point and super friendly.  Totally worth the wait.  Chicken fried steak with a side of homemade sausage is my go to never missed the mark yet. Thanks for what you do."}
{"text":"We looked for a good breakfast spot in east mesa definitely love this place. Decor is cute and very inviting. Staff was friendly. Food was amazing!! Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in on Saturday morning, and we were happy to see all the business Henhouse was getting. We always expect that when a restaurant is busy, service might be slow. But they weren't at all! Our server was great about checking on us and our drinks were filled. She actually let us have a couple bites of our meal before asking how everything tasted (which never happens)! The food was awesome! It tasted homely, but full of flavor and layers. I highly recommend the bruschetta omelet! So so good! The owner was very friendly and made a point of socializing with all the guests. I can definitely see this place having a loyal customer in me!"}
{"text":"Aaaaaaaamazing EVERY time I go. The owner and their kids are awesome. Just.., really a cool place."}
{"text":"I have eaten breakfast here before and it was good. However, my experience yesterday morning April 21 was very poor. I ordered a 2 (scrambled) egg breakfast with sausage, potatoes and toast. The toast was very good, the potatoes were cold and lacked flavor, the sausage patties were something you'd expect from McDonalds, only worse, received only 1 egg which was rubbery, cold and didn't taste like an egg.    My wife, who had eggs benedict, also didn't care for her meal.  Maybe it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here several times and every time the food and service has been spectacular. I recommend the Huevos Rancheros, Chicken fried steak, the Cali Eggs Benedict and their coffee. You can't go wrong with either of these options. Then again, anything you go with is pretty darn good. Enjoy!  Ps. Sabrina, thank you for your great service today.   This place is 'Primetime'."}
{"text":"The food here is the bomb.com! I ordered the \"small\" blueberry pancakes, let me just say, they weren't small at all, they were about 12 inches in diameter! They were delicious, light and fluffy and their maple syrup was also rather tasty. My husband ordered one of their scrambles which he also enjoyed. The staff were friendly and well attentive, they kept our coffee mugs full the entire time. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I could not wait to try this place! I had heard so much about it. We left disappointed. The waitress did greet us and get our drinks right away. From there it was all down hill. We waited over 20 minutes for her to come back to us to take our order. We watched her take the orders of 3 tables that came in after us. When she finally took our order, the food took another 25 minutes to come out. It was luke warm, average food (nothing \"real home made\" about it). It was lunch meat ham sliced thick, not a country ham slice....overall just OK."}
{"text":"I ordered crunchy French toast, advertised as Texas cut bread (thick) dipped in a crunch cereal. I received regular French toast, thin bread. They said they would replace it with the crunch toast. What I got back was 4 thin slices of French toast with a light sprinkling of cereal, almost as if they used the same French toast they originally served me and tried to get some cereal to stick to it. It was NOT thick Texas cut as advertised and was not crunchy at all. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast we've had here in Phoenix area! This place is a must try! Food is on point the pancake is huge and fluffy almost like eating a cake"}
{"text":"Overhyped breakfast spot, unfortunately. We were really excited to try this place out but based on our first experience, we won't bother to come back.  -you'll wait typically 30mins - 1 hour to get seated -food took about the same amount of time to get after you ordered -the food was nothing special (very average for breakfast food)  -watched the server pour decaf coffee into my cup because she didn't want to wait for the normal folgers coffee to finish brewing   Overall just a blah basic breakfast place where you have to wait way too long to eat. Just go to Denny's."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a Saturday and there was a short wait.  It was worth it.   The short stack of pancakes is huge. One was a touch under done but good light fluffy pancakes.  Everyone at the table agreed on that. The green chile pulled pork skillet was very good. Great service also."}
{"text":"Very good food, service was a little spotty also was concerned with some of the servers placing their hands into different areas of their face or on the counters and not washing their hands to serve food and beverages will I go back probably not."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and we found this place on yelp.. The waitress was awesome as well as their coffee. I ordered the carnitas plate with eggs and it was absolutely delicious. The meat was juicy and the green chili salsa was fresh and flavorful. Everyone must come and experience this dish because I sure will miss it back home :)"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! I had the famous pancakes and the house sausage. Wonderful! I met the owners and they are amazing people! I definitely recommend going here! Especially for the price you can't beat!"}
{"text":"I came on a Friday morning with my boyfriend and daughter. Ordered biscuits and gravy and French toast. The French toast was alright, too much vanilla. The biscuits and gravy were also just alright. Tasted like they use liquid smoke. The orange juice tasted like rum was splashed in there. It was strange. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Pancakes are novelty huge, but some of my favorite cakes out there..  the Green Chile skillet is my favorite."}
{"text":"First time...Awesome Lemon Blueberry Mascarpone pancake and scrumptious Green Chile Skillet. Leftovers... We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Went for breakfast at 10am on Saturday, so we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table for two. Not bad.   Had the corned beef hash, which was super fresh and came with sweet potatoes in it, which was great.   My boyfriend got the green chile carnitas breakfast burrito - so so good. I'd probably get that next time I go.   We also ordered a short stack of pancakes. Short is not the right word. These were essentially two pizzas stacked on top of each other. Huge is an understatement. They were amazing and had a touch of cinnamon YUM.   Overall very cozy and welcoming. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast while visiting my dad. There was a wait, but we were seated much faster than the quoted wait time of 30-45 minutes. The service was fair. I think the wait time to order drinks and the wait time for the food were a bit too long. I ordered the Cali Benedict and it was delish! Eggs were very flavorful and the hollandaise was good. I would have liked a little more sauce and more avocado though. The potatoes were amazing also! My husband had the diablo scramble and he loved it. Overall yummy place!!"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful!  Usually a wait, but worth it.  The kids pancake is absolutely enormous and the kids love it!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now with two different groups of friends and both experiences have been great!  The Hen House Cafe has an admirable selection of breakfast foods with unique specials that change all the time.  Good quality ingredients, nice portion sizes and a very consistent experience from visit to visit.  There is generally a wait at breakfast times, but it keeps the atmosphere lively and this is one place I don't mind waiting for.  Service is average in speed, but servers are cordial and I have really enjoyed the personalities of some particular members of the waitstaff, such as Tanner, our server this morning.  Many of the menu items are simple breakfast classics, but every item here is done well.  The house pancakes are huge and delicious and most dishes are well under $10, which really hits a sweet spot when it comes to value.    Overall, a worthy breakfast joint that I would heartily recommend to anyone.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I was able to dine at both locations last weekend! I was impressed by the service and staff at both locations. I had great service at the new location by Shelly. I also was able to chat with the manager Stacy who was also attentive and great! I had the special which was the Cuban sandwich which was so fantastic! It chose the Coleslaw and  I had to have fries too. Both were great, but the fries are outstanding! I had breakfast last Sunday before I had to catch my flight back home at Henhouse 1 original location. I had the Huevos Rancheros! Let me just say... So great! The refried beans are from scratch like everything else, but these were some of the best I have ever tasted. Every single employee that I came in contact with at this location treated me great too. Andre,Rhea, Lizette, Mary,Cole, Misaul &,Santos I am forgetting a few but not forgotten. Next time I am in town, I will for sure make sure to stop in for another amazing meal! Special thank you to Brett and Maureen Grebe the owners for coming over and chatting with me about my home town where they are both originally from."}
{"text":"Sigh, this place is cool and popular. I gave it a mediocre rating though because I ordered pancakes that were so big they filled an extra-large sized pizza box. I'm not kidding. They were huge, so thick that they were unappetizing. The pancakes tasted like sweet bread."}
{"text":"I love the food and the service at Hen house! The veggie skillet & any of their pancakes are the best!"}
{"text":"Delicious!   You have to try the lemon blueberry mascarpone pancake!   Enough for two to share."}
{"text":"Potatoes greasy and not cooked, eggs had a strange flavor, biscuit dry. Gravy was just ok. One of the worst breakfast I have ever had. And it wasn't that busy so really no excuse."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is amazing, fast friendly service and don't forget the delicious coffee"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Came here for the first time since mom and I were going on our way home after visiting Agritopia Farm. It was busy but the service and staff were amazing. Super friendly people, which made the experience even better. Holly helped us and talked to us a bit about the background of the restaurant and she was just as amazing. If we were closer this would definitely be our to-go spot. We'll definitely be going back. Thank you Holly!"}
{"text":"Sweet baby jesus.......  Someone in the kitchen here must really like limes. I was in here yesterday morning for breakfast between jobs and ordered the Santa Fe omelette. Oh my lawd was the guacamole bad. It was loaded with so much lime juice, I couldn't eat it. I am an avid guacamole eater and this was by far the worst I've ever eaten. I love limes and all but someone in that kitchen must love them far more than I do. Or, they were simply having a bad day and just decided to beat the life out of some limes. I mean, it was sickening.  The coffee? Stop. Stop it right now. It was horrendous. Perhaps some of the worst coffee I've ever had and that is a BOLD statement. I have had some bad coffee in my lifetime but this was as if the devil himself brewed it. I couldn't believe it. In the time I was there eating, I noticed six or seven parties sit down and ONLY order water. What?! No coffee drinkers in any of those groups? Well, perhaps they don't like coffee but I think they knew what I didn't before I sat down -- that the coffee was gross. It was so bad that I had to hold my nose in order to drink it. I'm not someone who wastes food/drink and always finish what I'm given but this unbearable. As if the angry kitchen staff brewed the coffee with toilet water.  Wait a moment.. what about the staff? There were two servers that were very nice and hats off to them but there were two women (whom looked like sisters) that walked around as if they were in the mood to murder. They had the most hateful looks on their faces, I was actually scared to bother them for something. \"Excuse me miss. May I have a cup of water?\" WWWWHAAAAAATTTT?! NO! NO WATER, DANIEL! NO WATER FOR YOU! ASK AGAIN AND I WILL KILL YOU! Well, that's not exactly how she said it but close enough.  I was dining by myself as a 1-top so I think perhaps I received half ass service because the server thought she wasn't going to get a tip? Well, I still left her a $7 tip on a $13 bill. No thank you or smile from her. Just a very submissive \"take care\". So, if you are dining alone or perhaps with just yourself and someone else, you will not be getting the same service as a table with 5 or 6. It's absolutely deplorable. As a business owner myself, it's appalling to know these women have jobs still. They're certainly not doing 110% work, so why not have someone else do it for them? There are people who will kill for that job. Stop taking it for granted, woman.  There are too many businesses in the area that are open for breakfast and lunch and will most definitely not be coming back here. I prefer to spend my money at the establishments that appreciate my money and where they don't try to poison you with lime juice.  *gag*   (I noticed that I am like the only one to ever have a bad experience here among all of the Yelpers who reviewed this joint. Strange. It's as if the coffee they were served hypnotized them into writing a wonderful review. But, not me. Mr. Devil, I will not fall for your hypnotic tricks!!)"}
{"text":"I have to say for a basis that I do not like Ihops, Denny's or the like.  I prefer other chains that have better qualty like: Good Egg and Cracker's, etc.  I also like Mom and Pop restaurants if they are excellent.  My first encounter at this restaurant was on a Saturday morning and it was packed! I was not even noticed by the slow staff and decided I would try it another day and left.  Being packed should make a statement on its own except they are fairly new and like Jim Jones and his encampment in Guyana, South America, people will flock to new or fairly new venues by the hundreds.  The second encounter I had with this restaurant was the following Monday at approximately 12:30 and it was basically empty!  There was one server who managed the register as well.  When I was finally greeted and told to sit wherever I wish, of course, I did so and had to wait on silverware, coffee and a napkin for upwards of 7 minutes.  When my food arrived, it had a 3 inch strand of black hair on the plate along with the eggs and potatoes.  I was disgusted and told them that their attention to only one sitting customer was poor and I was disgusted with the hair on my plate so I was leaving never to return again. I could not wait to write the review.  I eat out just about everyday and I know quality establishments.  Look and see if they remain after a year or two.  I doubt it.  These things tend to work themselves out with customers that are astute or aware.  Paying high prices for eggs and potatoes should come with an expectation that they would be impeccable.  My omlette appeared burned but since I did not eat it, I have no idea if it was overcooked, burned or what.  I am done.  Too many restaurants to choose from and this is definitely off of my lists to dine at, despite living in the neighborhood, or take any of my guests too when they visit.  I was truly hoping for a great experience, service or at least food.  I would have taken anyone of the three."}
{"text":"We had breakfast at Henhouse Cafe on Sunday morning about 1030a.m. This is obviously a peak time for them, but you wouldn't know it by the way the staff responded!!! We were quoted a 25-30 minute wait, and we were sat in 15. When our server(Irene) came over, she was courteous and professional with a huge, welcoming smile on her face!! The food came out promptly and tasted amazing!! We will be back again and again!! We highly recommend Henhouse Cafe to everyone!!"}
{"text":"I have updated my review to 5 stars because the greeting we got was friendly, everything was immaculately clean and the food was delicious.  Tasty combinations are offered at the Henhouse. I can't believe the size of the HUGE pancake. It's as big as a pizza and could feed a bunch of little kids!  The eggs Benedict were delicious. The breakfast sandwiches were excellent. Typical breakfast fare (bacon, eggs, pancakes) were done well.  Having come here for lunch a few times, the sandwiches were fantastic and the French fries PERFECTLY COOKED!  The decor is pleasant and the staff are accommodating and knowledgeable.  They offer both indoor and outdoor seating.  Expect a wait during peak times, i.e. Saturday morning.  You'll enjoy the food and may leave with leftovers because the portions are very generous."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service. Pancakes are awesome, they are huge, a short stack filled me up completely. eggs Benedict were also tasty. Prompt service each time I have visited."}
{"text":"Been here twice and loved it both times!  The breakfast burrito is the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. We'll surely be back soon.Thank you"}
{"text":"We had Moma's homemade pancake it was HUGE!!! do not order unless you plan to share with at least 5-7 ppl. Grilled cheese was good just too buttery! Customer service was ok"}
{"text":"I do like this place. I mean I like the menu and the way the place is set up. I just don't like the service we recieved from our waitress today. We ordered the mama's pancakes which is 2 huge pancakes (like 30 inches each) to split anongst three of us. We ordered water and coffee from the beginning but never recieved our water or coffee refills, we did get more coffee creamers though with 2 empy cups of coffee. I kept asking our server for more coffee and to finally give us our water but she never did. About 35 minutes after being seated I decided to get up and get the coffee myself but a different server stopped me and said she would bring it to our table. This other server filled up my cup but not my girl's cup so she was stuck waiting even longer. The water finally came after I asked the manager for some about 40 minutes after we arrived. It's like they wanted us to leave or something. They didn't seem to want us to wash our pancakes down with anything. I asked for more butter since they didnt give us enough for the pancakes we ordered and the server said she would have to charge us extra for each butter. I have never been charged extra for butter for pancakes anywhere else before. I really feel like the workers just didn't want us here for some reason, maybe we came to the wrong place of town where our skin tone isn't accepted. I told the waitress the extra charge for butter was ridiculous and that I would leave a negative review because of it and she basically said she didn't care. All I wanted was 2 more butters. The reciept said our server's name was Mary. I'm not sure if that was in fact her name since didn't have a name tag on her. I was going to give this retaurant 4 or 5 stars but after the horrible experience I had, I had no choice but to knock off a couple of stars. They have a great menu but the service is bad. Only come here if you're getting something to go. I like how everything on the menu seems to come in huge portions. I just wish they were as big on customer service."}
{"text":"The Hen House, with its home style appeal, attempts to make its guests feel comfortable and cozy. We try to make it in at least once a week for my usual, the Kitchen Sink Omelet- without a doubt the most amazing omelet I have ever had! The potatoes are hot and crispy giving them the crunch like appeal; the omelet is filled with an array of vegetables and breakfast meats.  Definitely pay the extra 99 cents to upgrade your bread to the biscuit and gravy. Definitely my favorite breakfast spot in Gilbert!  Yes, it can be a bit crowded on the weekends but aren't most worthwhile restaurants crowded on the weekend with people who have been waiting all week to have their favorite meal prepared just for them?"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal here. The food is stellar and the staff was friendly and courteous. We came here to try it out after my wife searched restaurants in Gilbert, AZ on Google. I definitely will be back. The food here is so good you have to be on guard not to keep eating after you're full. Our server Bailey was outstanding and I hope to see him again when I return."}
{"text":"We heard great things about this place and decided to give it a shot for breakfast and we were sorely disappointed. The food was mediocre and was served lukewarm. The service was slow and inconsistent. We had to request our check from the host stand since the waitress never returned, the owner was visiting most of the tables, but never stopped by ours, and the price was expensive for what we got. The only upside was the french toast special we split was yummy."}
{"text":"Today's service and food were exceptional.  I always get the Cali Benedict.  It is usually good but today it was amazing.  The hollandaise was creamy, bacon crispy, and eggs poached to perfection.  The English muffin was amazing!  I had to ask if it was homemade, my server said no.  She was nice, knew her stuff and checked back like all great servers do.  I wish I could remember her name.  I will definitely be back!  The service has come so far from where it once was!  I didn't see staff sitting around at the bar like I always did in the past.  It's so nice that they have some great ladies and a great cook working now.  It was like a real restaurant today but better!  Thanks for getting your hens in a row Hen House!"}
{"text":"My first visit. Waitress was a bit cold and not very inviting but the food was delicious. She was not friendly at all. Waited longer than I expected but they are a new establishment. I will give them another chance because I loved the food but customer service needs a little more work. More smiles, please!"}
{"text":"So, I saw a sign stating this was rated #1 breakfast restaurant in Gilbert??? I can honestly see why. It's SOO good We got the Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup combo, the Paul Bunyan (2 eggs, 2 bacons, 2 sausages, potatoes, and 1/2 order of French toast), and the Chicken and Waffles. The Paul Bunyan was alright. It was just your typical breakfast dish? BUT I was incredibly pleased with the Chicken and Waffles and Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup. The chicken was soo crispy and tender. It complimented the waffle pretty well and don't getmestarted on the grilled cheese and soup!! The toast from the grilled cheese was cooked to perfection. Idk how, but the cheese to bacon ratio honestly worked so well with each other. To top it off, the tomato soup was probably one of the best I've ever had Anyway, I'm still reminiscing my meal right now so I'll definitely be back soon. I'm sure of it. Go give Gilbert's best breakfast restaurant a shot. I don't think you'll regret it"}
{"text":"We tried this place out for breakfast as the other reviews were good. this place is just OK we had four people in our party two of us  ordered omelettes with the avocado. I'm one of those people and I'm low-carb so I asked if I could substitute the potatoes and toast for a little bowl of fruit and they told me there would be an up charge of a few bucks and the only fruit they had was melon and so I declined. The other two people ordered a burrito breakfast as well as just an egg and bacon breakfast their food looked pretty good. But they said the same, just ok.  it was just slightly disappointing after waiting for 45 minutes to get a table. Overall my service was friendly and my food was decent. Solid three stars."}
{"text":"Came her for breakfast with the family.  Food was pretty good, but nothing spectacular that made me shout  \"OMG, this is the best ever.\"  The service was definitely the downfall of this place.  Took 45 minutes from the time of seating to get our food, 35 minutes from the time of ordering.  The place was not packed and we were one of two tables outside even occupied.  Only had a party of four with basic orders.  There were other groups that came after us which voiced their displeasure and made it known the service was bad.  I would give it another shot, but there are far better places to go to which have better food and service which I would visit before going back."}
{"text":"Sloooooooow!!!!!  Waited 30 min to get a table then an hour for my food. Waitress only excuse was \"sorry we are busy\"."}
{"text":"VERY VERY LOUD!!!!!  We ate there and could bare talk to each other. We finally gave up trying to converse.   Food was mediocre. Could not taste the chorizo in one of the omelets, several said their food was not great, and that they were disappointed.   Place was jammed and people were crammed together. Will most likely our last visit."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time. My husband got the biscuits and gravy.the two biscuits were hard as a rock, maybe 1/2 cup of gravy, not enough, cost extra for more gravy. I got the Green Chili Skillet, very little meat, mostly Potatoes. People there were very nice, but don't think we will go back..."}
{"text":"I keep hearing people talk about this place, so we had to try it. It's pretty mediocre. I wasn't impressed nor was I unimpressed by the food. They do have a stack of pancakes that's ridiculously huge though! We had a pretty long wait, but that wasn't really a big deal. We were expecting to wait anyway because of how much we had heard about it. Since they were really busy, I wasn't expecting to get great service... so when our server gave us the bill, but ran someone else's credit card for us and ours for them, I wasn't surprised. I felt bad for her though because she seemed pretty overwhelmed. Then the manager who was fixing it for her started lecturing her in front of all the customers, including us. The manager was too hard on her for a little mistake. There was no need to embarrass her. I actually would try it again and give them another chance. Everyone makes mistakes and hers was so innocent. I would actually like to go back to see if they do a better job with the food."}
{"text":"The food is amazing however, without fail, we have had to wait over an hour to get our meal no matter how many times we come on a Sunday morning. We have been apologized to and comped almost every time because they can not seem to get our food out to us in under an hour. Extremely disappointing because of how delicious the food is. But the wait is going to keep me from coming back..."}
{"text":"I had to downgrade my previous 5 star rating based on a recent visit that was fraught with problems.  I wish I could give a better rating and I sure hope my latest experience was only a temporary downturn for this restaurant.  On a very busy day (Memorial Day) I visited with my parents and wife.  We were told there was a 45 minute wait and we thought that was OK, since it was obviously busy.  However, we were called to our table LONG after 45 minutes had elapsed.  As a side note - the tables didn't seem to be managed very well - some sat empty for what seemed a long time even though patrons were waiting.  Lisa came to take our drink orders but told us she wasn't our waitress.  We were ready to order since we'd had nearly forever to look at the menu and our waitress never showed!   After a while Lisa returned to the table and told us that she actually was our waitress and took our orders.  It was about 12:50, two hours after we first arrived, when the food finally came.  Several other tables that were seated after us received their orders while we waited.    We asked for the manager and the check because we had a 1:30 appointment.  My wife's waffle was tough (how does that happen?), she wasn't served the eggs that she had ordered, and the blueberries appeared previously frozen though they had claimed fresh.  The rest of the meals were not in error, but potatoes served with them were a bit under done.    To the restaurant's credit, Lisa's manager was receptive to our complaints and apologetic -  he discounted the bill to make up for our lost morning and listened to us.  To her credit, Lisa was super pleasant and apologetic.  I don't think that she has the blame.  Still, there's some blame that falls on the staff - someone should have set expectations appropriately, managed the work load for the kitchen, and rode quality control on the orders.  I'm going to hope this was a rogue wave of staff absences and high demand that put this place off its rails."}
{"text":"We ate there for the first time today (4/7/2018) and it was super packed! So we figured that was a good sign. We had to wait for a table (about 20 min) which went by pretty quickly. Our server was very friendly, although I didn't catch his name (he probably told me, I just forgot immediately as that always happens). He suggested several things off the menu which  I really appreciated (I hate it when servers say \"everything is good!\") my hubs ordered the chicken and waffles and said that they were phenomenal. I ordered the biscuits and gravy and sausage, eggs and potatoes. It was super good, although I'm a huge potato fan, and I didn't enjoy them as much. We interacted with several of the wait staff and they were all very friendly. I did have one major complaint though, they didn't have a changing table in the bathroom. There's plenty of space for one! Overall this place has great food!"}
{"text":"My friend and his family took me here because they raved about the food. The food is absolutely delicious!!! The portion sizes are massive. I had the chorizo burrito which was very good. The biscuits and gravy was also very delicious. The crumble French toast is out of this world. I urge you to try this place. Great prices also! Our server disappeared for a while here and there which was disappointing because it was early and there was only 3 tables. I let  it slide because the food is great!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant seems to be busting at the seams on Saturday and Sunday mornings. This place keeps busy, and for a good reason; people seem to love the food here.   Others kept getting seated before us because we had to wait for a table (not a booth) because we needed to use a high chair for our baby.  I'm supposing this place could still do good business if it had room for 15 more tables (inside the restaurant).  Liked that there was the outdoor seating option- big picnic tables. But, I didn't appreciate the guy smoking nearby, especially because we could've sat outside and. Ot waited for a table inside but didn't want our baby breathing in that crap.  Maybe Henhouse can post a visible \"No Smoking\" sign outside.   As for the food, I was wanting the Biscuit & Gravy breakfast but I ordered the Chicken & Waffle (with over-hard eggs, and 3 types of sauce- syrup, spicy syrup & gravy) and glad I did!  It was so good!    Way tastier than Lolo's Chicken & Waffles!!  I would get this again!  Waffle was crisp, not soggy. Chicken breast had a great seasoning taste & the breading was just right and crisp, too!  Powdered sugar added the right sweet touch. Super filling meal!  Finished the chicken but not the waffle & was too full to eat the eggs.  Eggs appeared to be cooked just as I'd ordered. My unsweetened iced tea was strong and fresh brewed.   My (hard to please) husband liked the Country Burrito --he said it had a bit too many onions. Good for a big appetite.  Great suggestion from our server!  Mother-in-law had a Biscuit & Gravy al la carte. She wasn't disappointed.   We had a friendly, clean cut, male server that checked in at the right times, kept our drinks filled & understood the menu.  Pleasant service.   In my next couple of visits, I want to try the Biscuit & Gravy and the homemade Cinnamon Roll.  Thanks Henhouse!  Glad you're near our part of town! We will be back."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast/brunch. You'll expect a wait during weekend peak breakfast times. A variety of options on the menu and the pancakes are large! Go with the recommended items that they suggest if your a first timer here. Relaxing atmosphere and outdoor seating.   Downside bathrooms don't have baby changing table."}
{"text":"As a former resident of Gilbert, I'm familiar with this joint... I was excited to see a new location less than a mile from my new home in Mesa! Mid Saturday morning & we were seated right away, no wait. After ordering, our food was delivered in less than 10 minutes. The Grandpa Skillet & CFS were both awesome!  Also... ask for Courtney's section! She was great!"}
{"text":"Average breakfast place that tremendously overlooks customers basic needs, i.e. Water, refills, service, etc.  The is just sad to watch, they run around like chickens with their heads cut off. You can see the anxiety in their faces. Henhouse focuses on the quantity of their food opposed to the quality. I would say to give this place a try if you're willing to wait 30-35 minutes, and we waited 15 min just to be served with drinks. Overall, the food here is average at most and it shows especially in the service of Henhouse. It is comparable to your average Denny's, ihop or ma-pop breakfast/brunch establishments."}
{"text":"The Henhouse Breakfast sandwich has got to be the best breakfast sandwich I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Combine top quality ingredients, with people that have a passion for cooking food and serving people, and you have the recipe for the best breakfast ever! Do not hesitate, do not wait, go immediately to Henhouse, order ANYTHING... You will not be disappointed. Top-notch service from the reception desk to your server to the bus crew to the kitchen staff. Can't say enough good things... Our favorite breakfast joint ever."}
{"text":"I went here this a.m for the first time in a date. We shared a lemon blueberry pancake for an appetizer cause well, you need an appetizer for breakfast. We got the smaller size and it was still HUGE. So dang good tho. I got the heart healthy wrap and it was DELICIOUS. It had egg whites, back, avocado and yams. Healthy and on point. The person I went with got the California crab omelette and I tried the potatoes that came with the omelette and those were life. This place was good and I'd legit be coming back."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for breakfast and I'm highly disappointed. First I ordered a soda and it came on a dirty glass asked for a new one and that too had stuff floating in it. Then I ordered a side of bacon and fruit both were  disgusting never had fruit so bad and how do you mess up bacon then to add insult to injury the chicken fried steak breakfast had a hair in it. Pretty much won't be back was a waste of money and time seeing as I'm still hungry hopeful they clean their cups and watch the hair in the food. Truly a very sad experience"}
{"text":"Great place for Breakfast!!! Great food and friendly staff.. Giant pancakes !!!! all the right stuff for Saturday breakfast !!!!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast joint. First timer and we tried the diablo scramble and cali Benedict! Nice environment as well. We really want to try the pancakes but are too stuffed."}
{"text":"Might be my new breakfast place, I give 4 instead of 5 because the massive one pancakes were chewy and not fluffy. It could be due to size but it's something they are known for so I was a little disappointed.  The chorizo gravy is to die for."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is awesome. So far just had breakfast, but will definitely be back for lunch. Waffles are to die for, best bacon I've ever had."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday morning and while it was busy we got right in. The food was great. My mom had french toast and I had biscuits and gravy. I'm picky because I'm from the Midwest where we know that sausage gravy means ground sausage, not sausage links in the gravy! But they passed the test. The french toast had a hint of orange and was delicious.  They seemed well staffed and lots of people came around offering coffee refills etc. but our server was little spacey. Had to repeatedly ask for silverware. Maybe he was new or having an off day. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Keeping it short and sweet for you folks:  PROS: - sausage done in house. Delicious - great variety of breakfast burritos. Their a decent size, even though potato is used as the filler to get it to that large size.  - coffee is actually decent.  - giant pancakes (when I say giant I mean HUGE!) - plenty of meaty options    CONS: - don't bother coming a few hours Before they close. Crappy service and food is leftovers from the morning (clearly not as fresh and delicious).    come on the weekends. The earlier the better. It's busy as hell during their peak times but it can be worth the wait."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here this morning.  It was around 11am and they were very busy, but we got right in to a table.  Ordered coffee and it comes in a huge mug with half and half creamer cups on the table.  We had previously looked at the menu online the night before so we knew what we were going to order.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken, wife ordered the Southern Benedict (which she wanted me to add that this is unique to this restaurant).  Preston, our waiter, was on the ball and was right there to fill our coffee just as it was empty.  Our food came in the normal amount of time which was surprising considering how busy they were.  It was truly fantastic!  Their english muffins appear to be fresh baked.  We also ordered a side of sausage to split because they make it fresh there as well.  Our entire experience was excellent.  After we ate our meal we sat there drinking our coffee and watched as they brought out food for other tables.  I found myself ooo'ing and ahh'ing and everything that came out.  We will definitely be coming back to this gem."}
{"text":"This is our go to for breakfast.  I always order the French Toast it is the perfect indulgence.  Hubby loves the green chili skillet, make sure to get the potatoes crispy.  And the pancakes are HUGE!!!! Who can eat more than one of them?  Great place, you won't be disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to have breakfast.  It's almost always busy, so expect to wait a few minutes for a table.  Is is worth the wait you ask?  Yes, yes it is.  The French Toast has got to be my all time favorite, I got it every time.  The vanilla custard mixture it is dipped in puts it over the top.  Sausage is good, not the best I've had, could use a little sage to round it out, but overall it is a nice solid sausage patty. My husband LOVES and highly recommends the green chili skillet, potatoes crisp, trust me.... The OJ Is high quality served in a mason jar(cute).  If I can't have a great glass of OJ with my breakfast, forget it.  Super friendly staff, kitschy decorations.  From one restaurant person to the next the set up for the servers could use some work(this is for you....owners).  They have a few locations to choose from, choose whichever is closest to you as the quality and service is great across the board"}
{"text":"Sat there for about 10 minutes without any service. There were 2 servers on the floor who couldn't be bothered to acknowledge me whatsoever. I get it, I'm a 1-top, and in your eyes, you're not getting as much in tip and therefor I am less of a priority. But guess what? I'm one of the $5 1-tops if I can just get some halfway decent service. It's why people go out to eat. Not for your crappy overpriced food."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of enjoying breakfast here with my son. We didnt have a wait to be seated but if you do... it will be worth it. Our sever Andre was very friendly and attentive, the food was delicious loved the homemade salsa. One thing I noticed and says a lot about the place is that the owners were chatting with customers on a warm personal level, I'm sure this place has quite a few regulars it's a cute breakfast establishment with friendly service and great food. (If they're serving albondigas soup... do your tummy a favor and try it... Yummmmy!)"}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions, and cheap prices make this a staple in my weekend breakfast rotation.  I'd like to see someone polish off those massive pancakes!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast/brunch choices. I had the French dip sandwich. Lots of meat. My wife has a breakfast with fried chicken and biscuits and gravy with bacon. Not used to cheese on the bacon. It's was okay though. The chicken was a little dry.  The fries were awesome. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Nothing can make up for POOR SERVICE!   The host calls your name and doesn't greet you or say anything and just leads you to be seated. When we arrived to our booth, the table was sticky and waited for approx 10 minutes before female serve came to ask if we had drink orders taken. She took our orders and promptly returned with them. She was very friendly - to bad we didn't have her for the rest of our experience maybe we would have felt differently.   Our server should bus tables or find a new profession. He came to the table while we were looking at our menu and leaned up against the booth. We thought because the place so busy and it's small he stopped there to let someone pass until we heard him say are you guys ready or should I hang out for bit until your ready? That was the beginning g if the end with his service. He never came back asking if we needed refills on coffee, how the meal was, only came over towards the end and wanted to know if that was an extra cup or if we needed coffee in a cup that originally had been served tea. Then while still eating comes over and says looks like your done I'll get your ticket. In addition to his he forgot items and we had to ask other servers for them.  The food was good and the size portions were big for the price.  Overall an unfriendly environment, serving good food but can go elsewhere for good food and GOOD SERVICE."}
{"text":"Decided to go to the hen house for breakfast. Whatever you do order a side of the crispy potatoes. They're to die for.  The service was good, food came out quick. This place is definitely better than the other breakfast joints nearby. The green chili skillet was solid. Check this place out for sure just don't show up late or you'll have to wait."}
{"text":"When we arrived we were greeted and told a wait time of 45 minutes. 25 minutes later we were called. Our waitress introduced herself and took our beverage order. 7 minutes later our drinks finally arrived and asked if we were ready to order, we all placed our order in. 40 MINUTES LATER our food finally arrived! That took one star away! Our waitress didn't even apologize for the long wait. My brother order a side of pancakes that never arrived and my sister order cheese in her burger and her burger was all wrong. She didn't even refill our drinks, minus 1 star. I don't think will be coming back, we will Stick with our favorite Sunday place \"The Good Egg\"."}
{"text":"We loved this place!!!! The quality is on point. My husband ordered the crunchy French toast and I ordered the biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs soft and a side of bacon. The biscuit was super soft and the gravy was homemade. The bacon was hearty and flavorful. The French toast was so good. It was a flavor I've never had before. I will definitely be back to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast spot! Quick wobderful service,  atmosphere is shabby farm chic, and Eggs Benedict was fantastic!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, lack in seasoning so the salt and pepper thats on the table is essential. The potatoes were very crispy/kinda burnt. I like it that way but if I didnt i wouldve sent it back. The people there are really nice the food is ok not bad. Just the lack of any seasoning is odd for me potatoes and eggs need a little something.."}
{"text":"Waitress Jennifer was amazing! She explained the menu thoroughly and the food came out so delicious. We didn't wait long for the food and it was fresh. Portions were huge and well worth the price. Atmosphere is family friendly. If you're looking for a gem, check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today...My lunch pal had the BLTA and I had the SW Chicken Wrap.  Thank you so much for using a quality tortilla and not some flavored one that has so much preservative on it that it tastes like wax!!  The chicken had VERY good flavor and it was a good size.  I got the side salad with it and while I feel they were a bit skimpy with the salad, it was still good.  The fries were very tasty!  Crispy and flavorful.  Loved the decor too!  This place beats the heck out of Kneaders.....I am happy to pay $8 for a lunch I am going to like!"}
{"text":"This place has great food but I've been here before and the service was terrible. I mean so bad I almost walked in to get my own food and coffee. We went back to get the ridiculously awesome corned beef hash and DERIK was our server on a Sunday morning. DERIK was an actual waiter. He brought hot coffee repeatedly and without being promoted! He was delightful! He was proactive. He made our meal even better. Kudos. I actually look forward to returning."}
{"text":"OMFG!!!!       I remember this place back when it was located on Chandler Heights Rd.  I met the owner and he hooked me up with a bomb breakfast. I never made it back.     My ex wife had mentioned the name the other day and I asked if it was the same joint. Low and effing behold. 2.5 miles from my house.........THE HEN HOUSE!! And it is still amazing. My server was chill and somewhat prompt. One negative point; he forgot to keep my coffee full.     I ordered The Barn Burner. IT WAS FANTASTIC!!!  And priced perfectly. Atmosphere is nice. I'm now a regular and  will be returning almost every weekend.   Buh Bye Black Bear Diner!!!"}
{"text":"Very yummy and friendly place. We all had to try my husband's made from scratch sausage, which was impressive. My chicken fried chicken was better than expected; the chicken was so moist, the crunchy part was great, and the sausage gravy excellent and plentiful. The chicken fried chicken also came with fried potatoes, two eggs and toast. I couldn't eat it all.   We were so happy to find such a good place in this area. The only thing I would recommend would be for them to invest in something to make it less noisy in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food.. would be nice if they threw in a changing table,  but. . The food is amazing"}
{"text":"Yummy! I ALWAYS order the Belgian waffle, with sides of eggs, bacon and potatoes and I am always so full and satisfied when I leave. Their waffle is absolutely delicious and kind of sweet. And I absolutely love the way they make their potatoes! The staff is always nice and I really like how homey the place is. A+ from me!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for homemade breakfast. Great friendly staff, never have been disappointed."}
{"text":"Henhouse used to be my favorite breakfast place.  We used to go to the original location almost every weekend and I was very pleased when we  discovered that this location was opening because it is so close to our house.  This location is good, but it never quite lived up to the same level as the original location.  The large, plate sized pancakes are the gimmick they are known for and we really liked them.  Lately, they have been a bit hit and miss - on 2 recent visits, we got underdone pancakes with the middles really soft and unappetizing. We haven't ordered any pancakes since.  The waffles are good and the french toast is average.  The \"home-made\" maple syrup is great - at first it seems more watery than store bought, but the taste is exceptional.  My husband and I both have the same favorite.  It's called the Farm Boy.  It's an omelette with cheese, sausage, ham and bacon.  I prefer hash browns to their house potatoes, but I ask for them to be \"a little extra crispy\" and they often come out good.  The portion sizes at Henhouse are ginormous, so we never leave hungry.  If the potatoes aren't good on a particular visit, it's ok - there is more than enough other food on the plate.  My son's favorite is the biscuits and gravy - the gravy and sausage both taste as if they were freshly made that morning.  My DIL loves the Diablo Scramble.  It's not my cup of tea, but it must be good because she gets it every time we go!  Like many of the other reviews state, the biggest downside to Henhouse are the long wait times.  The wait is usually not as long as they tell you, but if it is longer than 20-30 minutes, we go somewhere else.  The wait staff is friendly, but because it is always so busy, they are often unable to be as attentive as I'd like.  Oftentimes, we find ourselves getting up to go find someone to get us what we need.  Waiting for the overly busy server to notice we need something just takes too long.  I'm very unhappy about the switch from Coke products to Pepsi products, but that's a highly subjective criticism.  I am glad however, that they let me bring in my own Diet Coke to drink.  Overall, Henhouse is a decent breakfast place, but if I'm going to wait a long time for breakfast, I expect first class service and consistent, high quality food.  I just can't say that about Henhouse.  It almost certainly won't be terrible, but it may or may not be worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best family owned restaurants for breakfast.  Strawberry cheesecake french toast is to die for. Chicken and waffle is awesome with their special swett and spicy syrup. Their customer service is exceptional."}
{"text":"Henhouse Cafe is one of those diners that everybody seems to know about, if only because of their wall of awards and long wait.  The food here is great, and the price is definitely right. The chorizo burrito was a massive beast that filled me up for most of the day, while the chicken fried chicken was very tender. Coffee is surprisingly strong too - I wouldn't be surprised if it's a local blend."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times amd have enjoyed both the food and service.  Today we ordered a veggie omlett with chicken breast, waffle with whip and strawberries and kids french toast meal with a scramble egg and a bacon. Also two chocolate milks for the kids.  Total price was $33.00.  Positive: Service was excellent.  Food taste: Omlett was ok, not as good from my previous visits.                       Waffle was relatively small for the $7.00 price. There was an additional cost for whip and strawberries, which brought the price to around $10.00. In short not a good value at all.                        Kids French toast meal was ok.  Chocolate milk taste like sugar water. When it came out looking really light I asked the second server if we had to stir the choc in the milk. She said no.  Overall a real disappointment. This place is usually better. But not this time.  The server was very good. Too bad the cook was not."}
{"text":"This is for the Hen House located on Lindsay Rd. We had the veggies omletts and 2 waffles. Cost was  approximately $40.00.  The breakfast was excellent and cooked just right.  And as always in both locations, service was excellent."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for breakfast when I go I try to try something different on every visit but sometimes is a bit hard cause the last meal was so good you don't want to be disappointed ( Which I haven't yet ) so if your looking for a good spot for breakfast with family or friends visiting go try this place."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to visit at least once a month. The place appears clean and the owners do a good job at meet-and-greet. The quality of staff has been hit-and-miss but mostly accommodating as needed. The food is your average \"kitchen food,\" nothing to brag about.  As noted in a previous review, the staff, along with the owners, need to stop eating food where the customers can see them. To top it off, I saw some of them licking their fingers after shoving their food down their pipes. They need to be more cognizant customers do judge the place by how the employees conduct themselves."}
{"text":"I'm giving one star to this restaurant, only because there food is good. Other than that everything else is terrible. We just sat there for 10-15 min without being greeted or even acknowledged. We had a manager walk past us about 5 times and never even noticed us. Not to mention we also were sitting in the middle of the restaurant while there was a few tables in there. Normally we wouldn't be as mad as we are, but the past few times we've been in there service has been awful. This was the second time we've walked out for not being greeted due to no service. Due to horrible service and manager awareness we won't ever be going back. Decent food, consistently horrible service!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't anything special.  I ordered the  blueberry pancakes they were super large and tasted ok but they had hardly any blueberries.  Big bummer.  My husband had some sort of chipotle biscuits with gravy that sounded great... But he didn't like. service was very good the restaurant itself seemed nice and clean.  but as far as breakfast goes we probably won't be returning"}
{"text":"Would have been 5 star if they knew how to cook eggs. Everything was great besides the hardboiled eggs on the benedicts. Good service, good coffee. Great potatoes. Omelette was good. Hollendaise sauce was good. I plan to go back and hope it was just a first week issue and the cooks figure out how to poach an egg."}
{"text":"I am disappointed because my husband and I went to breakfast here and we both ordered omelettes. Omelettes come with potatoes and toast and we didn't want those so we asked to substitute for something else and they added an up-charge for the littlest things. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Overall this was a great dining experience, and the breakfast was absolutely delicious. I had a Belgian waffle which was one of the best - it was light and fluffy yet packed with flavor. I would highly recommend this breakfast joint to others!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was even better. Our server Olivia was the best waitress we have had anywhere in a very long time. She was courteous and pleasant. She was right on top of anything we needed."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast there and it wasn't to busy. We had an awesome waiter with a very friendly disposition.... The reason I am giving out 1 star is because of the attitude of the owner... I had ordered my eggs over medium and they were brought out over easy. The waiter was very nice and had them redo it but when they came out the second time they were again over easy.... The waiter apologized and I had told him to forget about the eggs....He wanted to try again and when they brought them out the 3rd time the owner brought them to me, did not appologize she said that these were over medium well and that they should be fine. I told her I needed to check because the yolk was still runny and she proceeded to tell me that she has already thrown again to many eggs and if touched these they would have to be thrown away.... The eggs were burnt on the outside people. I did tell her then they should have been cooked right the first time. I didn't mean to be rude but she shouldn't have made that comment to me. They were cooking the eggs to fast on a way to hot griddle/skillet. They were burnt on the outside yet the inside was still gooey white...not a over medium egg..... Will not go there again because of the owners attitude and will not recomend this place to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"This is my number one breakfast spot in Gilbert. All of the food tastes homemade. The portion sizes are huge so you get a lot for the money you spend. It also has a very friendly feel to it always great service and staff."}
{"text":"Hen house cafe is refreshing! I'm gonna Say it's one of the best restaurants I've been to truely a neighborhood treasure!!! My wife and I have eaten here about five times and everytime it's just as good, friendly staff, fast service in a clean and very comfortable setting, not to mention the food which is there best atribute!!!!! I highly recommend this place....."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with the family. Food was incredible and the service was great. Best breakfast around."}
{"text":"YES YES YES!!!  GREAT breakfast at a great price!  First timer, got the chicken fried steak and eggs with potatoes and biscuit and gravy and its is SOOOOO GOOD!!! The potatoes are amazing!! And they even gave me some burnt crisp potatoes!! I LOVE the burnt parts! Bacons on point!!! The food is GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and amazing food. \"The Kitchen Sink\" omelet was out of this world and I high recommend it!"}
{"text":"The restaurant came highly recommended, but was a major disappointment from the start. We were seated at a tiny table, which was dirty,right by the counter which the servers pass by. When I requested a different table I was told that the hostess would have to ask. After what seemed like an eternity, we were moved to a booth. The service was terribly slow. 25 minutes for two breakfasts. One, which was southwest biscuits and gravy which were dry. When I requested additional gravy, I was told that I would have to pay an additional charge. I objected as two small, tasteless, pieces of sausage was an up charge of $1.99 and the coffee was bland to say the least. I am a huge supporter of local business, but this will not be one of them.. Overpriced and very slow service."}
{"text":"Oh my was this a great pick. Seriously the best breakfast date my wife and I have had in town. Heck it even beats most of our vacation breakfasts as well!!!   Very large portions. The breakfast sandwiches beat out the break fast burrito, but both were divine. Happy we found this place. See you again real soon!"}
{"text":"We were seated right away at 9am on a Saturday. Santa Fe Omlette was our favorite. Employees were very attentive!. Will be back."}
{"text":"Usually the service is adequate. Today we've waited nearly an hour for our food to get to the table. It seems the kitchen is understaffed. Being its a holiday and more people are off, you'd think they would have anticipated a larger crowd!"}
{"text":"Not impressed, went for breakfast...ordered Biscuits and gravy with potatoes and scrambled eggs...food arrived cold, potatoes are sliced to thick and do not cook all the way through and don't crisp at all, biscuit was dry and tough, gravy bland and boring...ran out of gravy before I finished the biscuit....for this place to survive against the many awesome breakfast places in Gilbert, they need to rise to the occasion and step up there food, service, pricing and the decor is sparse and needs some improvement."}
{"text":"NOT family friendly. Horrible service and management. Heard horrible things about ownership and mistreatment of families with little children. I will never go there because of their horrible experience."}
{"text":"Food was good. Don't sit at the bar, I might as well of been sitting in the server prep station. I don't want to hear about who took what table when I am trying to enjoy my breakfast."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Never seen my kids eat so much in my entire life lol. I'm a head chef of a restaurant and have to say this was quite possibly the best breakfast food I have ever had. 5 star service, 5 star food. Definitely a lot of bang for your buck!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came on a bust Sunday morning. Service wasn't great but that's to be expected, given the number of diners. What was inexcusable was the food. I ordered a special Irish eggs Benedict. The first time it came out with eggs hard as hockey pucks. I sent it back. The next time it came out with eggs that had uncooked whites, from one extreme to the other. Manager took the meal off and asked if I wanted anything else but by this time my husband was about done eating so I declined. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We knew that we were going to have a bad experience when we were told that we would get water by three different servers and not a drop showed up. I had to ask the server to get the lady with the coffee pot for a refill after she walked past me twice without stopping. After waiting for over 40 minutes for our food, we already had enough of this place. Will not be back."}
{"text":"The Henhouse Cafe has horrible customer service. Terrible management.  At first glance, the place has decent food. However, the lack of customer service and the lack of management skills at this restaurant makes it one that you should skip at all costs.   I used to patronize this place at least weekly, but never again.   I was in a referral group that met there every other week, but management could never remember to put our meeting in the books so the room was never set up for us.  And now, for today's downer. I like my potatoes crispy and my sausage done; after all, it is sausage.   I expressed this to my server stating \"I want my sausage well done and my potatoes crispy, like burnt.\"  My food came to me and the potatoes were not crispy and the sausage was not well done.   The server asked, \"is that crispy enough?\" I said, \"no.\" And before I could even tell him about my sausage, he took the potatoes away. Five minutes later, with no server interaction in between, my potatoes came back. The server asked, \"is everything else, okay?\" and I told him about the sausage. He took the plate and walked away, sans comment. Had he waited 2 seconds more, I could have told him that he forgot to bring butter for my pancakes, but he didn't.   5 minutes later, the sausage came back and it was this weird color brown, as if it had been in a deep fryer. I don't desire to die of a heart attack from grease overload, I just don't enjoy eating raw pork. When the server dropped the sausage off, he dropped it as he walked by, so I still did not have a opportunity to say anything about wanting butter.   5 minutes later, he returned and I asked for some butter for my now cold pancake.   He brought the butter.   5 minutes later he dropped off the check and I asked to speak to the manager, and this is where the story gets even worse.   The manager, Bo, was very defensive and repeatedly interrupted me when I tried to tell him about my experience.   For instance, I stated, \"I like to eat my food when it's hot and all together.\" He stated, \"well it was all together, you just sent it back.\"  Me - \"Well I want to gauge what should I say to get my potatoes crispy, the way I like them, on the first time?\"  Him - \"say you want them so burnt they are inedible.\" Me - \"That is rather rude.\" Him - \"Well, I can't tell you what you like but my kitchen did nothing wrong.\" Me -\"Bo, I am just trying to tell you about my poor experience in your restaurant.\" Him - \"No, you are telling me you had a problem with the food, not the experience.\" Me - \"Well, it was a poor experience, the server set the sausage down while rushing by and I couldn't tell him about the other missing items.\" Him - \"No, he didn't.  At that point, I was deflated and frustrated about the experience so I simply paid and left.  I hope whoever reads this does NOT patronize The Henhouse Cafe, located at 3244 E Guadalupe Rd, Gilbert, AZ 85234."}
{"text":"Food was just okay, but too pricey for what you got.  I like restaurants with the kitchen open to the dining room (Pei Wei / Arrogant Butcher) - it's fun to watch the chefs do their thing like a rehearsed dance.  What's not fun is watching the staff bicker and frustrate one another.  This made our visit more stressful than entertaining.  Wait staff was slow and not very attentive - thought about giving it another try, but it looks like this is all pretty common according to other reviews."}
{"text":"Great food! If only given four stars cause the service was pretty slow. We had a great server though! I think the fact that we got in there at 1 ok when the closed at 2 was a factor but other than that, great food! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"This was my wifes first visit, and my second visit!  I crossfit just a few doors down and was craving an omelet after a workout one day so I decided to give them a shot.  It was pretty empty on my first visit, and relatively empty the second visit as well.  Both experiences provided great service and a good meal."}
{"text":"Most awesome Breakfast! Atmosphere is very friendly and upbeat. Homemade sausage, fresh homemade bread! My husband loved the Tamale Breakfast plate. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and service was fast and friendly!  My husband had an omelette he really enjoyed and I had the chicken and waffle.  The boneless chicken breast was perfectly done, crispy and juicy!  It was served with this amazing \"spicy syrup\" which was like nothing I've ever tasted...awesome!!  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Such a good little place for breakfast! We have been here two times now, and will visit again soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered HenHouse through a friend a year ago, and we go now more often than our friend does now. The green chili skillet is to die for! Today, I would like to recognize an attentive waiter, Mike. My husband and I noticed how attentive he was, to everyone, including our table. It's so difficult sometimes to find such an attentive waiter, especially during the busy time that we went today. I am in healthcare as a PA, and it is difficult to find attentive staff. When you come across a good employee, it's important to recognize them! Keep up the good work Mike and Henhouse!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for my husbands birthday.  We heard how great the moms homemade pancakes were, and decided to order them, SO YUMMY!  We were not able to finish them and had to take them home, and to our surprise they were even better the next day!  Highly recommend!  The only negative I could think of in this place, if I really had to think of one, only French vanilla flavored creamer.  was hoping for hazelnut."}
{"text":"There are two breakfast spots that I LOVE. Henhouse being one of them! If you drop in on a weekend be sure to have some time on your hands. It's a wait but for good reason. The food is fantastic! I always get The Kitchen Sink omelet. Coffee is good and the service is great!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we tried this place because we love the original location. Sadly on both occasions we were disappointed. It is one thing to wait a long time for a table but the wait for food once you order is way too long. Once the food came you can tell they rushed. My poached eggs were hockey pucks and the kids scrambled egg portion could fit in a tablespoon. We came back to give this place a second chance but never again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst customer service and horrible food. Did not think you could go wrong with french toast. Even after voicing our opinion to the owners we were brushed off. Totally disappointing."}
{"text":"It was just ok. The eggs Benedict were very dry. They put about a teaspoon of sauce on it. Not enough. Should have gotten a side of sauce. The meat wasn't great quality. Cheap bready English muffin. The whole thing was sort of bland. Potatoes are undercooked and bland as well with skins. Hate potato with skin! I had the best eggs Benedict ever at a breakfast place in north Phoenix called \"brothers\" and haven't found anything that measures up yet. They use organic eggs at brothers and the yolks are orange and tasty and their homemade sauce is amazing.   Hubby got the \"pancake.\" It was huge but it didn't taste good. Guess I prefer quality over quantity."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast there this morning.  We were a large group and our waitress did an amazing job.  The food was awesome and large quantities.  The owner came over and talked with everyone.  Looking around you could see happy employees.  Happy employees means happy customers."}
{"text":"We ordered a few items a la carte so we could taste a few of the various menu items lauded in reviews.   They had a special that day that our waitress said was the best thing on the menu in her opinion. I'm a sucker for comments like this so I decided to try it: a hamburger with a fried green tomatoes and pimento cheese spread. I'm a huge breakfast fan so I have no idea why I decided to do this but... It was good. HUGE, not great, but good. So huge that we had a charity dinner to go to 6-7 hours later and I was still stuffed to the gills.   The burger was quality meat, a huge patty (bigger than I prefer), the pimento cheese was generously piled on and the fried green tomato was good. Not amazing, but good. For my side we chose coleslaw, which we really liked, so much so that my husband ate it all. It's the mayo, sweet, no onion type of coleslaw.   My husband ordered a side small pancake (still huge) and fried potatoes (note: other reviews refer to hashbrowns. They don't make hashbrowns but do make very thinly sliced fried potatoes). I thought the potatoes were super tasty too.   Now - the infamous pancake: it's massive, made with cinnamon and vanilla and served with homemade maple syrup. I only had a couple bites but thought it was great. My husband doesn't prefer cinnamon or vanilla so he wasn't impressed but he brought home the leftovers and ate them, obviously he still liked them.   Service was excellent, everyone there was friendly and jovial  We will be back and this time I'll order my preferred breakfast - something consisting of eggs, bacon and veggies. Curious to try their \"homemade\" sausage!  Sorry- no pix because we \"dug in\" to the food as soon as it arrived."}
{"text":"I dont know why i havent been here sooner! Every thing that came out of the kitchen looked amazeballs. I was torn between the cowbow skillet. Green chile skillet, blueberry & lemon marscapone pancakes, and the chicken fried chicken. I went with the latter and am proud to say i have no rah-grets. The Chicken Fried Chicken fried chicken had the option of swapping potatoes for biscuits & gravy so needless to say. I SMASHED"}
{"text":"My husband and I checked Yelp for breakfast spots nearby and found Henhouse.  When we arrived, we sighed:  There were tons of people outside, and we figured there would be a one hour wait.  To our delight, we saw that there were lovely family-style picnic benches outside where people were enjoying their breakfast in the winter Arizona sun, and there was only a 20 minute wait.  Once we sat down to eat, I noticed that the service was friendly and on-point, and Henhouse had some nice diner touches (coffee mugs that advertised local businesses, small town antique wall decor) but with fresh food and healthy options. The high ceilings also contributed to the feeling of space and relaxation, and our food was delivered quickly.  On the menu for this foodie with allergies:  Veggie skillet, hold the eggs and tomatoes, add some fresh slicked turkey. Plus, a cup of steel cut oats with both craisins and raisins, hold the sugar. YUM.  The potatoes are thinly sliced and pan-fried, and tasted too fresh to have come from a plastic bag.  Hubby had the two egg plate, and was delighted to learn that the bread came from a local bakery.  Indeed, the thick chunk of rye bread was beautifully marbled - none of that anemic sandwich bread for Henhouse.  So, did we like it?  Yep - we've been twice in the past week, and it's not the last time.  Even better, this time, when I suggested breakfast, it was my husband who suggested Henhouse.  Winner!"}
{"text":"The wait staff needs to manage expectations on wait times better.  Don't say \"it's a 10 minute wait to be seated\" when it's really 30.  Don't say \"your food is coming right out\" only for an additional 20 minutes to go by  Food is decent, if you decide to stick around long enough."}
{"text":"Hostess and Manager refused to add our name on the wait list stating all of the people in our party weren't here...to which we pointed that they are getting children and elderly adults out of the car...you could literally see them getting out of the car through the window...they still refused to take our name even though our entire party was at the establishment...so sorry it takes a little longer for children and elderly adults to get out of the car and walk into the restaurant...I totally understand if we were called to be seated and members of our party were missing or had not arrived yet however this was not the case in our situation...we couldn't even put our name on the wait list until everyone was physically in the actual establishment...hmmmm sounds like discriminatory practices against the elderly, which require more time to get out of a car and walk, and against children who need to be taken out of car seats...I guess if we also had a handicapped individual with us who took a little longer to enter into the place we would still be refused to add our name to a wait list...sounds and smells like discrimination against certain sects of individuals...we will NEVER eat at this \"restaurant\"  again and will spread the word on the incredibly wretched treatment we received...word of mouth speaks volumes"}
{"text":"This has got to be hands down one of the breakfast spots around!  Their gravy is amazing"}
{"text":"This is the first and LAST time our office will be ordering from this restaurant! I called at 11:20am to place an order for our office. They are right across the street from us so we figured this will be a nice change from the other restaurants we normally order from... boy was I WRONG! I was put on hold for 10 minutes when I initially called which was understandable since they are probably busy.... well then they disconnected the call. I called back, was finally able to place the order which was around 11:30am. I was told about 20-25 minutes which was fine because our lunch is at 12pm.... the rep arrived to pick up the order at 12pm... she was told it was going to be another 25 minutes due to 2 orders in front of ours! Why didn't they just tell me that on the phone or call me back to let me know this! Then to top it off... they did not have one of the items we ordered.... So frustrating.... NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Went here once with my husband over the weekend... Be prepared to wait. The food was decent not very big portions unless you ordered the huge pancakes, but I did not have an appetite for that. Kind of crowded and cramped, but good breakfast foods."}
{"text":"The MOST delicious chicken and waffles I've had in a very long time. Incredible syrups and gravy, the crispiest and most tender friend chicken, and YUMMMMMM waffles. We will back again and again and again. So good."}
{"text":"Service was below average. Shock and awe of pancake size is smoke screen for lackluster attention to detail and customer service. Place not that busy so I assume that's why there was a lot of socializing amongst staff and kitchen staff seemed like they had a tough time getting orders right. Tried giving a new place a try but so first time will be my last time here."}
{"text":"We love this place. Consistently good food with an interesting and varied menu. Daily specials for breakfast and lunch. Always busy usually with a wait. The blueberry lemon mascarpone pancake is huge. Comes with house made syrup and is really good. Not too icky sweet. The diablo scramble is great for a spicy start to your day. Flour tortilla scrambled eggs, potatoes, cheese, chorizo, jalapeños, served with re fried beans. Love it. Service is always friendly and these kids hustle. Everything house made. Locally owned which I love to support. Mandy our server was amazing. Busboys never get mentioned.  They are the unsung heros. I have been in the service industry for many years. The last two times we have been here we have noticed Misa. He is extremely efficient. Always busy. You never see him standing around doing nothing. Great employee!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! I ordered the coconut cream French toast and it was super yummy!! You won't be disappointed when you dine here :)"}
{"text":"Yessssssssss. Breakfast/ brunch is the best part of the day and henhouse threw down! So yummy!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was good and our waiter was very professional and friendly. My husband had the chicken fried steak and eggs.  He's pretty picky and said it was tender and lean. My friend had the eggs benedict and as little as she eats, she ate it all. Perfectly poached eggs. I had the green chili eggs. I asked if it was spicy and they assured me it was not. Bummer! The waiter said they could put jalapenos on it to make it spicy but it was still bland. Then they charged me for the jalapenos. Oh well, I'll get something else next time. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Biscuits and gravy were amazing!! Biscuits were the best I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous wait.  No explanation from wait staff.  I don't come to a restaurant to get pissed off.  So I left.    Ok so my partner stayed inside long enough for them to bring the food. And this is what we got. After waiting like 40 minutes. And by the way the people next to us ordered right before us and got their food about 20 minutes prior to us getting ours. All I ordered was a side of potatoes extra crispy. This picture of the potatoes does not do the justice  they are floppy and over-salted. The picture of the other food which is some kind of egg thing and some potatoes also the potatoes were supposed to be extra crispy and they're barely cooked. So because I complained they took our drinks off the bill packaged up the food and sent us on our way. They kept saying we understand we understand the kitchen can't get it together. At one point we looked around and not a single person not a single table had their food. I was feeling pretty good about this place cuz it was busy so I thought this place is going to make it. It's the third different restaurant in this particular building. I'm beginning to wonder if it's cursed."}
{"text":"Bailey was our waiter and he was great! Our food was amazing!! Meatloaf for breakfast!!?  Who would've thought! Pancakes the size of your plate!"}
{"text":"Stopped in a few weeks ago, about 10:30 and despite the crowd outside...was seated as soon as I walked up to the host stand!!  We haven't stopped because we're always put off by the masses...assuming it will be a 30, 60 or 90 minute wait....Ha!!  I had some sort of southwest burrito...FANTASTIC!!  Our server was friendly and attentive.  so....GREAT food...GREAT service......WONDERFUL experience!!  We stopped in  this past Sunday...about 11:30 so we were told a 20 minute wait....NOT BAD....they sat us after 15.  Same server, different meals....still perfect all around!!! My friend had a side of fruit with her pancakes...I was jealous, most places have honeydew & cantaloupe....which I don't eat.  Hers HAD grapes, strawberries and pineapple....YES, please!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! We had a hard time deciding what to order. So many delicious breakfast items to consider. I had the classic Benedict and my son had the breakfast burrito sans eggs. They got the order right the first time. We had zero complaints."}
{"text":"Finally a great breakfast joint! I have lived in Arizona for 5 years now and have only found sub par breakfast places until we discovered this gem. Went on a Saturday morning around 10:30. The place was packed....for obvious reasons. We waited for about an hour (group of 4). It was well worth the wait. Definitely have found our new favorite breakfast place. You gotta order mommas pancake too. Feeds about 6 people easily."}
{"text":"Cold food, bland, no seasoning. Went to both locations and disappointed both times. Long wait times."}
{"text":"A really good new breakfast place that we discovered through Yelp. Pretty big portions and their house made sausage was amazing! We will be coming back a lot more to try more of their menu. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Got top notch service from Sabrina at the bar. Crunchy French toast was awesome, coffee was always full. What I loved was how the staff all helped each other, if it wasn't their table or customer they made sure that the customers experience came first. That's not to common these days, good job guys! I'll be back to try one of those giant pancakes."}
{"text":"Love the food, super service! The place runs like a well oiled machine. Dawn does a super job, love her fun personality!  She actually remembers what we order!  With the volume they get that's unreal!!  See you next Sunday!"}
{"text":"This mornings breakfast was disappointing at best I ordered the hash with corned beef it wasn't bad but the corned beef seemed like it was a pre sliced meat without a lot of flavor the hash itself sported yams as well as potatoes I ordered a side of the Cajun holandase what a disaster it came a globular  mess and cold I ask my wait person if the kitchen could redo it and make it warmer he brought it back in a bigger ramican hotter but the same globular quagulated non holandaise sauce ....nice try"}
{"text":"My new Go To,  breakfast place. Huge portions and wide selection. A down home feel with a bit of a southwestern twist. If you ever wanted to see a pancake the size of a large pizza, this would be the place to do it."}
{"text":"Nice local (to Vintage Ranch) breakfast / lunch restaurant. I had \"The Kitchen Sink\" omelet which was loaded with ham, sausage and bacon. Came with toast and fresh cut potatoes too. A lot of food and tasted great! Looking forward to checking out some other breakfast dishes soon."}
{"text":"Loved my first time visit here for a work birthday breakfast!!    We were a large group and the staff did a great job squeezing us all in.       I had the lemon blueberry pancake with lemon mascarpone on top!     Holy Awesomeness!!     From the first bite it was mouth watering yummy!     My only complaint is that it needed to be cooked a touch longer.   One side wasn't brown at all.    Made me nervous to eat it, but it was luckily cooked enough on the inside so I didn't have to send it back.      Everyone else in our group had good meals too!      I'll definitely be back again!!    Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast and solid staff. Reasonably priced. I prefer first watch, but both are great options."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Loved the lemon blueberry pancake! So fluffy! Also tried the country Benedict- which was also delish! A must try for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place was so good and the service was great.  Visiting from out of town I read reviews and came over.  Yelp did not disappoint."}
{"text":"My wife got an open face meatloaf that comes with eggs, and home cut potatoes with a cheese sauce that was Devine..  it was huge with plenty leftover for a snack for later.  I ordered the green chili pork plate and it was good, I would of loved a little  more spice but then again I'm not at a Mexican food restaurant sooo the spice wasn't a big influence, With that being said, I really enjoyed the dish.  I really enjoy this place, it gets really busy on the weekends so come early"}
{"text":"Food is GREAT  Hostess station/seating is ridiculous.  Our party of three arrived at 8:50am. We were told it would be a 40 minute wait. At 10:00am we checked on the status of the seating and told it would be a few more minutes unless we wanted to sit outside. We requested in doors and said we'd continue to wait even though out 40 minute wait time had surpassed. At 10:25 we were called but seated at a table for 6 instead of three. The people behind us were a party of 7 at a booth for 4.   Our party of 3 look like a*holes to the groups of 5 and 6 waiting in the heat outside."}
{"text":"Tried this location for the 1st time on a very busy Saturday morning. We were sat quickly and although it's small, it's cozy and has fun decór.  I loved their menu - had lots of great options from traditional sweet breakfasts to skillets and omelets, plus their selection of sides was great! I had their oatmeal, eggs and potatoes. Their potatoes were good - remind me a lot of the Farmhouse in downtown Gilbert. My husband had one of the many specials: chorizo omelet with a side of their home-made sausage. It was good. Coffee was great, too. Service was fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Gilbert in my opinion. Prices were good. Service was good. We will be back"}
{"text":"We went for lunch today & we ordered.  We had over an hour wait while others who came in after were be given their food orders.  After an hour 4 of our 7 plates were served.  The food was cold not even warm.  The manager had apologized for the long wait; then to be served cold food.  We got up & told the Manager that the food was cold and we left.  Very disappointing; I don't recommend this place.  It was the worst I have experienced. I had to give it a star rating-it would be a zero."}
{"text":"Olivia was our server and spoke so softly she was hard to hear over the noise of the restaurant.  I had to ask for a coffee refill twice. Olivia never said thank you.  Not impressed with the service and the food was fair."}
{"text":"Was not happy with the food or the service, for one our food took almost forty five minutes from the time we ordered, and the potatoes were under cooked, not a good experience, our waiter wasn't very acomadating"}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero. We arrived at 9:40. We ordered at 10. We didn't get our food until 11. Our food was terrible. I asked for my meal to be taken off. They did. My daughters fruit and my entire meal was even gross looking. I couldn't believed they served it. Look like the scraps from the trash. My husband still paid for 3 meals but decided to not tip. I was walking to our car and heard several customers complaining and everyone was leaving. Not sure what happened today. Never coming back. Surprised they didn't offer anything but an apology. If I didn't have our kids with us I would not have paid for any of the meals. $40 is what we paid."}
{"text":"Great eats! The food is always hot, fresh and the atmosphere has that mom & pop feel that makes you love it right away. But be warned, the \"Moms homemade pancake\" has been know to destroy any who dares challenge it alone! Their crazy huge!  Whatever you order you'll be pleased.  A definite winner!!!"}
{"text":"Service was very good. Food not so much. I had the French Toast. It wasn't cooked all the way through. One side of the bread was not cooked at all.  Don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Despite the 3 star rating my sister talked me into this place because she had tried it a couple times and really liked it. She couldn't figure out how it only had three stars...  Overall the food was good. I really enjoyed the biscuits and chorizo gravy, especially since you could get it with bacon and eggs for a reasonable price. The lemon blueberry marscapone pancake was awesome. The breakfast burrito with green cheese was meh.   Service was lacking. We had Olivia for a server. We spent most of the breakfast waiting for coffee refills and trying to get her attention for one thing if another. And when she did show up she acted like we were inconveniencing her. She was never rude but it was definitely not stellar service.   This place has really good potential if they can just try a little harder."}
{"text":"Always packed and has a family owned feel. The staff is always sweet and the food is home cooking yummy. Great place after church!"}
{"text":"Great local Breakfast place for East Valley Folks.  Service was prompt and friendly and the experience was authentic.  I had so much fun taking my family here.  And of course the Mexican Benedict with a side of bacon was delicious .  Nom Nom Nom..."}
{"text":"We went there on Easter Day.   Before went to   Henhouse I checked on yelp that they open or not.   Yelp advice.  please check with the restaurant because of Easter Day.    I called to the restaurant and reception reply they open until 0230pm AS NORMAL.   So I made appointment with my friend and we got there at 1pm.   We saw they start clean some section. That quite strange.   We walked in side and the girl informed us they closed already!!!   I said how come I just called and you said open as normal.   She replied  \" you just arrived  few minute late\"   We JUST PRINT AND PUT THE SIGN ON   \" CLOSED AT 1 PM\"   Because they gonna have Easter party for themself!!!    Could you believe that ????   So professional !!!!  Now I understand why now they got quite lot of complain from customer.  Anyway may be they think they too busy  and don't care for few customer .  SO LONG.       HEN HOUSE"}
{"text":"Waited about 10 minutes to be seated for 2. They have french vanilla for the coffee. Food took a little too long to come, but the place is packed. The food is good. It cost $25.19 for the two of us. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Had the grandpa skillet, which tasted bland for the most part. The chicken fried chicken was better and had much more flavor to it."}
{"text":"Agreed with some dinners.  Service is below average.  We were there first, but didn't get our orange juice even, for over 20 minutes.  The waiter kept passing by and said sorry, we are behind.  The food came out in a hour.   I would not recommend this to my friends."}
{"text":"Nice local restaurant serving breakfast and lunch. Sorry no cocktails :(  The pancakes were really good and so was the biscuits and gravy.   Still going through some growing pains but I'm sure it will get better."}
{"text":"First time there, and it was delicious. Their homemade sausage patties are divine. The eggs were actually cooked as requested (that's been my biggest gripe about local breakfast spots. The service was great and the atmosphere is cute and clean. I only wish they were able to accommodate requests for smaller pancakes. That was what we wanted, but hate huge pancakes, and these are beyond huge. I guess I just don't understand how they can't make a smaller pancake if that's what you ask for. Other than that breakfast was great."}
{"text":"Walked into restaurant got seated .  Absolutely no greet; Good morning , hello, how are you.. nothing!  Was seated at a dirty sticky table.  That was my cue to leave but my son wanted to try the food, Our first time here.  I asked if our table can be wiped down , after she wiped table it stunk like mildew!   Lost appetite!  My son ordered waffles, eggs , bacon.  He said waffles were not good, eggs were OK, bacon had probably been sitting awhile.  First and last time here."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite breakfast places. You get your money's worth every time, the plates are huge and the pancakes are huge if you're getting that you gotta either have a big appittite or splitting (you have been warned). Biscuits and gravy to die for, the white sausage gravy is so good on top of the warm biscuits."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is top notch and the prices are great! Forget ihop or US egg...enjoy breakfast/brunch here. The lines can be a little long sometimes but always worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes we just tried this new place and have to share.  The Henhouse Cafe is awesome! Diverse with tons on the menu. Specializing in pancakes / French toast and tons of breakfast goodness this is great place for an average price. Better hurry though, They are only open for breakfast and lunch... oh and one more thing. The mama's pancake uses 5 pounds of batter and fills a 24\" pan (and there are 2 of them)... Sammy and the fam had the SMALL one and this little girl was about to get rolled up in the big ones! Lol...."}
{"text":"When I asked the age old question of \"Where are we going for lunch\", today, my coworker said she noticed a new place that had opened up the road.  We had no idea what type of food, just that it was new.  When we drove up, we were pleased to see that they were open and it was a charmingly decorated and homey little place.   We were greeted nicely and told to pick any seat.   They serve breakfast and lunch, and everything looked great.  My coworker chose the BBQ Chicken Salad, and I chose the Mushroom Swiss Burger.  We were very, very pleased with the food, which was delicious.  Service was very friendly.  Prices were totally reasonable.  My giant burger (large, rectangle, freshly made ground beef smothered in swiss and mushrooms, on what tasted like a freshly homemade and butter-toasted bun, with a side salad, a Diet Dr Pepper (and another one put into a to-go cup when we were ready to leave) came to $12.    My coworker and I were lusting each other's lunches (her Chicken Salad was ENORMOUS and mounded with fresh BBQ chicken and long tortilla strips), so we will probably go back next week and order what the other had today."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst dining experience I have ever had. Food was cold, mediocre,  and overpriced.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I really like this place. It's usually busy (good sign at a restaurant). The burritos and pancakes are big, in fact the portions are big in general. Not Claim Jumpers big, but more than enough. I have yet to finish a meal. There is always a take home container in my hand when we leave.  It's home style foods - things you want a breakfast & lunch place to have. Eggs, pancakes, potatoes, pork (bacon, ham, etc.) We sat at the bar last time we were there and were able to interact with the staff. Most were friendly, helpful, and very nice. The kitchen crew was fast and appeared to work well together.  We have been here several times and will continue to come back, as the food is good and the prices are fair. Some of the servers are excellent!!  Recently found out this is 1 of 4 locations."}
{"text":"Always busy, so get there early! My favorite breakfast place! Yes, a little expensive but everything is fresh. From homemade syrup to gravy, to sausage...it's all amazing. If you like chorizo, try their chorizo gravy! It's amazing! Super friendly staff!! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I had the same issues with service today as some other reviewers. It was fairly busy when walked in, but we were greeted and asked to wait a minute for the next table to clear. 10-15 min later after be ignored and seeing our future table vacant for some time, we were finally seated. This was only because a new group of people who came in after nearly got seated there instead and they said something. I had no idea they had kids menus which would've been nice to know since I had my son with me. We didn't know since we had to grab our own menus. We had to ask/wait for utensils.  Finally,  we were given the wrong check. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Our favorite Sunday breakfast spot! The atmosphere is charming and the people are friendly and warm  the food is amazing, and for a really memorable experience, you have to order the Mom's Pancake, it's the size of a XL pizza!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is amazing and portions are big. The staff was courteous and helpful when needed. My only complaint, no options for dairy free coffee drinkers and no gluten-free options. After all isn't this the new norm?"}
{"text":"Great breakfast if you like pancakes the size of your end table and great omelettes. Expect a wait for a seat and food, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place is a must !!! I come here every year I'm in town for six weeks for spring training. I stopped in 3 to 4 times a week. I love their burrito with chorizo . Now for something sweet and delicious strawberry cheesecake French toast is to die for. The coffee is great and I love their biscuit and gravy with high quality bacon. I was greeted with a smile and the service was excellent. My to go place when I'm here in AZ. The owners remember me from the last two years sense I've coming in there. Down-to-earth people"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast restaurant that I have been to in over a year. I come here once a year for spring training and this is the first place I go to. I have to have strawberry cheesecake French toast it's a must !!!  5 + stars. It's in Gilbert and Mesa Arizona if you go to spring training should stop and now great service and great food"}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast place! Of course we still love Blackbear but this place isn't a chain & has great daily specials.  I've tried many different items & loved them all. My husband loves the chicken fried steak w/biscuit & gravy. I love the 1/2 waffle & chicken with egfs! Good stuff! Waitresses are are super nice as is everyone who you encounter."}
{"text":"Food is good, but accommodation sucks! The Manager and hostess told us hen house cafe cannot accommodate big parties of over 7 and up, I watched them give tables to people who just walked in rather than keep the table open for our party of 8+ especially since our party was next on the list. As well as a party of 15 that was given the okay shortly after us. And don't expect your party to sit together....ours didn't on a holiday ment for family gathering. For the long wait and non accommodation, poor table seating planning...it's best to skip this place and move along!  Ps  Also heard the front greeter tell her manager,  \"I give up,  I'm done! I'm done!\""}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the HenHouse Cafe. We have driven by a few times and since we were in the neighborhood this morning it was a great time to stop and have breakfast. We will be back again soon.  I had the Biscuits with Chorizo gravy....All I can say is Yummy.  You get 2 eggs, potatoes and a biscuit covered with this delicious chorizo gravy.  My husband had the Capt N' Crunch French Toast and thought it was some of the best french toast he has had....and that is saying a lot....The bacon was also crispy and tasty...  We will now skip going to OverEasy and head straight to the Henhouse Cafe.....What to try next, ummmmm...."}
{"text":"My son recently moved to Gilbert AZ, and when I was visiting him last week from MI, we decided to try the Henhouse Cafe for brunch. We were NOT disappointed. Went on a Sunday morning around 11:00; had to wait only about 10 min. to get seated. I had the Veggie Fresh Omelet, and my son had the Chicken Fried Steak. Our server was attentive & friendly, the food was delish, and the owner stopped by our table for a nice conversation. We will for sure return on my next visit."}
{"text":"Relaxed family atmosphere. It took a moment for our waitress to ask us for our drink order, once we got our drinks it took a while for her to make her way back to us so we could place our food order. We had to flag someone down to top off our drinks/coffee a couple times. I'll chalk it up to it being Sunday morning. Food was good. We would choose this place again, perhaps on a different day/time."}
{"text":"Best, well priced breakfast around. I wish it were closer. Huge pancakes, but still good. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Really good spot if you're looking for fresh, homemade breakfast dishes. It can get pretty crowded on the weekends, so come early!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and each time gets worse. The first time I got their pancakes which were HUGE! Seriously the biggest pancakes I've ever seen. They were alright and tasted like any old normal pancakes. The second time I got the chorizo breakfast burrito. It was disgusting. I could not eat it. My friends were disappointed with their food as well. I like to support small businesses, but it's hard when their food is disappointing. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great first impression.  Clean, cute and very busy.  The staff is very positive and I was lucky to have Cortney \"Ginger\". Her smile, energy and attention to detail was top self.   The food - I tried the chorizo scramble with a side of French toast. Everything tasted fresh and hot. I will return."}
{"text":"Come prepared for a worthwhile wait for a table.  Friendly diner service.  Casual atmosphere.  HUGE portions.  Breakfast burrito - yum (ask for a box when you order it).  Crab omelet is great with side of fruit.  Who doesn't love orange juice in a Kerr jar?  We have had brunch at all the downtown Gilbert spots.  While we enjoy those eateries, hands down we prefer Hen House!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly, the waitress kept checking up on us to see if we wanted anything.  I ordered the coconut pie french toast and it was delicious.   I was very impressed.  My wife ordered the florentine eggs benedict and they were great as well.  The potatos with it were amazing as well.  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with my daughter and parents.  Food was fantastic, cool decor and it's all recycled items Service was solid everyone was extremely friendly. Will definitely going back."}
{"text":"Hmmmmmm yumm ! This place is worthy of the wait , I got the fried chicken with chorizo biscuits and gravy . Omg to die for ! I also had the hollandaise breakfast sandwich. Love the little vibe it has but I felt rushed to pay and leave"}
{"text":"Awesome place for brunch. Went to Arizona for a funeral and last morning there had brunch. They were extremely nice and food was great."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Gilbert, Az. The people out front waiting to get in on a regular basis should be your first clue. I have to wonder how many of the few negative reviews are competitors or just anal retentive's no ones ever going to make happy. I've literally been here hundreds of times and NEVER had a bad experience! Keep up the Great work Hen House."}
{"text":"Very good food, the pancakes are insanely huge and delicious! Decent price, we got sat quickly, but there were a lot of people waiting on our way out. Service was friendly and efficient. We will be back."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of breakfast places, and I really wanted to give this place 5 stars. They have a great menu with lots of unique items like the Texas Benedict my wife had - delicious! Service was friendly and I enjoyed the atmosphere. There was a long wait like many other reviewers mentioned, not just to get a table, but also after ordering, but that doesn't really bother me as much as I see that as a consequence of being a popular place.  What did bother me are their potatoes. They use the same bland, slightly under-cooked sliced red potatoes with zero seasoning in all their dishes. I got the Grandpa Skillet, and the eggs and stuff on top was delicious, but once I got into the potatoes, honestly it was hard to finish."}
{"text":"We were seated very fast on a Sunday morning, even though they were packed! Breakfast was yummy, a little cold. Orange juice in mason jars was delicious and such a cute idea! My sister got a sprinkle bday pancake, was soooo good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to take our 3 boys out to eat and stumbled across this place on Google and decided to give it a try... we have hands down found our new breakfast joint. My husband is a chef and I am a server at a mom and pop breakfast joint in North phoenix and both of us were completely impressed. Any mistakes were fixed immediately and our server (the check says his name is alfredo?) Showed care and concern and even explained the situation to us without making it seem like he was making excuses. Hands down my husband and I will return...and making breakfast and experience from start to finish!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! But the wait was ridiculous! Waited 45 min for a table, then another 10 or so to give my order. 20+ min later the server tells us that \"ticket times are over 35 minutes because we're training our cooks for the new store today.\" Great for them...is Saturday morning really the best time to train?? We were there for nearly two hours, and she had the nerve to charge me an extra .99 for my kid to get juice refill. Meanwhile the manager is walking around chit chatting with people instead of doing anything productive. So, you're training a bunch of new people and you really feel the best use of your time is to visit with your 'regulars'?  Won't be recommending this location to anyone anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Great little place.  Feels like it should be in the country.  We got sat right away and then greeted right away.  Our server was very attentive.  My husband and I both enjoyed our meals.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"We arrived at opening time.  There were four young women starting their bachelorette morning, and the waitress was attentive to all groups and service was rapid.  There is just one size for orange juices, etc., which was OK, but a larger size would be nice.  My wife had the breakfast sandwich, and the Bacon was done to order, but the egg was over medium instead of hard.  Outside of that, everything was well prepared.  I had a scramble with jalapenos, chorizo, onions, peppers and potatoes with refried beans and a fresh tasting tortilla on the side. It was cooked to perfection.  Our wait staff was excellent, and I believe we'll make this a regular Saturday morning breakfast stop."}
{"text":"Great waitresses. They are informed and very friendly. Quick too! The kitchen is very fast and accurate. Coffee is good too"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  Stopped in to try it out because I love breakfast joints.  Stood at the counter for several minutes with the server standing 5 feet away talking to a vendor of some kind, after a few minutes she looked with her finger up as to say just wait and when I'm done talking to this guy I'll ask you if you want something.  Strangest thing ever.  I walked a couple doors down to New Mexico grill, ordered a breakfast burrito and we eating in 5 minutes.  This place is pretty small so the server saw me, the hostess saw me and the whole kitchen saw me.  Nobody lifted a finger.  Won't ever spend a dime there."}
{"text":"Just had Texas Benedict at the Henhouse! Sweet Cornbread, tender pork carnitas, topped with perfectly poached egg and green chile hollandaise that was to die for! Yummy..."}
{"text":"Yeah...uh...breakfast.  The most boring meal of the day.  What to have?  Eggs.  Toast.  OJ.  Bacon.  Really?  Every day?  Why is breakfast so boring??  No, breakfast is not my favorite meal by a long shot.  And this place really only does breakfast and some limited lunch.  However...a coworker recommended it to me.  Said they do it really well.  And given that my wife really likes breakfast, we'll give it a try.  First, the place is busy.  We've been twice and had to wait both times.  They have a good number of tables and booths, and some outside tables too, but it's still packed a lot of the time.  This is a good sign, really.  Means a lot of people like it.  They have a country decor. Reminds me of diners in the midwest.  Quaint.  The menu ranges from southwest flavor to classic breakfasts.  Not just pancakes (though they have them) but a lemon marscapone pancake.  Omelets of different types, a few types of eggs benedict, some different \"skillets\", as well as \"chicken fried chicken\" and some other similar items.  Last time I ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito, this time I ordered the green chile skillet.  We also ordered the marscapone pancake to share (both visits), and some other items were ordered.  The pancake is a unique flavor.  It's subtle, but distinct.  Very good.  I liked both of my entrees, and did everyone else in our party.  Good sized portions. Simple flavors but good.  Enough different to make breakfast at least a bit less boring.  No service problems, and they give certain groups a 10% discount (veterans, active military, and I think she said emergency responders though I might be wrong on that last one...doesn't hurt to ask if you think you quality).  The servers are running the whole time so you may need to flag one down rather than wait for them to come to you.  But that's minor.  When they do interact they were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"What a menu! It was hard to decide what to order on my first visit and now I want to try everything.  Meatloaf for breakfast? Looks delicious!  Their french toast is made with Hawaiian bread! It was awesome and we also ordered a side pancake to try. It's a meal in itself and very tasty. Looking forward to my next visit. At least 5 other menu items I want to try."}
{"text":"Hygiene alert!! So, Monday morning, super slow kitchen. Waited almost 30 minutes for my food. The meal was fine, and my server was good. My issue is with the hygiene of the staff. Gum chewing, wiping their noses with their fingers and grabbing glasses immediately afterwards. Absolutely gross. Zero hand washing. Coffee mugs were all stained and there was no indication of any manager present. The place is loosely managed with low standards when it comes to appearance, attitude and hygiene. This is my 3rd time here. I don't think I can go back."}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast spot. Everyone was friendly. We especially loved our server Courtney. Food came out fast & was delicious. My only complaint would be that we ordered our 20 month old son 1 scrambled egg with cheese. The egg was $1.49 and the grated cheese on top was $.99. Really!? Lesson learned to not order eggs for him here."}
{"text":"You have to have the meatloaf breakfast! Brought hubby here for his birthday breakfast and it was our first time at the henhouse. We had a wonderful waiter, Cory. All waiters were all smiles. Service was courteous and the food was comforting. Come often! We sure will!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place for breakfast. It shows why they were voted best in Gilbert. The food is plentiful and delicious always. Unique variety of breakfast selections."}
{"text":"Good breakfast, TERRIBLE service. They told us the wait would be 30 min. Waited at least an hour. Finally got seated and I asked to substitute the potatoes for sausage (sausage was only $.20 more. I would've gladly paid the difference) but the waitress was very unaccommodating and refused to make the substitution. She then disappeared after we got our food and was nowhere to be seen! Didn't ever check up on us."}
{"text":"Have Been here a few times,  but this time was horrible. My father walked in, found a seat and the staff knew he was there but chose to discriminate against him and never served him or even brought him a menu. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite place in Gilbert for breakfast. Always seems to be packed but since it's usually just two of us it's not long to be seated, especially if we're willing to sit at the counter. Staff is very friendly. There is usually a wait before the food comes out since it's so busy but I would rather it done right than quickly. I've been several times and have always been extremely happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"Great food from scratch, coffee is excellent staff is fringe and prompt no matter how busy they are. Must try place I go 2 x a week."}
{"text":"My first time to have lunch here.. had the breakfast. Wanted to try the lunch.. meatloaf sandwich is good. The chicken avocado sandwich was killer ! Try that !"}
{"text":"Great experience, staff was friendly and the food was incredible. They serve the largest pancake I've ever seen in my life. The chicken fried steak was fantastic"}
{"text":"This breakfast was so delicious! I was a little skeptical because the wait was long but it was so worth it! Once we were set the service was super fast and efficient! I had the country Benedict and let me tell you it was amazing! The gravy was the best gravy I have every had the egg was just runny enough to be perfect! My boyfriend had a omelette and he finished everything on the plate! Also the breakfast potatoes are to die for!! They are so different than any other breakfast potato that I usually am served at breakfast places! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone just know it may take a little longer if you are a party of five like we were."}
{"text":"It was a little busy when we arrived but were told we could sit as we pleased. We were immidiatly helped and placed our order. After not waiting too long ,our food came out.  The food was all very delicious and different . Definitely  a new favorite breakfast place !"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. 30 dollars got breakfast for me and my ten year old. Took 15 minutes to get waited on once seated and then at the end after we had paid, my kid wanted a cinnamon roll. The cashier did not know how to operate the computerized register and then we waited 15 minutes for our roll. Then when I asked the lady who had our roll boxed up if that was ours, she stopped and said in the rudest voice possible .... No I'm giving it to HER , meaning the cashier. There was no reason not to hand it to us as we obviously had paid for it. Rudest wench ever! It all starts at the top people.... Customer service. Especially when you are brand new and trying to build a business. Between the prices, the wait times, and snotty owner.... Avoid avoid. You'd do much better going down the road to Liberty market. At least You are treated with dignity there. And the food at Liberty kicks this places booty all over the place. Not worth it. I feel sorry for the owners husband. he seems like a nice guy and even HE agreed his wife was off the hook."}
{"text":"The food and service was decent, however they told us that it would be a 25 minute wait and it wound up taking 45 minutes to get seated, and another 45 minutes for us to get our food.  On top of that, we had to wait out in the 100 degree heat because their seating area inside was not adequate for the number of people waiting.  We went on a Sunday morning and it was packed full of people in a very small space.  I believe that the kitchen was too small to handle the amount of people that were in the restaurant.  It was a quaint atmosphere and I enjoyed the Rueben Sandwich and their house salad, however due to the wait, we do not plan on returning any time soon."}
{"text":"I used to traipse all the way to Gilbert for this place. Can't tell you how much I looked forward to this location opening! I can now say with certainty that their service and food is a matter of culture.  If you object to eating something bigger than your face, go elsewhere.  Ask for Courtney!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. Restaurant was busy but we still got in fairly easy.  Food was great, will be back again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and everything that I have tried I have liked. Their pancakes are HUGE!! The blueberry one is probably my favorite one. The green chile skillet is so good!"}
{"text":"I came here for the second time today. Both times, the kitchen has been extremely behind. The kitchen was extremely slow, and did not bring out the food for about an hour. Additionally, they lost our ticket the first time. The only reason I did not give a one star, was because the server was very nice and did his best to help us."}
{"text":"So delicious. We ordered the green chilli scramble, barn buster and the chicken fried steak.  All was very good. I would recommend the green chilli scramble."}
{"text":"I read the mixed reviews, but was still anxious to check this place out for myself. The food and service was seriously the best I've had in a VERY long time! My usual breakfast go-to's are The Good Egg, and small diners around Gilbert. But I have to say - not anymore! I was craving biscuits and gravy in a meaty skillet this morning - mmmm. So worth the extra hour at the gym, haha.   The food was SO FRESH, and bursting with flavor. (I know, I sound like an Applebee's commercial, LOL.) But hey - it's true!  And not to mention I had the sweetest server ever (Caitlyn), who greeted me with smiles every time she came to my table, and was fast and 100% spot on with everything.  I say ditch the other places and make this your new go-to. Job well done, Henhouse Cafe!"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed in this restaurant. It was busy so we sat outside to eat. It took over 1 hour to get our food after we ordered. The general manager came out to talk to us and he was very rude. we were told that server came in and then walked out after 5 minutes and another server didn't show up. That does not give the general manager a reason to be rude to us. I will not go back. The taste of the food is important when you go out but so is the service. The service was terrible. To many other breakfast places that are good that you shouldn't have to put up with the rudeness of general manager."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Henhouse cafe from the first time they opened their doors. Today I entered & exited their doors for the last time, I will never return! Business is booming and they just can't keep up with their success, Quality of food has gone down and the quality of service is even worse! My husband and I were seated and waiting for a server. Three other parties were seated after us and around us. Their servers came by and my husband and I had yet to be acknowleged, after 10 minutes passed we asked a passing server if we could order. Her response, \"I'm not your server.\" She proceeded to walk away. How about, \"I'm not your server but let me go get yours and second, let me get ur drink order.\" When they first opened all servers were there for everybody. Never returning,"}
{"text":"Love this place. The portions are huge and everything tastes so amazing. We usually frequent the location at Higley & Guadalupe but the secret is out. The restaurant is always hopping. We're hoping the location off Val Vista stays a secret for a bit longer."}
{"text":"This place always has always had a wait, but soooo worth it! I have never had anything that wasn't amazing! The service is great and so attentive! Eater beware... the pancakes are no small plate and will likely require a to-go pizza box. This may sound odd for a breakfast joint, but the tamales are a great option and I totally recommend the biscuits and chorizo gravy. Take the family or go alone... just go!"}
{"text":"Worst experince ive ever had at a restaurant.  I arrived for nice sunday breakfast...in all honesty,  i knew it was going to be a bit of a wait cause of the weekend...what i didnt expect was to get passed over for a table on six different occasions.  When we were originally going to be seated the table was not suitable for our party of three, the hostess apologized and told us we would have the next available table. Thinking nothing of it, we stepped back outside and began to notice as group after group who arrived well after us. When we asked the hostess why we were being skipped she told us \"oh no, they were here first\" blatantly lying to us ( we saw them arrive well after we did).  On top of that we experienced horrible service once we were actually seated. 0 out of 5. Worst.place.ever.  otis will never go back"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Food & service were amazing. We went Sunday morning at 9:30 & only had to wait about 10 minutes. Chicken & waffles were awesome. Santa Fe omelet along with their real hash brown potatoes was amazing too!"}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast place. Love the burrito with sour cream. Nice service and great food. Love the giant pancakes."}
{"text":"The food is some what always good but the staff is usually always rude. The one on Higley and Guadalupe is definitely better than this one. So I recommend going there instead of here"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Located in strip mall right next to Cubs spring training facilities. Menu is huge. I got the green chili skillet and it was very tasty. Saw an omelette come by and boy are they large. They have a nitro brewed coffee which was very good. Will definitely be back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The wait time to get in was a little longer than expected (30 mins+-). Our server Nicole wasn't very personable like she was with the other customers. We had to ask several other servers for more to drink and a spoon to stir coffee and napkins ect. The thing that made up for some of the server issues is the food was awesome and we maybe be back for that.  If we do we will avoid Nicole like the plague. She should judge us because were not dress up. Terrible job nicole"}
{"text":"First time here and I have to say it was very nice. The staff was very friendly.   The bacon was crisp, eggs were cooked very well the only things that I would say that needs improvement is the potatoes need seasoning but overall the food was very good. Can't wait to go back and see what they have on the menu for lunch"}
{"text":"Great food, good service made for a very pleasant Mother's day breakfast!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!! Been coming here since they first opened. Always good food and service.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for breakfast early Saturday morning. We decided to sit at the bar since there was a wait .As soon as we sat down our sever came and got our drink order. I originally wanted to come and try there huge pancakes but it was just way to much food for the two of us so instead I ordered the green chili skillet and my husband got the Paul Bunyan. Even though the restaurant was busy our food came out fairly fast and our server was attentive. The green chili skillet was pretty big and it came with a side or tortilla. I love the flavor of the green chili and pork with my eggs. I would recommend to ask for salsa on the side since it doesn't come with it. The Paul Bunyan came with two sausage, 2 bacon, 2 eggs and a small side of French toast.  If you're coming on the weekend with a party of 2 and more, I would definitely come earlier since it does get packed fast."}
{"text":"We've been here 5 times now. This last time was pretty crappy. 45 min wait for a table for 3 people. 10 min wait for a waitress to take our order 45 min wait for our food.  The food was so obviously rushed. Very sloppy on the plate.. My potatoes were complete mush when they are usually crispy.  2 hours spent here and It was not even worth the food. Next time.... Liberty Market ;)"}
{"text":"Had a great time yesterday at the Henhouse.  We had a phenomenal breakfast, I had the chicken fried steak and Heather had the French Toast.  Good lord it was delicious and cooked to perfection!  I think the best part of the day was having a nice chat with the owner.  He's a cool dude with great family values.  You can always judge a man's character by the way he speaks about his wife.  Thanks for the memories Brett!"}
{"text":"I have come here several times and have never been disappointed. The grandpa skillet with salsa is pretty good."}
{"text":"There is always a wait, which is fine. But the service is awful! They are slow and don't know the basic rules of customer service.  We had an order that was bad and sent it back. They didn't even take it off of our bill. I could care less about the $7 but hope it was worth the damage of bad reviews does."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just an off morning for the Cafe. I ordered the special which was turkey Benedict with cheddar. The plate had a nice portion of food, but what was lacking was flavor. My potatoes were raw and the main dish was extremely bland. Someone I went to breakfast with ordered the same thing and they told me that their potatoes were also raw and their comment about the meal was not nearly as nice as mine.  The place was packed and the service was prompt.  I do not know if I would try this place again. It figuratively and literally left a bad taste in my mouth"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this breakfast place every weekend for over 2 months. I am always extremely impressed by the food and the service we receive. Our waitress Erykka(sp?) has an impeccable memory and always provides us with a stress free morning. No matter how busy the restaurant is we never have to wait for anything. The whole team is amazing and helpful. This is my favorite breakfast/lunch stop."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant at Higley and Guadalupe. We came on a Sunday, which usually is packed but still was seated quickly. The server was super friendly and I saw the manager interacting with all of its guests. I ordered the Green Chile omelet and it was sooo delicious and cheesy! My hubby ordered the strawberry cheesecake French toast and he loved it too!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast place in AZ and possibly in the country. The service is always friendly, the food is always on point and the portions are huge. The country boy omelet and country benedict are always favorites. The sausage and bacon here are the bomb and the English muffins they serve are simply unrivaled. This is a can't miss place for the breakfast."}
{"text":"Love my eggs an sausauge, an this place is very welcoming an homely. I love their benedicts they have 6!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at the Henhouse Cafe. The food was amazing. I had the country benedict. It was so filling. Its hard to find biscuits and gravy that good. I can't wait to come back again.  Our server was Dawn. She was a peach!  We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service!!!! Walked in and the AC was broken, our waitress was slow and shouldn't be in the food service. Food was mediocre at best. Don't waste your time or money coming to this place. Whoever the owner is needs to really reconsider owning a cafe, AC was broken yet still had the place open so they could make money while their employees and customers had to suffer in the heat!!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!! I would give is 6 stars if I could. The restaurant was busy but we got seated quick. The server was perfect. Amazing food. Really fun and upbeat atmosphere.  This is our new breakfast stop. Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my experience here yesterday.  Upon being seated we were placed at a very sticky and dirty table and had to ask for it to be washed.  I ordered a fall special menu item, the fall breakfast sandwich which boasted of bacon, fried green tomatoes and grilled sourdough bread.  What I received instead was cold, limp bread still frozen in the middle, fatty ham and regular tomatoes and way too much mayo   When I pointed it out to my server he took my plate away and took the meal off my bill.  However he still charged me for the muffin which wasn't what I ordered either, they were out of the two I preferred.  I was surprised that he didn't offer me a new meal.  I also need to point out he never once checked on us, our water was empty and we kept trying to flag him down so I could let him know about the error.  It was very disappointing because what we did taste was delicious. (The potatoes and the muffin) But a menu item shouldn't be offered with no intention of serving it correctly."}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoyed our meal and we can't wait to come back! I ordered the chicken fried chicken and it was incredible--the breaking was crunchy and the chicken was juicy. Overall the prices were very reasonable and the portion sizes were large! Also, our waiter did a great job and was really friendly."}
{"text":"Quick review...I stopped in for breakfast during lunch and left satisfied.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy, which included potatoes and two eggs. The b&g was tasty but a little small in my opinion. The potatoes and eggs were on point. I added a side of bacon because, well who can argue with bacon.  Service was very good and the establishment was comfortable.  All in all it was a good meal at a decent price."}
{"text":"We were referred to this place by a co-worker who said it was very good.  Drove all the way from Phoenix out to the Gilbert location to check it out.  Upon arrival, we were seated relatively quickly and greeted by our server, Tanner.  Everything from this point on went downhill.  Two of us ordered eggs - scrambled on one, basted on the other.  The wait to get our food was just shy of an hour.  Prior to the food arriving, Tanner returned to the table and asked me if I would accept scrambled eggs as the cooks had prepared my eggs incorrectly.  He told me if I didn't, I'd have to wait even longer.  Keep in mind this is after I repeated my order to him twice and he repeated it back to me.  When I asked him if our skillets would have cheese, he assured me they would.  Food arrived room temperature, potatoes not even cooked all the way and no cheese.  When I asked about the cheese, I was given a plastic cup with cheese in it.  We explained we wouldn't be eating after waiting for an hour only to get the wrong order.  Server asked us for a box and took the entrees off as if he was doing us a big favor.  TERRIBLE service TERRIBLE food TERRIBLE management  Go to TC Eggington's, Broken Yolk or the Original Pancake House."}
{"text":"We got here at 12:54pm and got in right away! We ask our waiter about the best items on the menu, we discussed we don't eat pork, & inquired about the breakfast sandwich with a biscuit egg chicken and cheese and extra crispy potatoes with no gravy because the gravy had pork in it. We also ordered another dish with extra crispy potatoes and a waffle. The waffle came out undone, and when we sent it back to have one made that was done a little golden, they over cooked it. They brought the sandwich and it had gravy on it. We sent it back and it seemed like they Refried the same piece of chicken because it was a thick and dark and so much bread on it that it looked terrible.  They then asks do I want a side of crispy potatoes with my meal that they hadn't cooked the potatoes correctly on, umm I politely said I'd like the potatoes with my meal rather than on the side and my meal tasted real Salty!  They then they bring Hubbys food out and completely forget the biscuit.. for his sandwich..  by this time.. the staff had checked out, half of them  laughing and and ready to be off work, then out of all the places to start sweeping a guy starts sweeping right beside our table... there was a cup that spilled on the floor when we sat down by a waiter cleaning the table, it was all over the floor and no one came to clean it up or even bother to acknowledge it was water everywhere on the floor.. but when he came there with the broom, I was thinking hmmm shouldn't u get that spill over there..  we had to ask for coffee refills and water refills and it just want a great experience!  They attitude was great and they were positive but our food wasn't as good! If I were you I wouldn't go after 12 because they seem ready to go!"}
{"text":"I hate to give this cute place a one star review but I do this for two reasons; the first being bcuz hubby ordered a breakfast burrito that when he took a few bites, discovered mold. Well, he was a trooper and not wanting to complain he discarded the tortilla and ate the insides. When we were through eating I decided the waitress should know anyway, bcuz it's not fair to keep serving moldy tortillas to customers. She apologized and took the tortilla back to the kitchen. She returned and a dollar discount was taken off our check, she stated the bag of tortillas in the kitchen was mold \"free\" and didn't understand how his was the only one. Anyway mistakes happen in any business and the recovery is paramount to earning loyal patrons. Sadly this place did not earn my return revenue. They could have handled the situation much better and had lifers! The food I ordered was fine and the servers are very nice I wish the owner or manager had been more savvy in customer service. :-("}
{"text":"Absolutely worth the wait ! The restaurant had great atmosphere and even better food. Our server Shelly was wonderful even with a packed restaurant we got impeccable service. We ordered the chicken and waffles and the strawberry cheesecake French toast and shared. The spicy syrup was delicious and the French toast though I thought it would be way too sweet was perfect. Large amounts of food for good prices, we will make the trip again to eat here and will be a regular stop for brining guests we pick up from the airport."}
{"text":"So I rarely venture out to the burbs that start with a letter G. But when your preggo bestie wants pancakes, you make the drive.  Let me tell you, glad I did! Naturally, the wait was a little long on a Sunday morning - but that's just brunch. While we waited, we were offered water and got to peruse the menu. We also got to observe meals being served in the restaurant. and let me tell you, the pancake that boasts being large and in charge is not messing around.  I had the chicken and waffle (DELISH!) and my bestie got a short stack which she had a tough time finishing mainly because they were huge and delicious and apparently you have to leave room for a baby in your stomach when you're pregnant and can't just eat all of the pancakes (bummer).  On top of that - we got the bill and it was CHEAP. Granted I may be jaded into thinking booze is a normal expense at breakfast, but it still seemed VERY reasonable across the entire menu."}
{"text":"Love this local breakfast joint! The boyfriend and I try to go every other week, he was skeptical with trying this place at first with some of the reviews, but ive gone without him before and love it! Their French toast or any sort is delicious and filling, although i would love more custard over them ;) their sink omelet was great as well.. But i will have to say i am not a big fan of their grandpas skillet ( i believe thats the name of it) too many potatoes, not enough sauce or other ingredients, it seemed rushed and used more potatoes as a filler.. But other than that, manager/owner walks around and says hello and makes sure everything is excellent and is involved, friendly staff, we get the same girl everytime, never introduced herself though so she's nameless, but great place, great food, great location!"}
{"text":"My husband really enjoyed the chicken fried chicken & it was a large portion. I ordered blueberry pancakes. Most people would be thrilled that it was so large it looked like a pizza but I found it to be dry & did not have enough blueberries. My husband is looking forward to going back but I am not sure if I would want to give it another try."}
{"text":"Good find for breakfast. They have great coffee and we had great service.   The homemade sausage is a must. We got a mix of breakfast food from Coconut vanilla bean dipped French toast to chicken fried chicken.  The pancakes are HUGE and very delicious.    Would give it another try!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! We have gotten the chicken fried steak as well as the waffles. Everything is good! We went to Henhouse for Mother's Day and had excellent service and they even brought me a special desert! This place is great!!"}
{"text":"Have been to the Henhouse Cafe twice now, most recently on Mother's Day, and it has been wonderful both times. The strawberry cheesecake french toast is AH-mazing! The family that owns the restaurant is very nice and very helpful. I have allergies to chocolate, peanuts and tree nuts and the owner came out front from the kitchen and she made sure that we both knew about what my allergies were and what I could and couldn't have. She was awesome!   It's a cute place inside. Nicely lit with natural light and good size. Not too big, not too small.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have only gone here for breakfast. SE Chandler needed a good morning chow spot, and this place fits the bill. Always great food and service. Nice variety from sweet to savory offerings. If you are in the mood for a hearty breakfast to start your day, look no further."}
{"text":"Still sitting in the booth after a great breakfast of chicken fried steak. We have deemed this our new breakfast place"}
{"text":"Huge portions. Encourage a hungry person (or a whole family) to take down the full sized pancake. Or get it to go in a large pizza box! No gluten free bread. Exceptionally competent friendly service. Pleasant dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"Santa Fe omelette was great although charged an extra $1 to swap bacon for the sausage (btw - both meats cost the same on their menu) and $.50 to get salsa with a Santa Fe omelette!  Ordered side of corned beef hash. Way too salty!  No potatoes or onions in it. Just fried corned beef. Little weird. My friend had Chorizo scramble. Eggs separate from the chorizo on the plate. She said chorizo was very good!  Charged her extra $.50 for onions. Liked the charm of the place and we both liked our meals, just felt like they nickel and dimed us to death!  I thought the table was sticky and asked waitress to wipe it down. She said she would but never did.  I would give them a so-so rating."}
{"text":"Myself and two friends  went to the Gilbert location Wednesday.   It was very disappointing  since I've been a customer there previously. The restaurant wasn't that busy but it took an extended period time for someone to offer a drink and take our order  and even acknowledge us. Our server  walk by several times apologizing for the wait.  I believe it was over 20 minutes before Only 2 of us got our food  My order came out last the eggs were cold as well as the potatoes"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's nice to have a non-chain restaurant in the neighborhood. The place can be busy (but what Breakfast place isn't?) so you can wait. But the service is fast and friendly. It does have the family service feel and the wait staff don't treat you like a number.   The waitresses are always quick to refill the coffee and check back that the food is okay. I like it though the biscuit was a bit bland/dry for me but I've only had it once. The omelets and home fries are great! The coffee is better than most breakfast places - so why have those little sealed cups of creamer? The only thing that I don't like. If you got good coffee, it deserves some real cream. But other than that - all is great.   I think for a good breakfast served up by friendly people - you can't go wrong with Henhouse Cafe."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place here in Gilbert. Customer service was awesome. They knew their stuff and were pretty quick. I ordered moms pancakes. They say they are big, but I didn't believe them. I mean, they were only $8. They couldn't be that big, right? Let me tell you, they were serious. It comes with two pancakes the size of a pizza. In fact, they give you a pizza box to take home your leftovers. They are so big that you should have your picture taken if you finish them. I will be back and order something a little smaller next time. Great little find."}
{"text":"Came here on a week day and it was fairly busy. We sat ourselves and it took a little while for a server to come and greet us but after that the service was good. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros it has a weird after taste that's why I have a 3 star because I'm sketchy about the quality. I was expecting home made food coming in and it kinda tasted like it had jarred salsa that contained vinegar. My dad had an omelette and enjoyed it. I'd come back to try something else."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food, big portions, and reasonable prices...easily sums it up!  Our server Mike was on top of things and very courteous.  The cinnamon rooks are amazing!!"}
{"text":"We try a new breakfast spot every Monday, & the henhouse did not disappoint! Loved the chorizo burrito, green chili skillet & the pancake was only $3 and the size of a large pizza! Great service & speedy!"}
{"text":"Great food, okay interior, okay service. We got the french toast and absolutely loved it, did not love the service, could be improved. We also got sat behind a wall and it wasnt ideal. Take down that stupid wall and leave the whole area open."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Amazing customer service which is key in an industry! Prompt, yummy and fresh!  The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The food is fresh, very delicious, my favorite is the French toast, but everything I've gotten there is delicious.   The restaurant is clean and well decorated! I love how they tied in the decor at all their locations. The atmosphere is nice and calming. They do get very busy on usual breakfast rush days... Saturday and Sunday! But it is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Judging on food alone, I would give this place a 3.5 or even a 4 on a good day. Unfortunately, the service standard leaves much to be desire and is riddled with what I would deem \"rookie mistakes.\" Once seated, the wait time has been way longer than expected at every visit. With two hungry kids in tow, my husband and I opted for an order of the muffin tops they advertise to keep my 2 yo from gnawing off his arm and devouring the jelly packets. We let the waiter know as much.... but unfortunately, a half hour in, not only were we no closer to getting our meals but the waiter had completely forgotten the muffin tops. Another time, the same thing happened with an order of biscuits. On another occasion, when attempting to call in a phone order, I was hung up on 3 times and then placed on a 15 minute hold before hanging up. When I got to the restaurant to order in person and told the hostess and waitstaff, all they could say was \"ya we are busy...I don't even know where that cordless phone went.\" No apologies... just disorganization. While I am super excited that this family run place opened in the neighborhood and agree with other yelpers that the food and portions are promising, they are going to have to figure out a way to manage their service deficiencies proactively... if you know it's always gonna be a 45 minute wait to sit, and another 45 to serve food... start handing out free finger foods in the lobby and giving a basket of biscuits or muffins at the table. At some point, if they don't figure it out, folks will start migrating to the New Mexican place next door (really great food with none of their issues)... in the long run, the pancakes simply aren't good enough to deal with the sloppiness elsewhere."}
{"text":"I would have to say that the food I ordered was phenomenal.  My girlfriend referred me to this place and I must say what a great choice!  The Setting & atmosphere and the people who work there are really great  especially the server named Bailey. He was kind courteous and prompt and made us feel at home.  I ordered the Pual Bunyan breakfast platter and it was outstanding. The best breakfast I've ever had and I like how they make their own sausage.  I was very impressed and I will definitely be a returning customer!  :)"}
{"text":"Still 5 stars, just another update as today we met the wonderful owners- great people with a great work ethic on serving real food. I couldn't love this place any more than I already do!"}
{"text":"The food is so fresh and homemade, yummy! Friendly staff, great food and a comfortable environment. Win win win!"}
{"text":"The staff here is incredible!  The food is great, but seasoned to perfection by a friendly and attentive buzz of black shirts."}
{"text":"Terrible experience!  My husband and I ordered at the same time but my ticket wasn't put in to cook until after his food came out. They said my food was coming out very shortly. Also only part of his meal came out. I told him to go ahead and start eating because no sense in letting his food get cold. I kept waiting and waiting. No one gave us an update. He finished and a busboy took his dishes away. Still no meal. Finally, after waiting a long time, my meal came out along with the rest of my husband's. No apology, just blamed it on the computer. I asked if they were going to discount our meal. The manager came out and confirmed for us that it was the computer messing up. No discount. No apology. And they overcharged us for my husbands meal and argued about it. We checked a menu on the way out and we were correct but too pissed to care. Awful customer service!"}
{"text":"Poor service and bad food. Our server must have been high. My husband said over hard eggs our server wrote on ticket poached hard.  He forgot my sons egg order and had to come back out 15minutes AFTER taking our order to ask how he wanted them.  When we returned  the poached eggs and asked for what we ordered (over hard) he brought us partially scrambled eggs AND set the plate ON TOP of my husbands dirty plate.  Who does that!?!?!? Instead of bringing us another glass of iced tea he brought us a glass of ICE.  Just ICE.  The potatoes are boiled, sliced and then pan fried and you can taste it.   Way to expensive to have such bad food and such poor service.  First and last time we will be here."}
{"text":"I have no idea why people rave about this place.  Perhaps breakfast is good but the sandwiches and wraps are mediocre and the green chili soup was made with pickles!  When we told the waiter he just shrugged his shoulders.  The Rueben had very little meat on it and though I told the waiter to go lightly on the ranch dressing on my wrap, it was dripping all over.  Very bad experience."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place! Employees are super friendly. Food is great. Haven't tried the BIG pancake plate but one day looking forward to that! Brought friends over to this place and now it has become one of their favorite go to places for breakfast! Super filling! Will try the lunch menu one day!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  The Texas Benedict was Fantastic. Carnitas, green chili and poached eggs with tasty Hollandaise over amazing cornbread.  Nothing like it!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast and brunch spot. Never have to wait longer than 10-15 minutes to be seated despite how busy they may look. Crunchy French toast is a must :)"}
{"text":"Huge portions, come hungry. Highly recommended the breakfast meatloaf, chorizo burrito or if you're brave enough; the HH breakfast sandwich. Great menu and atmosphere. Pro tip: get your potatoes crispy."}
{"text":"Sausage is fresh, delicious not oily at all.  Green chili skillet is so yummy, potatoes, green chili, eggs and shredded pork!  First time there was Friday, craving it next day and had to go back.  Service is great too! Met owner and he is a cool dude. So happy for Yelp to have guided us there. Will be back no doubt!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Super friendly staff. Food was made very well of high quality ingredients.   Unfortunately all of the food was under seasoned. Their wonderful scratch made sausage was very plain, the potatoes were not seasoned at all.   They are close to 5 stars, bust it the seasoning!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast spot and very reasonable prices. You might wait 20 min, but it will be worth it. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting friends here and decided to stop by here for breakfast.  Service was friendly and quick, and THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS!!! Came here on a Sunday morning, and of course expected it to be busy, but the wait wasn't that bad - 20 minutes for a party of three.  Our server, Branden, was very friendly and attentive.  Made sure to check in on us multiple times throughout our meal.  My husband had the Chicken Fried Steak, our friend had a breakfast burrito, and I ordered the Paul Bunyan with a side of fruit.  Everything was amazingly good!! Will definitely be coming back when we are in town again."}
{"text":"Love the Hen House! This place is always packed. They have good prices & good food! Their ginormous chocolate chip pancake is fun! Their meatloaf is Yum too! So many good dishes, haven't had anything I didn't like yet and I'm a picky eater."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and good food. The theme is good and the food came out quickly. Definitely coming back. Maya was our waitress"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in town.  Excellent home town atmosphere, and food.  Wait staff is always excellent - friendly and attentive.  Coffee is excellent - extra points for having Coke products!  Huge portions.  Kitchen Sink omlette was specular.  Homemade sausage is awesome."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that Henhouse switched to Pepsi.  Places are doing this to save money. Would be interesting to see how sales are impacted.  I ordered water instead.  Will most likely not stop here for breakfast as much. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Felt like they didn't want my business. Yes I have children but if you can't accommodate a simple high chair, then I will take my business to another small business. What a joke. Walked out and went down the street to give my $90 breakfast dollars. Next week's $240 bill will be elsewhere and every month for now on.  Have a large business and my colleagues and I will not be coming by anymore. Have the owner reach out to me. I doubt it will ever happen.  A HIGH CHAIR? FAMILY. KIDS. AVOID!!!"}
{"text":"Come here with an appetite! All their portions are good size and they dont fall short on taste or service"}
{"text":"I just recently visited Henhouse cafe and found it deserving of a Yelp review. I find breakfast joints to be hit and miss. Well, Henhouse was a hit after several misses in the past. Let me tell you about my experience.   I went for a late breakfast and there was nobody there to great us, not a big deal. Perhaps just place a sign up that welcomes guests and tells them to seat themselves. Makes the restaurant more inviting in my opinion. The staff was friendly and the service was great. She kept my water filled and the small things are appreciated.   As for the food, I found everything to be delicious! I ordered the Kitchen Sink omelette. My friend also ordered the same and her brother had the country fried chicken which looked mouth-watering. I didn't care for mushrooms and they let me substitute green chiles, yum! It had bacon, ham, sausage, cheese, onions, peppers and perhaps another ingredient I can't remember. The omelette was pretty impressive as for as size was concerned. It came with potatoes on the side and a selection of toast. I mixed the potatoes with the omelette and put several splashes of the green Tabasco on top. Explosion of flavor and I consumed every last bite despite lingering pain of a full belly. It was the kind of meal that you lean back in your chair and pat your stomach while you pick food out of your teeth with a toothpick. I'll definitely be back to try other things on the menu and it's only a mile down the street!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here for the first time and we were So impressed with their food! It was delicious and decently price for the amount of food you get.my daughter LOVED her kids pancake and the size of it.. she's been asking Every day to go back for the big yummy pancake!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with my family. The waitress was very quick to take our order and refilled our drinks in a flash. I ordered the club and the sandwich was huge. This place is always packed when we drive by -- and for good reasons. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Great locally owned breakfast joint. Food is thoughtful and staff is friendly and helpful. Not only was the owner interacting with customers to see how everyone was doing, he was also bussing tables! Coffee an OJ prices were a bit steep. They won't keep us away but might be enough to prevent some people from returning."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great ambiance! Service was spot on and will definitely return again."}
{"text":"My family & I go whenever we can. We love it. Great sausage & sausage gravy. Wait staff & family that runs it are great. My only knock is the Coffee. Upgrade the coffee!!! If I'm only one, then keep & to hell with me. Everything else is amazing. Thank you for having the old school family corner breakfast place."}
{"text":"Just saw Henhouse Cafe  when driving by this morning so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was good.  Didn't love the bacon and especially the sausage but eggs and pancakes were good.  Syrup was a little too sweet for me (I know...it's syrup) but flavor was good.  There was quite a few people in there but were able to seat me quickly...it'll take it."}
{"text":"We came a party of 8 and sat down at an open table outside on a Wednesday morning while it was relatively slow. We were waiting and waiting and our kids were beginning to become restless . I walked inside and nicely asked if anyone was serving the patio and the older lady at the hostess station replied I told the waitress not to go out you have to come in and check in with me first! We don't serve u until u check in !! Wow scolded your paying customers not checking in when u can clearly see them sitting on your patio and not greeting your customers!!! Shame on you Henhouse!!! You have lost us as customers we will be going to the olive mill or snooze where they know how to treat customers!!!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here this morning let me tell you the food is great. I had the barn buster 3 eggs cook perfectly two thick pieces of bacon, two home made sausage patties mini burger size, and a chunk of ham that was half the size of the plate with fried red potatoes and toast only ate half the food another days breakfast to take home. We also had the corned beef and eggs best corned beef we have had in a while at first with the sweet potato instead of regular potatoes I didn't think it would be good I was wrong it was delicious. We also had the chicken fried steak also spot on. The service was great we were seated promptly even tho the place was hopping at 8 am on a Saturday morning give them a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were skeptical about eating here due to the poor reviews about service and we walked by a couple of times before we went in. The day we went in there was no waiting. Mitchell was our server and this review is as much for him as the food which was very good. We split the chicken and waffles, chicken fried chicken on top of a traditional waffle. My husband also ordered two eggs over medium. The chicken was tender, moist and seasoned very well, the waffle was perfect as were the eggs. Mitchell was fast, efficient and quick witted. He brought us extras that we really enjoyed. Our food came within 15 minutes of ordering. If you visit this place go on a day when they aren't busy. That's what we will do, and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly and fast service. First time for my hubby and second for me.  Both has the chorizo biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"My family and I arrived at 9 AM, checked in and were told 25-30 minute wait. After 45 minutes of waiting, I went back to ask if they knew how much longer. The hostess said 15 more minutes so we decided to wait since we had already waited 45 minutes. For some reason, parties of 5 kept getting called to be seated in a 6 top tables. After an hour, my husband went inside to ask again how much longer. The hostess told him that they were still waiting for a table to accommodate our party of six then decided to say that they had already called our party, we just didn't come up when called. I was sitting right next to the front door for almost an hour! And had even checked with the hostess that my name hadn't been called and maybe I missed it; she confirmed that I hadn't. After an hour and 15 minutes, we told them never mind, we were leaving. Neither hostess was apologetic and just kind of shrugged us off. My husband and I were embarrassed for suggesting this place for my brother's birthday breakfast and wish we hadn't wasted our time or our family's."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and great staff!  Riley and Amanda are awesome, and they never let our coffees go below half full.  The owners are a nice couple who run an incredible staff.  My wife and I have been coming to Henhouse since shortly after it opened.  The chorizo omelette and the green chili omelette are delicious.  The cinnamon rolls are a yummy, occasional treat.  Saturdays and Sundays, the place gets packed, but that's good problem to have."}
{"text":"Hoped to try.  Waited too long.  Means kitchen is slow.  Waited 15 min and sat only 2 new tables.  Lots of people leaving but new parties coming in.  Maybe will try again during a week day."}
{"text":"Pancakes are huge! They were right. But I ordered the classic Benedict which satisfied me. Couldn't help staring at the food across from me. This place has my attention."}
{"text":"Great food and environment. I questioned coming here at first because of some of the reviews.  People who leave negative Yelp reviews after only one visit should not be entertained. They hate their miserable lives already."}
{"text":"This morning my husband and I had breakfast at the Henhouse cafe. They bring so much food so we re used to share. We ordered the chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy substitute. I asked for the gravy on the side. This was all good, but they did not bring out enough gravy. The waitress brought out another small amount of gravy which was great until the bill came. She had charged an extra $1.99 for the gravy. If I had not,asked for it on the side our food would have been swimming in gravy without any extra charge. If course I said something and she removed the charge. Also, they charged $2.85 for my husband to have coffee. Wow that is crazy expensive. The food was great, but I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Good food. Definitely recommend giving it a try. I had the eggs Benedict. Super yummy."}
{"text":"God... I'm sorry to read the reviews on this place.......MOE it started out so good what happen? They do have great people working there, I go there and it's standing room only. I was there when they first opened up.  Moe & Eric its not the bar. PLEASE get it together. Breakfast, Breakfast, Breakfast.. You guys personalty's are great."}
{"text":"My son and daughter in law took me here as Im visiting from California. The worst service ever and the food did not come out together and people who came after we did got their food before us. Didn't care for it at all. Cold coffee is a NO NO."}
{"text":"This place came recommended by FB friends but was just mediocre at best.  The staff was unfamiliar with allergens in ingredients and unwilling to make simple menu substitutions even for kids with allergies.  The omelets had processed cheese dumped on top and no flavor.  The waitstaff was curt, the bathrooms didn't lock properly, and nothing about the food was remarkable.  On the plus side, the decor was cute and sunny and the coffee was left on the table for you to help yourself."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Seeing all my friends rave about this place and this place was just ok. Service was spotty and my cali Benedict was slightly bland. Their saving grace is the syrup that comes with the pancake. Both my husband and I felt this place gets a 3 star rating. We won't go out of our way to come back."}
{"text":"Homemade CornBeef Hash is OMG... Good!!! The pancakes are not for the tiny eaters, they are made to be shared!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place! Food and service is great, decor is original and cute. I had French Toast, my husband had biscuits and gravy breakfast. Will definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"My husband orders the chicken and waffles and it is great every time. Try it with spicy syrup,  yum!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Wish they were open all day! Our waitress was super nice. Get the Texas eggs benedict"}
{"text":"Typical greasy, heavy comfort breakfast.  Had to wait, won't do that again as it wasn't really worth it.  Prices were decent and service was pretty good."}
{"text":"The wait was extremely long, she said 30-35 and it was 45-50 minutes then another 30 before we got our food. Food was very good; pancakes so large they give pizza boxes to-go. Pricing is average for breakfast place, my husband is allergic to eggs and they don't let you substitute anything. Will never come with the kids again on a weekend morning, just takes way too long to be seated and served."}
{"text":"Went here last Sunday for the first time based on the Yelp reviews. I will say that this will probably be our new go-to breakfast place every Sunday with the family. The service was great, we were seated within 20 minutes on a busy Sunday morning. Mike was our server and he was absolutely wonderful. Very charming! He checked on us often & made us laugh with good conversation. :) Now on to the food.... Soooo good!!! We ordered a short stack of pancakes that between the three of us it didn't even look like we put a dent into it (they are massive- and for $8 bucks that's a steal!) I also had to get a homemade cinnamon roll because they are my favorite & I read that they sell out pretty quickly! You could tell it was homemade because the frosting was very sweet, it was more of a decadent dessert type cinnamon roll but nonetheless, very good! My mom ordered the chorizo biscuits and gravy, also something I recommend! Overall it was a wonderful experience, and we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast joint in the East Valley! I love the food, service, and warm atmosphere! Most weekends they are very busy and you will have to wait for a table. However, you're in for a treat if you're looking for a hearty and tasty breakfast. The portions are sizable and the food is outstanding. My favorites are the \"Morning Meatloaf\" (Heaven sent) and the \"Country Fried Chicken\" (god sent). If you're looking to grab breakfast in Gilbert I would highly recommend The Henhouse Cafe!"}
{"text":"One star is overrated. Hostesses appeared as if they just crawled out of bed. Restaurant Cleanliness is poor. Walked out, would not take a chance on eating here. Never again."}
{"text":"Delicious, reasonably priced, great service. We sat outside on bench table and weather was perfect, coffee was delicious, and enjoyed a great birthday breakfast. Definitely will be back to try the chorizo biscuits and gravy!"}
{"text":"Spur of the moment stop after noticing their signage from the nearby main intersection.  Went out on a limb and tried some interesting mixes for breakfast.  They also had specials which I was torn between. Did not notice any of the lackluster attention to detail or substandard customer service listed elsewhere.  My wife and I had a delicious meal and will return when in the area."}
{"text":"The food was really good, my girlfriend and I split the the French toast which was delicious. Our waiter, who now that I think about it didn't even introduce himself to us, came off a little rude. He came to get our drink order in, and I asked for a price of the coffee since their menu didn't have any drinks listed at all, his response was \"I Don't Know, Man\" . Also the Patio had flys galore. Do not sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Burgers are phenomenal! i was going to try the cheese steak, but instead went with a burger & i'm glad i did!! place was super busy, but waitresses were attentive & did a great job on tending to everyone! This is my first time here & my second ever review, so just considering i took the time to write this means it was that good. Definitely cost friendly & good food :)"}
{"text":"Horrible service for second time. Wish I didn't even do a one star. I wasn't allowed to take in my water bottle and had to put it outside. Owners were unprofessional with crude sarcasm with cussing, which they thought was cool I guess. Staff was unwelcoming and our table was ignored for more then 10 min with eye contact. I never complain or do reviews but this is how bad my experience was. The owners need an etiquette class on how to treat staff and humans beings. Felt like I was in a tattoo parlor or barber shop, not a cozy hen house. Food was awful too."}
{"text":"Love this cute little place! Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, so any place that caters to my love for eggs and waffles makes my heart happy. I liked this place so much that I went twice during a five day trip to Phoenix.  The service here is beyond friendly. They are so welcoming from the moment you walk in the door and from what I saw, they know all the regulars and even remember their orders. I love that! It feels like you are being welcomed by good friends or family. I definitely recommend the chorizo and the spinach and chicken omelette."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict was the worst I've ever had. The eggs were so over cooked they were practically hard boiled. The avocado was underripe and some of the potatoes weren't cooked. Service was ok, but they need to figure out a more efficient way to manage to-go orders that doesn't leave guests standing awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Today was the last day my Son and I will be having breakfast at this place.  Thank you for the last year of good food, conversation, and environment.  However over the last four months things have changed.  Always out of items (raisin toast) and poor quality of other items (like fruit, bread quality, etc).  Even the pancakes have gone downhill.  The owners seem like decent people.  But they just lost a regular.  I can't imagine I am the only ....."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Honestly, be prepared to spend a long time here. That's both good and bad for the business. It shows that the food is good...unfortunately it doesn't translate well when you have kids. Ticket times averaging 35 on the weekend (per manager) plus wait time and seated wait time are hard for breakfast foods.   Our particular visit included a long wait time and then a very long wait time for food. The server was friendly but after putting our order in disappeared. The manager approached us, not vice versa, when she kept noticing we didn't have our food. We mentioned that our server disappeared too. Shortly after, our food came and as they were putting the toast down I noticed a hair on the toast....they immediately took back and told me it was a butter brush and not hair. I believe them, it very well could have been but it's just not something I would know to inspect and eat.  At this point, the manager said I want you to come back and try our kitchen. We have new cooks and we are just getting going. We said no, we don't want a free meal. She was very nice. But in this same time period, she must have talked to the server because the server then continued to avoid and didn't check on us again and we had to get up and ask for napkins, butter, etc.  We even said to the manager, we understand it's out of her control...I hope she's not upset. She went from avoiding us to slamming dishes at the table next to us, etc. My husband had to get her attention to break change and she said \"when I'm done\"...she was bussing a table.   The food was really good, the manager was very nice, my lower stars reflect this servers attitude and I think she would retaliate if we went back! I'll try the other location!"}
{"text":"Good food a few more options would be great, but has awesome hospitality and a great owner who noticed I was new and made a point to make sure I was satisfied. Can't wait to try some of the vanilla bean and ice cream combos on waffles and pancakes. Make sure if you order anything you would use salsa on to ask for the homemade salsa or the green chili sauce which are great. (Not spicy but good flavor)"}
{"text":"The food was good, nice atmosphere, the waitress was very friendly, attentive, and cater to our needs(more coffee).  Food came out very quickly, hot, fresh, just the way we like it."}
{"text":"So yummy. My go to brunch spot for a good old American breakfast experience. While you're there make sure to try the eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"The owner is one of the best cooks I know, great business sense. Her hubby is the personality of the place and a down home great place."}
{"text":"I am a HUUUGE fan of their Chicken Fried Chicken. I substitute the biscuits and gravy for the toast and sometimes get the chorizo gravy instead of the traditional. This usually leaves me enough food to take home and have another meal."}
{"text":"Excellent pancakes. Blueberry ones are very fluffy and huge and they aren't even the big ones. Also great potatoes. It is crowded on Sunday mornings but worth a short wait. Strawberry cheesecake French toast also above average."}
{"text":"This place is very tasty and has an expansive breakfast menu.   The buttermilk pancakes are huge, tasty, and super light and fluffy. The green chile skillet is delicious as well! It's served in a cute bowl, layered with potatoes, shredded carnitas, green chili sauce, eggs cooked to order, and cheese with a tortilla on the side.   The only negative thing I have to mention is how long the wait is on weekends, especially in regards to how long the food takes to come out once you order. Slow. Slow. SLOW."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I ever had!  Owner came over and thanked us.  What a great guy!  Everyone is so friendly there."}
{"text":"I can't believe we have never been here! We got the chicken fried steak, a single pancake, and the strawberry cheesecake French toast. Oh my goodness. It's hard to find good chicken fried steak that isn't dried out or tough. This melted in my mouth.  My husband has dreams about the French Toast.  The pancake has a perfecct buttermilk flavor. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The pancakes are huge, and pretty tasty. My wife and I come here on a regular basis,and I don't think we've been disappointed with anything we've ordered."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great little place. Sunday Funday we just look on yelp for new places. So glad we stumbled on this place. Very cute and quaint. Portions are extra large.  Our server Nikki was AH-MAZ-ING!!!!! Will be back. Great start to the day. I'm full"}
{"text":"Came in on a early morning on a Wednesday and wasn't a great experience. We walked in and were guided to sit at a booth. We sat there for 15 minutes before we were greeted by our server, even though there was plenty of servers and people surrounding us. As we sat there, there were 40 plus flies surrounding us. I can understand a couple of flies, but come on everywhere... Definitely not going back for the not so great breakfast."}
{"text":"Waited for 45 minutes for this sandwich. Really? Why? This place wasn't even busy! Watched two groups of people sit down get food and leave before I I even saw this damn thing."}
{"text":"My family and I were very hopeful that this place was going to be amazing.  We went for my father's birthday and were greatly disappointed in the service.  About 30 minutes after we ordered we noticed that the waitress had looked at our table and had a look of confusion on her face.  We figured this meant that she forgot to put our order in but thought \"oh well, now our order should be in\".  There were many tables of people who had arrived after us and had received their orders pretty quickly.  After waiting about another 45 minutes she came over and apologized that we had not yet receive our meal.  She informed us that we would have 25% taken off of our bill and gave us $2 in coupons (which was more offensive than the 1+ hour wait).  Finally we received our food.  Unfortunately we were not able to tell if it was good or not because it had clearly been sitting for awhile and was cold.  At that point we all just decided to leave.  We would have been more empathetic if the place was jam packed but it wasn't and with the length of the wait there were less and less people to wait on.  It was the worst dining experience I have ever had especially since we had such high hopes."}
{"text":"Happy to say this would be the breakfast place if we were per minute Chandler Gilbert residence. Hopefully at some point in time though role in the Scottsdale Arizona. Food yummy, service awesome, outside dining excellent!"}
{"text":"Mandy is an awesome server!  This place is always packed, so it is wise to expect a 20 minute wait (amazingly, my friend and I sat immediately today at 10am, so you could get lucky).  Huge fan of the California Crab Omelette, so you really have to try it if you're inclined to seafood and hungry.  My best friend Tedy is partial to Eggs Benedict; also delish, she claims!"}
{"text":"Well it was cute but it took me 30 minutes to get 1 pancake and a side of bacon (2 slices). I could have cooked this myself by the time they brought it to me. My coffee cup came with free lipstick on it, eeeeew! The waitress was too busy trying to talk to her waitress friends to even address my new empty coffee cup. I'm disappointed after seeing the line when I pulled up."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday morning for breakfast before heading up north. The place was moderately busy. The decor is farmhouse country. Our waitress came by shortly after being seated, to take our drink order. I ordered OJ. The juice came in a blue mason jar, but was only half full. After reviewing the menu I decided in the 2 egg breakfast. I ordered my eggs cooked over-hard, and sausage. The breakfast also included potatoes and toast. I ordered my toast dry. When the food arrived shortly after ordering, I dug in. My eggs were cooked perfectly, the toast was toasted perfectly, the potatoes could have been a little more crispy, but that's a personal preference. I loved the homemade sausage. I couldn't eat everything as the portions were large. But everything was good, from the service to the food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place alot. The portions are massive!! I ordered biscuts and gravy and it was amazing! My mother in law ordered a pancake this thing was massive bigger then ive ever seen before.  My husband ordered the chicken fried chicken. The food overall was amazing and i would come back.  But... Its also very crowded and i felt squished.. The seating is to close together and i hate being sat in the middle of a crowded restaurant especially with a 2 year old.  Overall i would come back but i would sit outside so ill wait for the weather to cool off."}
{"text":"This new location is conveniently located at Mesa Riverview. This was our first time there.   It was around 11 and there was no wait. The restaurant is new and clean. A bit overcrowded with tables toward the back room, where we were seated. You ended up bumping into chairs to get by.  The good: the food was good, no better or worse than any other pancake house. Generous portions. I got the Cali Eggs Benedict. One of my eggs was undercooked, but the rest was good. My husband got the Paul Bunyan. He ate every bite. My daughter got the caramel apple French toast. She said it was good, but the apples were still somewhat hard.  The bad: My boys, ages 2 and 5, both ordered the chocolate chip pancake. When they arrived, they were the size of a medium pizza! The waitress could have warned us when we ordered that they were that huge. Needless to say, they each only ate a small fraction of their meals. She brought us a pizza box for the leftovers. The pancakes were on the dry side and looked and tasted more like bread than a pancake.  The service was slow which was disappointing because it wasn't that busy there. The waitress would disappear for long stretches of time. She never did check on us after we placed our order, during our 30 minute wait for food. I had to go find her for our bill. She wouldn't let me read the bill in peace. She cupped it in her hands and held it down low like it was a secret. Weird, right? The bill was $70 for 3 kids and 2 adults! I think we were overcharged by like $30 but I couldn't be sure because she wouldn't actually have me the bill!  I had 2 kids who'd run out of patience, so I handed her my card so we could get out of there. Then when it was time to sign the credit card receipt(and leave a tip), she leaned uncomfortably over my  shoulder like she wanted to watch what I wrote. She also didn't bring back the itemized receipt so I could see what we were being charged for. When she realized I wasn't going to sign until she backed off, she tried to make small talk with the kids. That's the most attention she paid us the whole time.   The food was decent, and I'd probably come back, but order too go. The prices were too high and the waitress made me very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast place! The food is amazing and ever since finding it, we haven't eaten breakfast anywhere else.  There is nothing bad on the menu and the owners are awesome- super friendly and they make the atmosphere feel very welcoming."}
{"text":"Thought I would give this place a try. Called in my order, was told it would be 15-20min. Went in to get my food 30 min later and was told it didn't \"ring in\". The guy laughed while telling me this. Said it would be another 15min if I wanted to wait again. Well guess they don't care about their customers. Huge disappointment"}
{"text":"I have come here many times because I live in the area but today's visit was less than displeasing. Our server Sabrina started off pretty good but then after half of my group ordered drinks she walked away not taking the rest of the tables orders or not even asking if we would like to order drinks and just brought us waters.Then, came back to take our food orders and just rushed through it not even allow the rest of the table to ask to order drinks. Also saying we could not order certain entrées or sides because \"the kitchen would be upset with her.\"After waiting about 5-8mins to be able to get her attention to be able to order drinks she was snippy about it. Food then came out and after everyone getting their food except myself with Sabrina standing right next to me she asked the table is anyone missing anything can I grab you anything else, before anyone could say anything she was gone again for about 6-8 mins then returned with my food saying sorry it was left on the counter.  But as usual food was amazing !   But All I can say is it was upsetting to have such little customer service at what is a \"small family restaurant\"."}
{"text":"My mom and I went to this restaurant today because we had heard really good things about it and it was close to our house. We were not pleased and will not be returning...   Food: my mom ordered the crab cake Benedict and I ordered a breakfast burrito with egg whites (egg whites are an additional $2.50 just FYI).  The food came out very hot- which is amazing since we waited at least 20-25 minutes for it. The crab cakes were not good-they tasted very fishy leading us to think the fish wasn't very fresh. The burrito was good. Nothing too special. There were a few pieces of burnt potatoes in it that I didn't prefer but it didn't prevent me from eating it. Overall the food was just ok.  Not the worst part of the restaurant.    Service: We were very disappointed with the quality of service at this restaurant.  They clearly don't have many expectations for their servers. When we sat at our table we waited 10 minutes before a waitress came up to us and said \"what do you want to drink?\" There was no hi or hello. We ordered drinks and then the lady had to come back and ask again because she forgot what our order was. We then waited another 10 minutes before she came back to take our order. She quickly took our order and was off. Because we waited so long for food, we got to observe a lot of the other staff members. Many were on their phones or eating while working. The people at the table next to us had to practically shout to get their server to come to help them at their table.   In addition the restaurant was dirty- the table was sticky; there were many dirty tables that weren't cleaned until a customer asked to sit at a table; the bar had trash all over it; and there was a disgusting rag under the coffee pot that needed to be cleaned.   We would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time to this cafe and it was not a good experience. Was a Thursday morning about 9am.  1. Food was lukewarm to cold.   2. Waitress did not know what eggs set meant, forgot to bring our side order of bacon with meal, inattentive ...had to flag bus boy down to ask her to come back to the table, was snippy and told us she only been there 2 weeks. Seated quickly to our table.  Pancakes are large plate size. Veggie skillet flavorful but cold  The place was not real busy, so to receive cold food and inattentive service is unacceptable for the price we paid for the meal."}
{"text":"Awesome place! My veggie omelet was delicious and the coffee is spectacular. Great friendly service. I was visiting Mesa from Nashville and wanted something local. This was perfect! Highly recommended for a family-friendly cafe style experience with good food and great coffee!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! The dude who owns it was a pro baseball player and serves up some amazing breakfast and lunch food! The food is cheap and the selection is wide. This place is the best breakfast joint in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious....top notch!  Great food, great service (Lisa is the best waitress), cute decor, and clean bathrooms.  We can't wait to come back nd try other dishes."}
{"text":"we were referred here. My hubby had green chili skillet, it was perfect. It had a wonderful flavor, the eggs were cooked perfectly, the colors looked amazing. Everything about it was fresh and really tasty......... I ordered the cheesesteak and it was TERRIBLE!!! First just the presentation was awful. flat sliced meat on a bun w/these weird battered onion things- big clumpy donut batter around some thin slices of purple onion and a side of bbq sauce?!?. I chopped up the meat myself, and then tried it... the meat was DISGUSTING. It tasted old? bad? freezer burned? I TRIED to eat it, but just had the terrible taste- but at the same time, it tasted like NOTHING. No flavor- NOTHING. When  a different server came and asked if i wanted a box- i told her i really didn't like it at all. She asked a few questions and told a manager, the manager came and apologized and took it off the bill- which was appreciated. She assured me the meat was \"fresh\" and that it \"smelled fine\". Please owner of Henhouse cafe, please reevaluate this meal. The presentation was terrible, the items on the sandwhich- the onion things, the 5 little bits of peppers and bbq sauce was all REALLY disjointed. It doesn't go together. A cheesesteak (in my opinion and like everyone else ive eaten that was good) should be full of flavor, dripping with juice, covered in peppers and onions, chopped up piping hot. You need a sauce- how about au jus or horseradish?!? Save the onion donuts- really they are terrible- whats the thinking behind them? No need to reinvent the wheel. If you rework it, PLEASE let me know. Id love to come back and try it again and give another review of an amazing sandwich that was as pleasing to the pallet as the eye, like the green chili skillet."}
{"text":"I initially tried this place because it seemed like a cute, relaxed place. When I arrived it wasn't that busy, less than half of the restaurant was filled. The food that I saw looked really good, however in the end I wasn't even able to eat anything, because we ended up waiting for so long that we had to just leave. The service was bad. Despite waiting for at least 35 minutes after ordering, our waitress didn't check on us once. We watched several tables of people be seated, eat their entire meals, and leave with time to spare, but for our two-person table it was too much to even refill our drinks."}
{"text":"Wow.  We tried this new location in Scottsdale for a late weekday breakfast. This location has lots of seating, plus a private room and a patio.   I ordered the country fried steak with sliced potatoes and toast.  My husband had the chorizo omelette. Both were very good.    Their specialty is the giant pancakes.  Even their \"regular\" pancakes are huge. Bigger than a large plate. We tried the lemon blueberry marscapone.  It was fabulous.   We took lots of leftovers home.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I met here and she loves this place. It has great decor and I liked how open and spacious it is. They were great about refilling coffee and getting us our water. I was a bit apprehensive of the menu since many of the items contained pork, but I went with their veggie fresh omelet that came with potatoes and toast (I chose sourdough).   Unfortunately, it took a long time for our food to arrive and we watched several tables around us receive their food before us, though they arrived after us. Turns out our order got lost and we got our  plates maybe 45 minutes later. Sounded like it was a fluke, but it still sucked. The food was great though, potatoes were on the crispy side, lots of veggies in the eggs, and the toast was buttered. Staff was friendly and the manager visited us and other tables which was nice."}
{"text":"Finally got around to giving this place a try and it did not disappoint. Came in with 3 Adults 3 kids. We were seated promptly and got our drink orders in right away. We ordered Omelets, Biscuits & Gravy and the Giant Pancakes. Everything was hot and delicious. Our waitress was always around and helpful. The decor is cute. My family had a great experience and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is highly overrated. The food is nothing out of this world. Standard taste for breakfast food. The giant pancakes they sell are huge but not the best tasting pancakes. Their fried chicken however was very tasty and the only reason I am giving them 3 stars. The decor is very hip and modern, but apart from that nothing special."}
{"text":"The food is generally pretty good but there are issues.  First of all they don't put enough gravy on the dish but if you ask for more you get charged $1.99 for an extra side of gravy.  We have asked about this several times and we say we don't want a whole side and regardless of who the wait staff are they say they have to charge for any extra according to their management   Second my friend always orders the HH sandwich which is really good but depending who the cook is, they assemble everything first and wait for the chicken to cook.   While it sits, the potatoes, biscuit, and gravy all get cold.  He sent it back and it came out the same again... chicken was steaming. Everything else was cold.    I always order hot tea and everytime its lukewarm at best and I gave to send it back.    I think at this point after several times of the same issues we are going to stop going there despite the fact that they have some pretty unique dishes that are tasty when hot.    I think all of the issues stem from management and the kitchen staff and not the wait staff themselves."}
{"text":"Just moved into the area.  Found the place by searching on Yelp. Keegan was our waiter, couldn't have been any nicer. My wife and I split two meals, they were both to die for.  Keegan even said he removed all the calories from my strawberry cream cheese cake filled French toast, lol. I WILL BE BACK!!"}
{"text":"Avg, bacon was boring no real taste over cooked. Scrambled eggs not bad little on dry side. First pancake under cooked; second was done. Service good, but wasn't busy. Deserves a second visit maybe on a weekend morn, to see if busier."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Unique dishes and very friendly service. My first experience here was a great one, I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Never had a bad experience with this. I recommend the chicken and waffles, or the biscuits and gravy!! Pancakes and omelets are also very delicious.. Love how the serve the beverages in mason jars! Oh and try to chocolate milk!"}
{"text":"Good enough food but quite expensive for what's offered. 2 slices of bacon is 2.50 as a side order and a cup of coffee is 2.25. I might go back and try something else as the service and food were good though."}
{"text":"Ive eaten at the Hen House for years. The original on Higley Rd is the closet to my home and the one I eat at most. The owner's are supper friendly and makes shore that the customers are well taken cair of. My wife and my self take friends here all the time and my grand son gets the supper pancake witch he can never finish but always takes what he can't eat home. I recommend the Hen House to everyone. If you feel the service is a little slow just look around at how busy they are and be patient the food is worth it. Crossdrawjohn. Gold Canyon."}
{"text":"Great good and average prices. Arrive by 8:15 to avoid the wait. Server was not that friendly. The food made up for it. Chicken and Biscuits were very good."}
{"text":"Lousy service, you could tell the waiter had his game down on calming customers down who were waiting on the slow kitchen. Sadly the wait with my son was way better than the food. Kids pancake was the size of a platter, dude he's three what a waste. It also was a totally flavorless mushy clump of fluff. I had the biscuits and gravy breakfast. Bacon was cold, potatoes had no flavor, biscuits were tough, the gravy was bland, and oddly flavored. My Dr. Pepper wasn't even that good. I have been to the henhouse twice, first and last time."}
{"text":"This place gets busy on the weekends so come early if you can. The portions are huge as well. The kid pancakes feed two adults, share everything here. We sat down and got our drinks quickly. Put in our food order and waited 20-25 minutes for our breakfast. The kitchen is really slow, all the waiters are waiting around to pick up the orders, enough bus boys too to turn over the dirty tables but the food should not be taking that long to come out. Maybe I'll give this place another try."}
{"text":"I'm was going to put a 3 star but my wife ordered me something I would have never ordered but ended up liking it quite a bit. Later I met the owners and really liked getting to know them. Great place for breakfast. I'll post more, they've got some great items."}
{"text":"Great place. I went to the one on Higley and Guadalupe and decided to stop by this location as well! Owners are great and I see them all the time on site! I've tried the Strawberry Cheesecake and it's great! I'm going to try the Chicken Fried Chicken today. I'll let you know how it goes in the next review"}
{"text":"Henhouse is a great place for breakfast/brunch wether you're part of a big family group or just on your own. They offer a traditional home-y feeling atmosphere that is paired well with their comfort styled breakfast menu. Great food, relaxed atmosphere, and a old fashioned approach to brunch. Love it!"}
{"text":"Obsessed. My boyfriend and I are big breakfast people and have now been here twice in one week. There is often a wait, duh it's tiny and amazing, but super worth it. Staff is nice, food is great, and pricing isn't bad. The portions are huge too!"}
{"text":"Took our 4 year old grandson to breakfast here. The kids meal with a juice totaled $9.00 We were very happy we only had one of our grandchildren with us today. Also our breakfast had nice flavor, but nobody's food was warm enough. We ate a couple bites of the huge pancake where it was warm in the center. All in all just okay for the price. Peg J."}
{"text":"Love the vibes! The food is amazing! Pancakes are HUGE!! Great customer service"}
{"text":"Good size portions but the host staff is so completely clueless that you should expect to wait four times longer than you normally would otherwise. I used to think the hour waits were because it's a good restaurant. Not the case. It's an ok restaurant with terrible policies and procedures. No liquor license so don't expect anything but coffee or OJ to drink. Do not expect any help when any concerns are expressed. They don't care.  I would suggest IHOP, the farmhouse, or liberty market for breakfast. Avoid the henhouse!"}
{"text":"What an amazing find!!  I feel service in the East Valley is very good - The Henhouse is FANTASTIC!  Ordered the Diablo Scramble which was amazing. Highly recommend this spot, looking forward to coming back and trying something else.  Do yourself a favor and give The Henhouse a try, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"We were able to sit down immediately and we sat on the patio. It was extremely busy but the first available was the patio. We sat there for 10 minutes without a hello, a drink order or even an acknowledgement. We won't be back, we could get better service at a Denny's or an IHOP. This is unfortunate because we just moved here from Florida."}
{"text":"First time here over the weekend! Really enjoyed it. I can see how this is a neighborhood favorite! Fresh squeezed orange juice, excellent omelettes and benedicts! Two thumbs up for sure!"}
{"text":"Walked in for breakfast today and they refused to sit us as I was getting my kids out of the car.  They said all people have to be in their restaurant to be seated.  So, if your handicapped, senior, etc.  I guess all parties have to walk in, stand in their small lobby area, then sit.  What a joke.  They've lost our business PERMANENTLY!! Spoke to a manager and said it's their policy. Really, your policy to not sit people with parties who are coming in from their car.   This isn't call ahead or reservations.   Literally, we were in the parking lot!  Another epic fail terrible customer experience.  On top of it, they didn't offer any type of we'll take care of you.  So, stick to your hard and fast policy of idiocy and I'll make sure I tell everyone your service sucks!!  My goal is for you to loose business.  A small business should go out of their way.  Not act like absolute idiots!!   Good luck."}
{"text":"By far THE best breakfast place in the east valley. Customer service is great and food is beyond amazing! My favorite is the green chili scramble. Would definitely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"There was a wait for a hostess to seat us but after that service was great, food was fantastic. My husband had chicken and waffles and he loved it, I had crunchy French toast and eggs. I really really enjoyed my food. Very reasonable price for food quality. 25$ for both with nice tip. Definitely going back. Pancakes the size of hubcaps"}
{"text":"Visited twice in a week because this place is on point for breakfast!  Portions are just right and service is great.   I had the crunchy French toast the first time and pancakes (which are huge) the second time around.  This place is definitely in return list."}
{"text":"This was our first time in and it was worth the wait. My son ordered pancakes bacon and eggs. The pancake was huge and fluffy served with warm homemade syrup!! I ordered the vegetable skillet, and that was also a huge portion! Everything came out hot and quicker than I expected due to the fact that they were really busy. Our server was very attentive as I watcher her move from table to table with a friendly approach.  The manager came by and asked how everything was and also friendly. We will definitely be coming back!! Also got a coupon for our next visit!!"}
{"text":"Since my wife and I were headed to this part of town, I saw on Yelp this breakfast place. Our server Courtney was very courteous and took good care of us.  This place was packed and we had a 15 min wait. There are no booths, just tables and chairs which were pretty close to one another. I ordered the Ham I Yam and my wife had the Chorizo Burrito. Our meals tasted pretty good. Wife enjoyed her burrito and my ham was pretty large and thick. I didn't care for the potatoes 'cause I'm a hash brown potato lover.  With that you get a slice of bread and two eggs cooked to order. Coffee was good, not bitter at all. Service was excellent"}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast this morning after bookmarking it as a definite \"have to try\" goal.  When walking in, their awards as best breakfast eatery in GILBERT for the last two years are prominatently displayed.  That said, it was time for the ultimate test. How does it compare to Chandler breakfast joint First Watch which is my absolute favorite?   Since they were already underdogs, their location is more like a local dive, bustling with locals of all demographics.  It's loud with chatter and clanking of plates and pans.  I'm not complaining though.  The atmosphere is country quaint except for some of the sports bras and workout clothed patrons refilling their calorie counters.   My wife ordered the chicken fried steak with eggs and country potatoes and wheat toast.  I ordered the Kitchen Sink omelette with same potatoes and raisin toast ($.29 extra?).  After a reasonable wait, our food arrived steaming hot.  In my haste to order, I forgot to request a low carb alternative as I dove into the omelette and toast leaving my lonely potatoes to cool.  My wife's only complaint was she hoped that all of her sliced potatoes were crispy.   It was good overall but I think I'll stay with my go to breakfast place. It's more savory flavors are calling me back."}
{"text":"Kudos for originality. The Chicken and Waffle Benedict is a must have. The scalloped potato side was a little soft in texture, so a crispier potato or more traditional hash brown would go a long way... regardless, still a must have when in Mesa. Staff service was really good also."}
{"text":"Plate sized pancakes! Went for brunch this past Sunday and got the lemon mascarpone pancake with a side of bacon. The pancake was huge, as were my companion's pancakes, and these were normal portions. The table next to me ordered the \"mama\" stack...two panels yhe size of TWO dinner plates. They had to carry leftovers out in a pizza box! Good eating and the place was filled to capacity."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Everything is fresh and obviously made with love and care. Great down-home recipes. Absolute best breakfast place in the area, and we have eaten at all of them.  Try the biscuits and gravy or the French toast."}
{"text":"Third time here, food was pretty good. But listening to the manager or owner screaming at the staff was really uncomfortable. It's not easy being a server and when someone is showing you disrespect, it can throw your whole day off. I felt horrible for those girls. I noticed other people were talking about her too."}
{"text":"This was a great first time experience, it was packed on a saturday morning and the wait was a  moderate 10 minutes for how busy they were, i was pleased. The server was a  woman who has been in the food industry for years, very friendly and knew the menu well. She was a really good server, all food came out fast and correct, even with changes. The pancakes are great, the california benedict, the biscuits and gravy....we all tasted each others plates...country decor and small town diner feel with great food....will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My family and I are in town seeing each other for the first time in over 25 years (in some cases) because our Grandma is dying at a hospital down the road. I walked in and asked for a table for 15 and was told it wouldn't be a problem. We were promptly seated considering how many of us there were. As my cousins started to arrive drink orders were taken and the staff was friendly and didn't seem annoyed that we were rather loud (especially the baby!) only half of us ate /ordered and again the gentleman helping us was super sweet and seemed unfazed. We had great service, the food was amazing, and the staff couldn't have been any better if they tried. Towards the end the Manager Gerin stopped by our table made brief small chat with us and thanked us for coming in. I apologized for the mess the baby made but again the staff was unfazed and told us not to worry about. No one knew our story, no knew we were only together cause our Grandmother was dying, or that this was the first and probably last time in 25 years that we have/will be all together, but we were made to feel valued, welcomed, and like old friends. If we're in town again this place will get our repeat business. Anyone I know looking for a great breakfast stop in Gilbert will be directed here by myself and my family. Thank you to everyone at the Henhouse Cafe for making our day a little brighter during our trying times."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go as far as to say it was Horrible, BUT....I would say very close !!!!!! I ordered a very basic breakfast the eggs were not quite done and not hot that's for sure, potatoes had NO taste and not warm at all, the only thing hot was the coffee !  I would say it was quite expensive for Breakfast and very sub par at that.  I have wanted to try this place out for a couple yrs now, always closed after 2 or 3pm. But today was a perfect opportunity.  I guess I should of gone with my 1st instinct McDonalds I know there's would of been much much better."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I was surprised there was a wait but luckily it didn't take too long.  Once seated it took very long for our waitress to come to our table.  Then it took a long time to order.  I felt their prices are bit steep considering I could have gotten more for the price at IHOP or Denny's.  I would come here again if needed but wouldn't jump at the chance.  I did like how friendly all the workers were!!!"}
{"text":"This place is super good! It is always busy on the weekends which is kind of a drag, but for the food the waiting time makes sense. I personally love their biscuits and gravy and cereal crusted French toast. I also am a fan of any restaurant who carries flavored creamer for their coffee!"}
{"text":"Were here around 8:30am on a Wednesday. Not too busy at all, and the food was pretty good. I ordered the blueberry lemon marscapone pancake, it was so big it hung off the plate. Apparently they have an even larger pancake called Moms, I don't know who would order it unless it was for several people to share. Mine was delicious and over half of it is in my fridge for tomorrow and maybe the rest of the week. My wife had the crisp French toast, and that was really amazing too. Crispy and sweet, not flat and oily like some places French toast. Her side of fried potatoes (red potatoes!) was cooked in bacon grease like her mom used to, yum!  The only loss of a star is for hot tea the only option was regular black tea. I love a cup of earl grey or English breakfast in the morning.   Staff was friendly and attentive. Their decor had their own kitschy vibe that even had a few pieces for sale, nice to see their supporting local artists instead of your run of the mill \"same weird stuff on walls\" like some places."}
{"text":"Green Chili Skillet!!!  That's it.  First time we went there, the owner recommended and I have never gone astray.  Will keep it simple, the food is AWESOME.  Kids and wife love the Country Benedict.  Service needs work and kitchen is slow.  On one visit, we waited almost 40 mins for our food and we were sitting at the bar.  We have also tried calling in our order for pickup but they have never been on time when they tell us how long it will take.  Would be a 5 star if service and food wait times were bearable.  I will always go there for the Green Chili Skillet but I know to set my expectation.  Do not go when you are hungry and set yourself up for a wait."}
{"text":"After seeing my bosses photo of his Country Fried Steak on FB, I had to give it a try. I'll be honest, I wasn't disappointed in the least. I had that Chicken Fried Steak and substituted a Biscuit and Gravy instead of toast. I had the gravy on the side so it wouldn't make my wonderfully crispy steak soggy. I noticed that they also had a Chorizo Gravy so I asked for some of each. The regular Sausage Gravy was very nice (could have had more sausage and pepper) but it didn't even compare to the Chorizo Gravy. It was FANTASTIC! One of the best uses of Chorizo I've ever had. Rich and tasty and so delicious I could have eaten a gallon of it. I used what I didn't eat on the steak on the biscuit.  The home fries were nice along with the eggs and my wife's Coconut Glazed French Toast really made her happy. I will be back here very soon and I'll try to buy a quart of that Chorizo Gravy to take home with me."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always wonderful service and the food is excellent! The big pancake was way to big but it was fun to experience it. The crunchy French toast is my hubbies favorite..French toast coated in smashed up captain crunch (which is weird to me but he loves it). I have had the regular French toast which is awesome and homemade cinnamon rolls are sooo good !"}
{"text":"Great little atmosphere. Last couple times eggs and one time the pancake, have not been cooked but would still return in heartbeat."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. This really saddens me to make this review, as we've eaten here numerous times over the last few years. Since opening other locations, the customer service here has absolutely tanked, along with the food consistency. Now, you get a seat yourself, while Ms Scowling frowny face tries to muster up the effort to come take your order. If you are having a bad day, that's fine, but please don't share it with your customers. And when there 4 or 5 employees standing around, laughing and giggling while passing the cell phone around looking at pictures, there's and issue. Please take that behind the wall where all of your customers are not watching you while needing drinks. Bacon, if you precook a bunch to make it easier to dish later, that's fine, but at least throw it back on the griddle and heat it up. Tbere is absolutely no excuse for the plate to be warmer than  the old and cold, hard bacon . Maybe consider getting a training from The First Watch team to learn how to properly serve customers."}
{"text":"It was just ok........  nothing special.   Service was average.  Food was average.  Coffee was average.  For example........  Their potatoes they serve for breakfast are sliced boiled potatoes. Not fried, no onions or peppers just sliced boiled potatoes.  Even processed hash browns are more appealing.  Their gravy is resturant \"just add water\" no sausage bits or anything.  How can not make gravy? Or fry potatoes?   I would call this place the \"Lazy Hen\""}
{"text":"OMG!  Epic breakfasts no matter what you get!  I love the corned beef hash and the chicken fried steak is amazing!  Their pancakes are so large you take leftovers home in a pizza box. Come with a large appetite and ready to wait...it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"So love this place. Great food, great service. Have recommended this place to everyone. Their eggs Benedict is the bomb. Their lunches are great. So good always have to wait but so worth it."}
{"text":"We have frequent this place in the past and it has been awhile since we have been there. It's seem to be going down hill. We were charged .99 for slice tomato for substituting potatoes. I brought it up to the waitress that it wasn't in the menu nor did she inform us of the charge that other places usually tell us of extra charge. She didn't seem to care.  We were  in the restaurant til about 10 mins. before 2:00 when they close and one of the waitress was calling in pizza for all the employees and going around telling them how much they owe. I feel that should be done when the restaurant is closed and no customers are still there."}
{"text":"The wait to get seated and food was ridiculous. More server staff might help. .... Got our food. I got the chorizo omelette.... The food tastes awesome! We also got the the mommas home made pancakes! When they say \"it serves six\" ... they F'ing mean it.   So I would go back again, fo' sho'! But I'll plan for a little extra wait time. I gave it 3 stars only because of the lack of wait staff and time it took to get our food.  But regrdless of that ... Check this place out!   Quick tip - Go with a date, 2 people get in quick."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the breakfast here. I've tried the mascarpone  pancakes (very good and huge), the chicken fried chicken and eggs and the Sante Fe omelette- all were excellent. For those who like biscuits and gravy, try the chorizo gravy- wow. The homemade sausage patties are the best you've had anywhere. When you're all done with breakfast, absolutely save room for the cinnamon rolls, which are unbelievable.  All the great food is complimented with warm, attentive servers. I've never had a bad experience with staff here. Really great folks!"}
{"text":"The look of this restaurant is very cute and country. The food was alright. My husband ordered brown sugar oatmeal and the oatmeal came plain with no brown sugar. When we asked for it they informed us they were out. They comped the oatmeal without is even asking. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I would go back, but would probably be more likely if the food was kicked up a notch or two."}
{"text":"This is our go to place whenever we are craving their delicious chicken and waffles with all the different toppings they provide (spicy syrup, regular syrup, and white gravy) the best! Their service is always top-notch and the servers go out of their way to make each visit unique.   Today we decided to try their new Green bloody Mary, thanks to their manager, Payson. They used a green tomatillo base different from the regular premix that every other restaurants  normally use, giving it a rich flavor with an added subtle hint of spice. Simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast / lunch spot. There is a wait but its worth it. Pancakes bigger than a full size dinner plate. Many varieties of eggs Benedict too."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant after church on Easter Sunday, knowing full well that there would be a wait and it would be busy.  It WAS busy, but surprisingly, we were seated in 20 minutes.  The food took a while to be served, but as I said , it was pretty busy, so we were content to chat over coffee and wait.  The food was really, really good, and our server was awesome as well!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wait was long, food mediocre, service satisfactory.  30-45 minutes wait for seating on Sunday 11am another 30-45 min before food came.  Crab omelette special used fake crab sticks - no real crab at all.  I wouldn't have ordered it had I known it was such low quality ingredients.  French toast just ok.  Wasn't worth the wait - their high ratings must be due to large pancakes which we did not order."}
{"text":"I wish there was a zero star option.  Rude staff, poor customer service and obvious lack of experience running a restaurant. This was my 2nd visit after I wasn't that impressed the first time.  I won't make that mistake again.."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would! The wait is crazy, but the place is small so it makes sense. They are so good they always have a line out the door. Try to go off hours so you dont have to wait as long. The staff is amazing, everyone is always happy and helping each other out. I like that they interact with you instead of just giving you your food and calling it a day. The menu is great, I think between my family and I we have tried just about everything on the menu. We always leave happy and stuffed! Watch out when you order the pancakes, they are ginormous!!!! I would try the biscuits and gravy or the chicken fried stake! Keep it up Henhouse you guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, there seems to always be a little bit of a wait. The French toast is ok but the syrup is weird. My daughter really likes the kitchen sink omelet. The Mexican eggs Benedict is super good. Service is good, decor is nice/interesting."}
{"text":"Hands down a 5+ experience!  We arrived just 20 minutes before closing time so I was concerned that we might not have a great experience.  Nothing could have been further from the truth!  We were greeted immediately and in a very friendly manner - not the eye-rolling, I-wanna-go-home greeting I'd prepared myself for.   The restaurant is extremely clean and nicely decorated.  Our server, Candace, was fabulous!  She was friendly, knowledgeable, efficient, patient and frankly delightful.  Honestly everyone we came in contact with was friendly.  Now the food...oh my the food!  There aren't words.  Please see the pictures and know that it tastes as good as it looks!  You will not leave hungry; that's for sure!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on our way back home out of state. This place is amazing. The staff and manager are super friendly and kind; going out of their way to make sure we had everything we wanted. The food is out of the this world. We ordered the Cali Benedict, Chicken Fried Steak, and Lemon Blueberry Pancake. This is definitely our new go-to breakfast spot when we come into town."}
{"text":"Great food I had the Texas eggs benidict and my husband had the Santa Fe omlette both were outstanding. Coffee was good, no idea what the one reviewer was talking about.  Most restaurants coffee is weak,  as if they just passed the grounds over the top.  The Henhouse coffee is not weak coffee.  Over all it was a great place to eat."}
{"text":"We sat outside with our pup. Ordered the country Benedict and HH breakfast sandwich and they were both off the chain!! Highly recommend. Worth the wait. Staff was friendly and great!"}
{"text":"Love this little gem! The Food is amazing and the service is prompt and polite.  We have tried about half the menu and have never been disappointed,  highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time. Came with family and friend at 9:30am on a Friday,  and it's very busy. Food is good, menu is reasonably priced, and service is decent with all the customers. We're definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Service was excellent but the food not so good. My husband had biscuits and gravy and the gravy was cold. They only make one size of pancake which was way too big for my granddaughter so more than half of it went to waste. Neither me or my granddaughter like the taste of the sausage or thst went to waste too."}
{"text":"Great tasting OJ. I had the biscuit and gravy breakfast with a side of sausage.  Two large paddies with excellent flavor. Eggs cooked exactly as requested. Sadly no grits."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning around 10am and were seated right away. They have a big menu with just about anything you could want for breakfast. Food came out quickly and did not disappoint. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Was told that my wait would be 45 minutes... Been waiting for almost an hour, 8 other people have been sat in front of us.  All they give are excuses, which is unfortunate since we are regular customers.  Will most likely never be regular customers again.  The only reason we kept coming back was because the food was great.  The service from the hostess to the wait staff is AWFUL!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I got French toast and some scrambled eggs... both cooked to perfection. Great place for families or to go with friends. Such a cute location... minimal seating however so there is a long wait for Saturday's and Sunday's when I tend to go."}
{"text":"The plates are enormous the food is excellent we happen to just be driving down Higley and stumbled across this little gem definitely will be going back again great food great flavor good service typical Cafe setting definitely come check this place out for a good breakfast"}
{"text":"Good experience for a first time. Upon first walking in, there were several people at the register, so I was unsure if it was a seat yourself or wait to be seated.  After a minute or two a waitress offered me a booth, but still a little disconcerning not knowing what to do.  Since the place has only been opened for 7 weeks (as I was informed)  I try to be as open as possible to new businesses.   DECOR: The restaurant looks like it had a nice, clean and simple country feel, though I feel the overabundance of white walls, white doors, white columns can be overwhelming to the point that it can feel bland and washed out. Maybe a little paint on the columns and french doors to warm the place up a bit maybe? Some fresh flowers or plants?  STAFF: The waitresses were all friendly, attentive and upbeat.  Confident and informative about the menu and very accomodating.  One con: While paying for my check, the woman at the register seemed confused at the computer system. She called  to the owner (though very pleasant) was eating a hamburger by the kitchen. I've always learned that staff should NEVER be eating in front of customers.Lowers the level of professionalism down a notch.  FOOD: Ordered the BLTA with pasta salad and an ice tea.  Now this is what I call a BLT! The sandwich size was hearty and served on texas toast (the way it should be! Sorry Jason's Deli LoL) I love the fact that you can see the ingredients from the side of the sandwich ensuring you've got your money's worth. Nothing is sadder than a weak portioned BLT.  Tomatos & avocado were fresh (avocado were the perfect consistency of smooth but not too overly soft). Before writing this review, I was actually skyping my brother in Dubai and letting him know I just had the best bacon EVER. Crumbles at the right crispiness, not too overly salty or sweet, thick and plenty of slices to compete with the thick texas toast.   Cons: Though the texas toast was delicious and crispy, a little bit of a downer when it leaves your hands oily that you have to use your napkin often. The lettuce had a bit of browning at the edge of the leaves also.  Pickle slices on the side were also just ok, a little on the limp side and wasn't sure if it was too much saltiness or acidity that left me feeling unsure if I liked them.  Also, I didn't see any options for the iced tea, would love it if you could customize with different fruit or syrups...  Pro: LOVED the pasta salad. I am extremely picky when it comes to pasta salad! Majority of places (and when people make it homemade even), it is either: Too bland, too much vinegar, too much pasta or too much veggies. I need a pasta salad that is the PERFECT pasta to veggie to taste ratio. Needless to say I even asked for a side to take home.  Have not tried the breakfast yet (which I hear they are really good for). Will be back again to try a breakfast dish and be back with another review!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Love going here every weekend.  Both locations are great.  I'm yet to have anything on the menu that I don't like.  Be warned there is typically a wait for seating, but well worth the wait.  Bring an appetite as most plates are good portions with tons of great flavor."}
{"text":"Everything we've tried has been awesome!  The snickerdoodle muffin and the pb and chocolate were over-the-top good!  Busy Sunday am before church and was told the home-made cinnamon rolls sell out.  It's a great place to eat and service is great; the servers are truly a delight!"}
{"text":"So I really wanted to like this place. But unfortunately the service is some of the worst I've ever seen and experienced. Me and my family went here for breakfast this week and ordered some French toast (amongst other breakfast items.) The French toast made me feel sick after a bite (WAY too sweet) and so I asked if I could swap it out for something else. They took my nearly brand new plate of food and sent it back to the kitchen. BUT when we got the bill, they made me pay for the French toast and the different item I received! I ate one bite and I would've given it to my son/husband if I would've known I was paying for it. The owner was extremely rude about it. All of this was communicated to me thru the waitress because obviously she can't talk to her patrons herself. I don't support businesses that don't put the customer first, especially when your food isn't good!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! I ordered the chicken fried steak & eggs. Sausage gravy was YUMMY! My only complaint would be; that the pancakes are not as yummy as other places I've eaten. Granted my daughter loved it & the pancake was bigger than her head (she's 3 lol). To me it tasted like store bought pancake mix not fresh. I want to try the French toast next time."}
{"text":"So i visited this place yesterday and was left underwhelmed. I will say the staff was friendly, but the food was not very impressive. I ordered the Cali Benedict, my mom had the Two egg combo and we shared the strawberry cheesecake french toast. The two egg combo was done correctly (eggs cooked as requested, over medium), no complaints there except for the potatoes. The potatoes on both plates were very bland. There's a slight hint of rosemary in them but that's it, nothing else to give them flavor. We were told the french toast was very good. Personally i wasn't impressed. It was overly sweet and didn't have the crisp aspect you would expect for it being crusted in cereal. The strawberry syrup had an artificial flavor to it, plus the whipped cream was like whipped topping and not real whipped cream. All combined it fell flat. Now for the Cali Benedict (English muffin, bacon, avocado and eggs), it took well over 5 minutes for it to come out after the other plates arrived. When I cut into it, both eggs were extremely over done. They were like hard boiled eggs. I let our waitress know and she apologized and corrected it. The new order came out pretty quick compared to the first one. But it also was pretty bland, the hollandaise had little flavor, you couldn't really discriminate between the poached egg and the sauce. The muffins were pretty thick, which would have been ok if the sauce had been on point. There was also not much bacon on top of that, and my potatoes were also unseasoned and lacking flavor. Aside from the food there were two other issues that influenced our experience: So first off we got there around noon (they close at 2pm). We understand wanting to get ahead of the closing tasks (I've worked in the food industry, trust me I know) but please wait until customers are done eating or at least close to being done before interrupting to take the jelly bins or anything else to restock. This happened to us as well as another table. We were probably half way through our meal when the gentleman asked us this question, but the other table hadn't even ordered when the guy goes 'oh are you guys going to use any jelly? If not can i take this away?' They paused surprised (probably since they just sat down and hadn't even ordered yet) and said umm we're not sure. He left them alone at that point. Second please wait to wash down the sidewalk in front of the door until closing, it's not only a slip hazard but also not pleasant to track dirty water into your car due to walking through the patio food debris + water to exit the restaurant. Overall this won't likely be our go to choice for great breakfast."}
{"text":"SPRING TRAINING FANS! This is by far my FAVORITE breakfast place..and I have eaten at several in the East Valley..even some that have been on THE best places to eat breakfast for the past 18 years. The menu is vast from down home meals like biscuits and gravy ( Try the nontraditional chorizo gravy if you want something with a twist),the skillets, (the Green Chile Skillet is to die for) or try something the owner created  like the Strawberry Cheesecake French Toast! Everything is wonderful and its so hard to decide! One more wonderment...Blueberry Lemon Mascarpone Pancakes! And then there's the.... Just come in and look at the menu and you will see what I mean!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love it so much we had to stop going there so much because we were getting bigger than our pants. It's very very rare that you see the owner and his wife working just as hard if not harder than the staff. They are engaged with all of the patrons and are very welcoming. Although the wife is rude sometimes. it was a busy Sunday morning and all but one of our party members was there waiting for our table and then we finally get called to sit, however mrs. Grouch said we are not allowed to sit unless all of our party was there. We told her they would be here any minute thus wasting another 20 mins even though the guy showed up literally 1 min after she told us we couldn't sit. Otherwise mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Another restaurant defeated by the giant pancake option on their menu. These take upwards of 20 min to cook and patrons end up throwing away more than 80% of the ridiculously gargantuan cakes anyways. What it does do is slow down food orders for everyone else. Waited 20 min to be seated but what was unbearable was the 45 min waiting for food after our order was taken. Food that came after was likewise served in gargantuan portions but nothing special in terms of quality.  Potatoes came burnt and unreasonably underseasoned. Not worth your time. I recommend checking out Joe's Farm Grill nearby. Still a long wait, but in my opinion far more worth it for the novelty of the nice little farm out back they have and the delicious strawberry lemonade! About the same price range too."}
{"text":"Love going here for breakfast I always get French toast with a side of sausage or potatoes. The sausage is so good I think they make it at the restaurant. I've had one bad server (very rude and messed up multiple times on our order, he wouldn't listen) but usually the service is great"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE STAFF. Manager cleared our plates before I was done eating - when i protested, I was told that there was only \"this much food left\", she deems herself the eating police telling customers how much they are allowed to eat. I told her I wasn't going to pay for my entree. She said she would discount it 50%, came back with the bill discounted 15% because that's how much food was left on the plate and that' s how much her \"corporate\" manager was discounting it. Trust me folks, there aint' nothing corporate about this place. I said, no. It was unbelievalbe that this manager wanted a scene to be made in a busy restaurant during breakfast because they wanted me to pay $6.00 for food I didn't get to eat. Seriously? I wrote a letter to \"corporate\" aka owners, which don't have a \"corporate\" mailing address - only the restaurant address so let's be real here. The fish rots from the head, if this is how the owners allow their managers to run the place then I guess I'm not suprised I havent' heard back yet. TIP: EAT FAST OR THEY'LL TAKE YOUR FOOD AWAY AND CHASTISE YOU FOR WANTING TO EAT IT ALL. P.S. food isn't worth the trip anyway, but that's not the point. Go to First Watch or Snooze."}
{"text":"This use to be one of our favorite places for breakfast. Not any more!  My husband and I went this morning at 8 am. The place was full except for the counter. We were the first to wait so we gave out name to the hostess. 3 more families came in and followed suit.  A couple of local A listers (presumably, otherwise why my chopped liver treatment) walk in and the hostess asked how many and they said 2 and she said.....one second while I clear off a table.    We left and we won't ever be back!"}
{"text":"I really REALLY like this place. This is my third or fourth time eating here. I came here initially because I was looking for a place to eat breakfast that has table service but was also dog friendly. But I kept coming back because of their awesome service and their great food. Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a picky eater and usually a server/cook's nightmare. These guys totally get me! After all we all have different tastes right?? As it is, their food stands out above most other places I've been. I sit on the patio since I have my dog, Desiree with me, it's been chilly the past few weeks but they keep my coffee warmed up the entire time! My server Bailey was friendly and attentive (thank you!) The rest were awesome too! Try their corned beef hash!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Thank you Maya! Don't miss out on the breakfast sausage and the pancakes."}
{"text":"Clucking Awesome! Even better than that pun right there (you're welcome).  As you can see from people's pics, the pancakes are MASSIVE. Unless, you have a family of 6 or are a world-class competitive eater, do yourself a favor and order the short stack (still too much for most mere mortals)."}
{"text":"Henhouse was a good and popular location. We went on a Sunday morning, so it was definitely busy with a line out the door and large groups waiting - so if your with more than two people during peak hours, it may be a bit of a wait. With two of us we were told about 30 minutes but we're seated working 5-10 - which was great!!  After being seated we thought service was a bit slow although we recognize it was fairly busy there so I guarantee it was not a fault of the server but maybe a short staffing that day. With that, we also thought it was fairly loud. Not just with other customers but also the staff was loud yelling to others about taking food places or needing things at tables right in front and around us.   We felt the coffee was not super strong - so if you add cream start with less and go from there. The taste was otherwise okay. Our server was on point with the refills.   The food was good! We would definitely return here and I would be excited to try other items on the menu! We started with a cinnamon roll, which was good but a bit pricy. I did think the omelet was a bit smaller than expected but the flavor was great!   Overall this is definitely a poppin place to go to that is well worth the wait. Large groups beware, the wait is probably longer during peak hours. The prices are a bit high (I thought) about $12 for me before the tip - including a coffee (and my buddy got stuck with the cinnamon roll; costed $18 total for him)."}
{"text":"I was told this place is great and has the best breakfast. I thought I would try them so i called in a single order for pick-up. I went to pick up my order 15 mins later. The hostess told me, \"go find your server and tell her you're here\" i didn't know who \"my server\" was. Finally another lady helped me and found the lady who took my order. This lady says, \"sorry i was in a meeting, I have to put in your order now\" .. By this time I was so frustrated I just left. Not the best service and sadly I didn't try their food."}
{"text":"Our first time here and it didn't disappoint. Biscuits & gravy, chorizo burrito and Texas Benedict all delicious."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Henhouse Cafe is the best brunch place in Gilbert that I've experienced!!!! Don't expect a fancy meal or something \"sprinkled with lemon zest\" to that nature but expect to get an EPIC AMERICAN BREAKFAST!  All the dishes I've had are huge portions and they taste great! Great way to start a weekend on a full stomach of home cooked breakfast and brunch foods!   Share a big pancake with your significant other!!!! It's awesome! I highly recommend the meatloaf egg platter. It's so hardy and so flavorful! My wife usually gets some kind of biscuits and gravy or something else but that's also awesome!!!  The best thing about this place though is that it feels \"home-ey\"!!! It has that small town feel where you think that everyone in the cafe is your neighbor! I love this place and I recommend it to anyone who is in search for a breakfast place in Gilbert!!!! Be expected to wait a little bit though if you're in a part bigger than 2, cause it's pretty popular!"}
{"text":"This place had a cute atmosphere and my vegetable soup was quite good, but my friend is a vegetarian and they gave her a difficult time because she didn't want meat in her meal. The server told her that they don't like to make special modifications to the orders. In addition they wanted to charge her extra for cheese (which somehow didn't even make it into the meal) even though she was just trading it for the bacon that she didn't want in it. Just kinda a bummer experience..."}
{"text":"I had the country fried steak and eggs.  It was good.  I would order it again.  The gravy was average.   Eggs were cooked perfect.  The service was outstanding.  We sat outside and the waitress checked on us just the perfect amount of time.  The food was hot and served quickly even though they were busy.  I will definitely stop there again."}
{"text":"Great grub and wonderful staff makes this place a must visit breakfast joint in the north Gilbert area.  Local food, local people and a lot of local love. Pancakes are SOLID!"}
{"text":"Perfect Sunday breakfast spot for my family! The food is delicious and large enough portions to get a bit of everything and share. Our server, bailey, was attentive and personable. He suggested the strawberry cheesecake French toast and it was the perfect breakfast treat! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"I went with my mom and dad with my little boy. I had the nicest employee and enjoyed talking a lot. He served us is VERY well. My parents been there before and it was my first time there. He was very helpful and the food was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Don't go to this establishment if you want to have a healthy option. I asked if I could create my own omelet, she said yes. Do you have egg whites? Yes, but there is and extra charge for those. Can I have something other than the potatoes that come with it? Yes, but that's an up charge as well. I basically got some avocado on my omelet for an extra charge without the potatoes. The omelet was just OK with sliced cheese on the inside and missing the green chili that I asked for.   Also, I asked if I can have a small pancake for my 21 month old? She won't eat everything that comes with it on the kids menu. \"Yes, but the pancakes are the same size regardless\" (the size of a small pizza, by the way)... for a baby? Even a big kid couldn't eat the whole thing. Seems like a total waste of food.   My suggestions: Offer a healthier option and maybe make it cost more on the menu if the items really do cost your more so you don't have to mention \"extra charges\" to make it seem less appealing.   Also, offer an actual kids sized portion of a pancake. Maybe a few silver dollar sized would be plenty for a toddler a few more for a bigger kid. The one that we received was the same as a \"side\" pancake an adult would order. What we received was more than any adult should ever eat in one sitting. Sharing it between 2 adults would even be filling.   I know it sounds silly to complain about portion sizes being to big but wasting food is a problem and I hate doing it. I wasn't going to eat the rest of my daughter pancake and it's not going to be good the next day.  Why isn't it possible to take the same batter and make a smaller pancake and charge a couple bucks?"}
{"text":"Yaaassss!!! This place is awesome! Came here on a weekday, (because anyone who goes to a breakfast joint on a weekend should know what they're getting in to). I had the chicken fried chicken with biscuits and gravy and despite it being beyond delicious, I couldn't finish it. My son got a blueberry lemon mascarpone pancake the size of a large pizza. The prices were affordable compared to most breakfast spots, and now that we know how big the servings are, we'll order differently next time and split things.  That's the sign of a good meal, when you're already planning what you're gonna get next time."}
{"text":"The food here was good, not stellar, but good. I give the Henhouse Cafe 5 stars because of the staff. All the staff if very nice, attentive, and the food is reasonably priced. Service is quick.  I met my older sister and her 3 month old here for breakfast. We've been estranged for years and it was our first meet up, plus the first time I met her baby. Needless to say, I was very nervous.  I got there first and sensing it would be busy on a Saturday morning asked the greeter if it would be possible to make arrangements in advance due to the baby (I didn't want to disturb any other diners and didn't want them to have to rearrange the place for us).  The server said no problem and after I explained the baby would just need a chair for her car seat she went to work. By the time my sister arrived, about 10 mins later, they had a table ready for all three of us. It's the little things that can make you comfortable!  My sister had the veggie omelet & I the florentine eggs Benedict. They were both wonderful and we hope to make this our regular breakfast spot as we work to clear the air."}
{"text":"I came here today with my mom and step dad since I had to work for father's day yesterday, and I can safely say I won't be coming back. I try not to give such negatively focused reviews but it was a pretty unpleasant experience. The place looks cute and it's owned locally which I absolutely support, but I would need to hear about some major changes before returning.  Our server was Stacy, and she was pleasant and joked along with us at first, but did not once refill our waters, which were emptied fairly quickly. My parents both drink decaf coffee, and when we hadn't seen our server in a while, my step dad asked another girl passing by if they could have a refill on the decaf coffee she said \"Yeah.\" and sounded pissed off about it. I mean, I don't expect her to bow and tell us she lives to serve or something, but it shouldn't be the greatest inconvenience in the world to fill a coffee cup. When our server returned to fill their coffees, it was caffeinated.  I ordered the Greek omelet which arrived about 20 minutes later, undercooked with potatoes which I asked not to be included. My mom ordered two eggs over medium and toast, and one came back almost over hard and the other was cooked all the way through. My step dad got smothered potatoes, which he said were okay.  Stacy was nice, but inattentive and slow, and I hate giving a bad review because I'm a server as well, but it should have been simple, nothing was complicated about our orders, and it was overall a huge disappointment.  This was my first time coming in, but my step dad and mom have been in twice before and both times spoke with the owner because they had problems with their experience (hour long wait, wrong food, water not being refilled, etc.) and hoped something had changed. I guess the third times the charm because they both will not be returning either."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places. Love the smothered potatoes w a biscuit and gravy. (They don't have it all the time) Oh sooo yummy! The pancakes are ridiculous, in a great way. Hope your hungry."}
{"text":"The Henhouse opened right near our house and we were fast to become regulars.   There isn't anything, yet, on the menu that has been anywhere near a disappointment.   My kids (and I) are huge fans of the Belgium waffle which is light and delicious and doesn't make you feel like you ate a ton of bricks :) My husband switches between the biscuits and gravy and the kitchen skillet omelet which has .... Well, it's in the name....everything in it.   I like the veggie omelet.    Only note is to watch out for the pancakes.   They are delicious but one pancake could easily feed 2 people.   Enjoy"}
{"text":"Came in with a large group of adults and children after a bike ride 40 min before closing.  Seemed clean and the menu looked great.  My son loved their chicken fried steak and our girls were stoked about the Huge pancakes that were pretty good.  Chicken salad was great and my husband loved his Diablo scramble and the other scrambles were excellent.  In fact all the food was pretty great.  A little disappointed that my potatoes were undercooked...maybe because they were hurried to get out the last customers of the day.  I would only recommend that the staff check the cleanliness of the dishes.  Found 2 hairs on my plate after finishing almost all my meal.  Also one of our water cups was dirty inside and at the end of the meal while pouring my water I noticed the top of our water picture where the water came out had a dirty and greasy film on top.  Pitty to loose my appetite after such amazing food."}
{"text":"I haven't written a yelp review in a long time but this called for one.   Why is there so many good reviews? I don't understand what is so good here.   The iced tea is powdered, the orange juice is from a box, the water is from tap. The tables are set up in the most bizarre way it's uncomfortable.   Ordered eggs, potatoes, bacon and a side of pancakes. The potatoes were undercooked and bland. Bacon I couldn't eat as it was overcooked and cheap. The pancake was nothing to write home about.   And do they put MSG in their food?! Left with a dry mouth and headache. Will never ever return."}
{"text":"Myself and a few friends were in the market for breakfast after church. I visited trusted Yelp and found this location in very close proximity to where we worship. We had a 15 minute wait but boy was it worth it. The service was friendly and the food was delicious. I ordered a skillet, one of my girlfriends ordered the veggie \"something\" and the other ordered the french toast. The servings were hearty and our server was very attentive to our needs despite it being a hectic mid Sunday morning. We all left very satisfied and have vowed to return in the near future."}
{"text":"We went to the new location at Pecos and Lindsay.  The first thing that struck us was the cozy decor. The best way to describe it was farmhouse contemporary (Not a bad thing).  I ordered the Farm Boy omelet and my wife ordered the Veggie omelet. The quality reminded me of a good oven - baked omelet but it wasn't.  My wife enjoyed the Veggie. I tasted it and the green pepper taste was more pronounced. She did enjoy the sausage. Her take was that it reminded her of being back home in MS.  As for my dish, I enjoyed mine. However, the potatoes were a bit heavy on the salt.  Otherwise, they were good. The coffee actually had a very nice taste to it.   One thing I would suggest on the menu is an option to build your own omelet. That would give customers the ability to select what they want. I also noticed that they do not have a whole grain bread for the toast. My wife does not eat regular bread and had to go without a side. There should be substitutions for people who have dietary restrictions.  Holly was a very knowledgeable server. That goes a very long way with me. Everyone (including the owner, Brett) was very friendly. Holly was attentive but probably got busy because we had to flag down another server for a coffee refill . However, the server who refreshed my coffee was very friendly. Seeing teamwork like that actually shows they care about customer service.  I did deduct a star for the inability to accommodate my  wife's dietary restrictions. But, we will return since the food was very good."}
{"text":"After our bike ride, my wife and I called in and ordered a breakfast sandwich. I was pleasantly surprised that they had other bread options versus the first visit. I ordered my sandwich with rye bread.   The marbled rye had a very good taste with the fresh eggs and homemade sausage. The potatoes did not have the salt they did previously.    All in all, I am still impressed with the Henhouse."}
{"text":"Found this place when taking my car into Mercedes dealer in Gilbert Great food. Very clean and service was excellent.  I recommend for a great breakfast.  Try the meatloaf and eggs. Delicious."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the LOVE that people have for this place. It's not bad, but it is nothing special at all. and it is very expensive for what you get. The french toast was a major bust. It's made with thin tasteless basic whitebread and had an odd flavor. Maybe orange zest?? The menu description made it sound awesome but it definitely did not taste like that in real life. Our server was inattentive and we had to ask other servers for coffee refills. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has good food and they are super busy.. The only thing I didn't like is that since they were busy it just took a while to get our food.. When our food did come out it was a little cold.. But other then that I would come back here for their breakfast.."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast stop. The sausage is really good, bacon is legit and eggs were cooked exactly to order. I should of ordered a hot chocolate, everyone around me did and they looked wonderful, my juice was good but you know. The pancakes also looked great, I'll have one next time. We got a cinnamon roll to go, heaven in bun form."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, once today and once about a year ago. Great value, good variety on menu. Will be back again soon"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, very nice staff and a very clean restaurant...will definitely go back"}
{"text":"It has been a few weeks since we tried this spot (thanks Yelpers!), so this will be quick review. The wait was less than expected for a busy Sunday morning.The server we had was awesome.  The food came out quickly, was hot, and tasty. I had the chicken and waffle benedict and my SO had the Texas bennies. The C&W were okay, I think they possibly sounded better than they tasted but that's my issue, not their's. I'm not a huge fan of gravy. The Texas bennies were really good... but SO thought mine was better, go figure. A cornbread bottom, green chile pork, eggs and sauce. I would order them again but will probably try one of the many other options that came out. I live vicariously watching other peoples food, lol. And BTW, the portions are HUGE. Consider sharing unless you want take home.  I think for the price, the service, the selection, and the quantity it's a very good option."}
{"text":"Went three times. Third strike you're out!  This time waited for an hour and 10 minutes for breakfast.  Asked the waiter and the food wasn't even started to be cooked yet.  Left and the waiter thought the drinks would be comped as it was a ridiculous wait. But no. Drinks were not and will not go back.  The food was good the first couple of trips but the service is subpar.  The first two trips same long wait.  I signed up for yelp today just to leave this review -  yes that bad."}
{"text":"Henhouse knocked it out of the park again. Always consistent and super friendly service by staff. Veggie omelette was scrummy and the french toast was amazing. Good coffee. Nice enough to sit outside at picnic tables. Will continue to be our bkfst spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in today to start my birthday with a hearty breakfast.  Was sat quickly but it was unusually hot.  Another customer asked the server and her response was that the compressor had died.  It would have been nice to have been informed of that before we were sat."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I went to breakfast this morning at the Henhouse. We had our two little girls and let's just say the baby (3 years old) wasn't exactly well behaved. Preston was our server. He was INCREDIBLE! I've been to this location once before and had another server who was awesome as well. I was too fat and happy to make him a review, but for the record it's the other younger guy who was working today:) Almost a year ago I went to the other location and had terrible service. The only thing that saved them was their food. In fact I may have written a low star review. Anyhow, I work in a super popular breakfast place in Gilbert and this location is the only other place I like to eat breakfast in town. I have a very biased opinion on breakfast:) Preston you (and the other guy;)) are WONDERFUL and deserve so much praise! I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I love the Henhouse! The service is amazing and the atmosphere is homey, comforting, and appealing. After only my second time there the waitresses recognized me, which I really appreciate at restaurants. It means your server truly SEES you and pays attention when they're taking care of you. The menu has some interesting items on it, things like HUMUNGOUS pancakes and a crab cake Benedict! My all time favorite menu item, however, is their homemade sausage patties! Dip them in some of their syrup and you're in breakfast heaven! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Of all of brunch joints in all the world, I had to walk into this one...  It would be nearly impossible to write a productive review of this place without a fiery rage. So I decided to itemize my trip here:  Arrive at exactly 11:50am for brunch, hungry. Get seated immediately by hostess who was friendly Wait for 5 minutes and get drink orders taken great 5 minutes later get drinks and place food order. Great flash forward to 1pm and we are still sitting there with empty drinks and have not heard anything from our server in the hour we have been waiting for our food.  Now I can understand if it were very busy, but it wasnt, there were maybe 10 other tables of 2 or 4 people. I don't understand how you could possibly fuck up French Toast but the cooks managed to do it several times for the table next to me as well as the gentleman in front of me who paid for his meal and waited for roughly 20 minutes to get his card back while the servers all played grab ass back by the kitchen.   I really hate being negative, especially about family owned businesses and I understand that things go wrong occasionally but I have never seen quite a complete lack of shits given about customers or service quite to the level of this establishment.   I'm sure it would be a great place to work, but if you're thinking brunch or breakfast you might as well just save your money and stay home and sit on a wooden chair for an hour or 2 and look at some eggs and it will be the exact same experience as the Hen House Cafe"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!  Love the prices and people are super awesome . Our waitresses name is  Kelly and she was wonderful sweet and very pleasant !! We would really love for Henhouse to move out to a new location to Queen Creek area.   I've eaten at two different Henhouse and love your restaurants. You keep the same quality of food it's like eating at the same one each time!!"}
{"text":"I visited Henhouse Cafe this morning with my brother around 7:30 AM for some breakfast. We didn't have to wait and were seated promptly. The place was decently filled and didn't get too busy until 9 AM. Overall, the experience was great. Friendly servers, delicious food, and a great atmosphere. I think one of the best parts of this experience was that the food tasted like something my mom would make. It actually tasted homemade in comparison to IHOP for example (which I guess is expected when comparing a mom and pop to a franchise). Everyone in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying themselves.  I ordered the Mexican Benedict and it was incredible. The poached eggs went well with the spices and filling of the dish. I thought that it was unique that the cheese they used was a nacho cheese rather than cheddar cheese. I was given two eggs piled on all the meat and filling and was full with just one \"stack.\" My brother ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken. He said it all tasted good except that the gravy was a little overwhelming so if you are not a fan of too much gravy, I would order it on the side. Regardless, the dish was still delicious. Lastly, we shared their special dessert item (I forgot the name) but it was delicious. It was fried and the inside was moist with chocolate oozing out.  Overall a great experience, definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"We all order 3 different breakfast dishes and we all tried each other food and it was all awesome! French toast was awesome too! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a veggie omelet with egg whites. The server said that they don't have egg whites right now because they are too expensive. I asked him if they could just separate the yolks of regular eggs from the whites. The server said no. My veggie omelet was very bland. My wife's chicken fried steak was also very bland."}
{"text":"We been to the Henhouse Cafe so far, we have enjoyed breakfast.  You have to believe it to see it pizza size pancakes.  Great portions of food, great value for the money."}
{"text":"We stopped in to find a 20 minute wait at 930am on a Friday.  The coffee was good my husband liked the crab cakes Benedict and I went for the Counrty Fried steak with substitute of biscuits and gravy for toast (up charge).  The biscuits and graveyard was above average so that was good.  It was solid good across the board.  No complaints but nothing special."}
{"text":"Visited the Hen House and found the ambience quite refreshing from your standard breakfast places.  The corned beef with over easy eggs was good.  Would return to try some of the other dishes..such as, Texas Benny.  Great find."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of brunch, then this might be the place to go. If you're not a fan of the crowds, then move on and let the rest of us move up on the wait list. I kid. By the looks of it, you would have thought it was a weekend brunch crowd when we went. But we actually came in early on a weekday morning...two days before the holidays began. I would have rather sat outside at one of the tables. You Arizonians (is that a word?) think 45 degrees is chilly so we had to dine inside. Oh well. I planned on going the sweet route and get either some waffles or french toast. I saw crab cakes Benedict on the menu, which is one of my favorite brunch dishes, and ordered it instead. It looked very appetizing on plate, but I was sadly disappointed when it didn't taste as good as it looked. The crab cake portion tasted a bit off but the hollandaise sauce and poached eggs were fine and dandy. I'd skip that Benedict dish next time I came to visit and perhaps stick with something more sweeter. FYI: The small stack of pancakes is not small. The brother ordered it in addition to something else, and the pancakes looked like something out of \"Uncle Buck\" (remember the table size pancakes he made?). Get your stretchy pants out for that one."}
{"text":"Great food but horrible service. Was here on a Saturday 10am. Our server Nicole, took our drink and food order and then she was never seen again until we were done and ready for our check and then when she came back to drop off the check she put it down and said alright! And that was it! She was talking to someone else"}
{"text":"First visit to the Henhouse with friends new to the area. Moderate wait for the time we got there. Our server Tanner was outstanding and covered the highlights of their unique menu selections. Good was great and we all enjoyed it very much. Prices are good and you get generous servings. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We love Henhouse Cafe. My only complaint would be the wait time. It's not unusual to wait 30+ minutes on a Saturday or Sunday morning but it's worth the wait. Food is great quality and everyone is very nice. Once seated, food arrives quickly."}
{"text":"I have been here two times and I have not been too impressed with the food. The only thing I liked was the pancakes... super good! But I also got the biscuits and gravy and was not impressed. The second time I got their chicken and waffles. I asked if they had hashbrowns and they didn't (what breakfast place doesn't have hashbrowns???) Our server did say they had little crispy potatoes? So I tried that and man am I mad for spending three dollars on them. No salt and no flavor!! Even dipping it in ketchup didn't help. The chicken was alright and the waffles were good. I tried this place a couple times and have just not been impressed. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Today was my 3rd visit to the Henhouse Cafe, and let me just say this place does not disappoint. Seriously the BEST BREAKFAST IN GILBERT. I recommend the verde omelette. I love their breakfast potatoes and delicious English muffin. Generous portions too. My only complaint is that this place is too popular and you can probably expect to wait for a table. Good for them. Keep up the good food and service."}
{"text":"We love this place.  The food is great and the value is great.  If you order the pancakes then the value is insane.  My only complaint is a minor one...the wait staff seems to be over burdened quite often and they seem to be slow with refills or service quite often.  But the food, atmosphere, wait and value are so good for us that this location is part of our weekly routine."}
{"text":"The food at either Henhouse Cafe is incredible.  The pancakes are so gi-normous that I often will get an order to go and have that as breakfast for a couple of days...and snacks for those couple of days...and maybe lunch one of those days...and still maybe end up having one of the 2 pancakes remaining.  For under $10!!!  We love the place so much that we go every Saturday morning.  They don't even ask our name, in fact they ask us by name how many today.  They are always friendly and warm.  Some servers, of course, are better than others but they all project the feeling that they love being there.  I have my favorites here which taste incredible (Diablo Scramble is my personal favorite).  We bring all of our guests here.  And when co-workers from other states come to town I bring them here.  As a road warrior finding a great, consistent, reliable place for breakfast is a cherished find since we so often have to stuff our bellies with hotel \"breakfast\".  Love, love, love, love!"}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Love it!  Great food, service, atmosphere and large portions.  This place is a keeper."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Hospitality was great and food was amazing as well. Pancakes are huge and I pretty much had the best skillet ever too. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Local Owned and Operated.  We spoke to the owner who said his wife and kids run the place and found out that it's a made from Scratch kitchen with only one small box freezer.   Everything is made in house and you can taste it.   Ruben and the Carnitas Scramble were fantastic.   We need more local owned non corporate places here in AZ.  Support your local businesses and know that the Henhouse Cafe is Delicious!!!!   Going back to have the Pastrami Hash and eggs !!!  Loved it!!"}
{"text":"We just went here this weekend after a friend recommended it and needless to say we'll be going back...no more IHOP or Denny's!!!  The portions are quite large and I loved the fresh cinnamon rolls!  We can't wait to go back to try more on the menu.  The seating arrangements are pretty close and tight...but won't stop us from coming back."}
{"text":"I really don't get it. How this place could have a four-star average is beyond me. We were out in Chandler to look at a car and wanted breakfast afterwards. First Watch, our initial choice, was packed and I just won't wait an hour for eggs I could cook at home in 10 minutes. Unfortunately we were 45 minutes from home.  Henhouse was the next best, closest choice. Glad I don't live out this way, because I would really miss Butter's and Butterfield's in Scottsdale. Hands down, they offer the best breakfast in the Phoenix area.   From the kitschy decor to the below average food it just wasn't worth it. My partner, a very forgiving person, told me the a few days later how awful he thought it was. We both had skillets and they were terrible. The combination was way off. Turkey that tasted like it had been frozen and Yams in a skillet with eggs. It sounded waaaay better than it tasted. And you only get one slice of toast with your skillet. How cheap is that? Bread isn't very expensive.   No. Thank, You."}
{"text":"My official go to spot for breakfast. Always good and fast food and service. Grandpa's Skillet is my favorite."}
{"text":"My father and I went here for an early breakfast. The waitress was fantastic she was friendly she was quick she was knowledgeable she was on point. The food was fantastic and a great atmosphere that was a great setting for a good morning thanks Henhouse this restaurant is the best. I moved to Mesa and there's one right across the street from my house and this location is also great the food is great always busy Quick Service good place highly recommended keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Went for the first time on a Wednesday morning. Seemed a little short staffed so I anticipated or food would take a bit longer than standard, which it did. I also remarked to my wife  that I hadn't seen either server on the floor for probably 5 minutes. She (facing the kitchen area) explained they were busy talking...So I wasn't surprised when our meals were delivered barely warm. My Country Burrito was mostly all potatoes. Neither of us liked their potatoes, though that can be a preference thing. Most disappointing part of meal was the side of sausage. That thing was cool and had been sitting for some time. Gross."}
{"text":"We were fortunate to have been awake a little earlier than normal this morning, and decided to give this place a try. I can see why this was voted the best place to get breakfast in Gilbert. Really glad we got there early, because by the time we were finished eating, the line was out the door. Food was great- I had biscuits and gravy and my boyfriend had French toast... I'd recommend both. Portions are enormous, so be ready to take half of it home! Prices are extremely reasonable, especially for the portion size.  Service was really great- our coffee cups were never less than half full... which is saying something about how prompt the service is because we both drink it pretty quickly.  Definitely will be back... but will definitely get there early again."}
{"text":"I was in the area and starving. All the reviews were awsome so I though I'd give this place a try. The whole restaurant was full on a Wednesday mind you. Every thing on the menu sounded amazing. I decided to go with the Irish Benedict at my server Courtney's recommendation. OMG hands down the best Benedict I have ever had in my life and trust me I've had a lot. I really like tall they use a potato Patty instead of bread I'm allergic to gluten so this was an awesome option for me. My server Courtney was very attentive, fast and  personable. Most definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was so-so. Nothing special.  The women's bathroom door was locked and they had to search for the key. Nothing dramatic. Just, blah."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast experience in a long time.  45 min. To be seated when tables available.  Almost an hour for food to come out and orders were wrong.  Server did not take wrong orders off of bill.  Will never come to this establishment again."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here.  Outdoor seating, no wait.  Kids had the pancake and couldn't finish. I had egg Benedict with chorizo. Super good.  Sizes were very large.  Coffee okay.  Only two bathrooms.  Unexpected surprise, our meal was paid for!  Cade.org..."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding! We've gone for breakfast a few times and it never lets us down. Nice service too! You may have to wait a bit but it's worth it. We'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is amazing all house made.  I had the lemon mascarpone blueberry pancake--you only need one.  It covered the entire dinner size plate.  SO good.  My hubby had the Diablo Scramble which is a house speciality.  Yum. Scrambled eggs with chorizo and jalapeños on top, home made sliced potatoes, and a bowl of pinto beans with a tortilla on the side.  We kept trading our plates back and forth as we could not decide what we liked better.  You will not go hungry here.  The portions a big and the prices very fair.  This is locally owned and operated which we always try to support. Service is efficient and very friendly.  We brought friends from out of town here and they loved it.  The atmosphere is casual and the menu is great.  You can choose from the standard bacon and eggs to great burritos and several types of eggs benedict.  They also have daily specials for breakfast and lunch.  Good for families as well as couples.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch location. I plan to come back soon.  Service was excellent. Our waitress was Hollie and we didn't have to ask her once for refills, condiments or anything!  Food was amazing. The serving sizes were huge.  I always drink iced coffee and theirs was amazing!  The price was outstanding too....2 meals with drinks was only $24!"}
{"text":"Table was sticky when we sat down. Watched our waitress pick up food and garbage off of the ground underneath a table outside and then walk right in and take food to customers. They really should have a dedicated bus staff. If our waitress wasn't bussing she might have had more time to deal with us. Served our bacon almost raw. We asked them to cook it a little more. The waitress was totally put off by that. Brought us back bacon that was so over cooked it was inedible. Message received loud and clear. When customers send something back, you make sure they regret it. Here's a message for you, provide poor service and sub par food, I'll make sure to keep my money out of your register."}
{"text":"Several weekends in a row now, it's my Saturday morning \"daddy-daughter breakfast date\" spot. Be prepared to wait for a table on weekend AMs, but the food is fantastic and portions are large. Friendly staff too, they do well managing the large customer flow and keeping attentive.   Recommend the crunchy French toast, I haven't tried the pancakes yet but I hear they're massive. Next on my list."}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday morning.  Seated right away.  They serve farmer brothers coffee here, I'm from a Royal Cup Coffee Family.   So, coffee is ok, better than awful folgers.  Anyway, got the Chicken Fried Steak breakfast,  comes with a ample amount of home cut potatoes, 2 eggs, and toast or biscuits and gravy.  Very Good breakfast,  the gravy is far better than that of \"Biscuits\" restaurant.  Too get that extra star from me, is that they had \"pumpkin spice creamer\" available.  Best Breakfast So Far."}
{"text":"Cali eggs benefit every time I go.  Always fresh and great service.  So many different choices.  Our Canadian friends were impressed."}
{"text":"It was a good restaurant for breakfast. I liked how the inside looked, we got seated right away and the service was good. Me and my gf got the huevos rancheros and eh it was alright.... didn't really look like huevos rancheros you would get from a Mexican restaurant but something different?! It wasn't that great but if y'all go stick with the pancakes or chicken fried steak.... cause you can't really mess those up at a restaurant lol. So all in all it wasn't a bad place... just stick to the popular foods."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good not great.   Outside seating was nice with the wood picnic tables.  For a Sunday morning breakfast eater it is really hard to get into unless you get there before 8am.   Overall though good with no complaints"}
{"text":"My family and I had a very nice breakfast at the Henhouse Cafe.  The food was very good and the coffee was plentiful.  The only miss was that it being a Sunday morning, the restaurant was full but not overfull.  We were a bit surprised that while the service was timely and attentive, we had to wait longer that we expected to receive our breakfast meal.  We have eaten at the Henhouse a couple of times but this was the first time for the delay.  We'll continue to go back and recommend this breakfast/lunch restaurant to our friends."}
{"text":"We arrived and it was PACKED. Only took 25 min to get a table. Cute picnic seating outside as well. We ordered the chicken fried chicken with a .99 up charge to upgrade to biscuits and gravy instead of toast and a lemon blueberry  Marscapone pancake.  We shared these meals and STILL couldn't finish it all. Portions are huge and staff was very friendly. Coffee and water was constantly being refilled by various staff members so you never had to ask or wait.    We will be back!"}
{"text":"Right when I walked in the staff is very friendly. I came with friends on a Saturday waited about 30 mins and it is so worth the wait. If you are feeling something sweet you need to try the captain crunch French toast, but if you want a pancakes,eggs or bacon they are amazing as well. whatever you order will be great! The orange juice is good as well. Our servicer was a man and he was amazing! Friendly and nice in conversation!"}
{"text":"I don't get the fan following here.  It's ok.  I've eaten here plenty because it is within walking distance to my house, but I would never suggest it or go out of my way to eat there.  I got a omelette this morning and everything was drenched in that greasy grease they call butter.  It's not butter.  It was on my toast, my potato and my omelette.. bleck!  I now feel sick and only ate half.  Stop the madness."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch today with my friend and her mom. We got there around 11:30 ( On a Saturday) The dining room was mostly full so we sat out on the patio.  They took our order right away. The server we had kept saying she was new and had to ask another server for the answers for most of the questions we asked.  My friend ordered a veggie omelette, and asked to substitute a biscuit instead of potatoes and toast that came with, at the end of the meal she was surprised to find they had charged her the normal amount for the biscuit rather than doing a up-charge, or even substitution.   They also charge an extra $2.49 if you want an egg whites only-The server told us its because they crack the eggs fresh to order and the yolks are wasted. - When she got her order it clearly had yolks in it, so she mentioned it to the server, who said that wasn't possible because she definitely wrote egg whites and they are pre-separated in a container and they just measure out how much they need.(That was entirely different than what she told us when we ordered.) We were also told that we couldn't do one of the omelettes without cheese, because they have the filling ingredients mixed together in advance.   Which we thought was weird.  I had the french toast, It was two slices of bread cut in half. It was good, it tasted like you would expect french toast to taste, but had little bits of green bell pepper on a couple of the pieces, probably just due to not scraping off the spatula/grill between items. It was no big deal though.  Waiting on food took longer than we expected, about half an hour from when we ordered, probably just because it was busy. We won't likely go back, The food wasn't anything special, and the experience wasn't great. Not sure if it was due to the new server, or if that's just how the place is."}
{"text":"The pancakes were the size of manhole covers and amazing, i had the breakfast burrito which was nothing special overall it was  bland and chock full of potatoes, eggs, bell pepper, cheese, and the smallest amount of sausage i have see in a burrito in a long time.  Had there been a better ratio of sausage to potatoes and other ingredients it may have been better.  The other order was the country benedict which had  a pair of biscuits piled with sausage covered with a fried egg and then some country gravy.  Not a bad dish, the eggs were just past done and were not runny like they should be and the potatoes while tasty were a bit greasy.  I would come back for some pancakes and maybe try something else like the chicken and waffles but i'll stick to filly B's for breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem.  Would not have found it if not for my brother telling me about it.  In fact he insisted I go there.  When I pulled in I noticed it was located on a corner I drive by quite a bit and never noticed it.  I always saw the gym next door.  Well I had been missing out all this time.  We did not have a long wait for a seat.  The server was super friendly and helpful with describing the dishes.  I went with the diablo scramble and it was fantastic!  I was also impressed with the coffee.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a GREAT breakfast!! I had the best French Toast- Strawberry Cheesecake French Toast. Definitely the place to go for breakfast. Our server, Amanda was wonderful. Very attentive even on this very busy Mothers Day."}
{"text":"1st time we were going to eat at this location. We had a 10 minute wait, which was fine. It was very busy. Once we were seated we were handed our menus. Then that was it. A few more tables were cleaned and guests were seated. The guests after us were served drinks and some even got to place their food order. Still we sat there. Just staring at the menus.  I cannot comment on food as we left after 10 minutes of being ignore. We will bever try and eat here again."}
{"text":"I have been here before many times. I was a little irritated when they upcharge you for 4 tomato slices that was substituted for toast and if you do not like their homemade sausage and want all bacon they upcharge for that also. I mentioned this to my server and she explained that bacon is the most expensive meat and that they have  been upcharging since they opened. I think 99 cents for a substitute for tomato slices is a bit much. I was also confused by the servers response that that is what the owner does and that I'm low man on the totem pole. Weird experience."}
{"text":"We had been to the other location on Higley and tried this location for the first time this morning. We got there at about 10:15 and there was a ~25 minute wait for the 4 of us. It was pretty busy. We got seated and when the waitress came over she let us know they were short staffed. We were already ready to place our orders by the time she came to ask us for drinks, so we went ahead and ordered. We ordered mainly lunch items - I had the BLTA with no mayo. I was skeptical that the waitress was going to get my order right because she seemed to be spacing out while I told her what I wanted. It took quite awhile for our food to us - ballpark of around a half hour. She, of course, put mayo on my sandwich. She offered to take it back and make me a new one, but I didn't want to have to wait another 30 minutes for a sandwich so I told her it was okay and I would scrape it off. She did bring me new pieces of bread pretty quickly which was nice. Food was OK - nothing exceptional by any means. Times before when I had been to the Higley location I got a hash that was SUPER bland - hardly any flavor. Their pancakes are ginormous, rather embarrassing, and pretty much a waste. I definitely won't rush back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Unbelievable crab cake Benedict right here in AZ!! And the biggest chocolate chip pancake I have ever seen!! Great home cooking for our entire family of six and courteous fast service!! Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"This is a place we have really enjoyed for while now. Today was absolutely the worst. We walk in excited to have a yummy breakfast, which has never been a disappointment, but starting with the hostess, there was an \"uh-oh\" moment. She says \"Hi, and only 3 of you today?\" and got menus. We follow her to our table and before we even get to the chairs, she's already bolted. She just put the menus down, took the extra silverware and was already around the corner - no \"Enjoy your breakfast\" or \"Your waiter/waitress will be...\" not even a drink order. Then as we finish looking over the menu, we wait patiently as 1, 2, 3 people pass by us without any acknowledgment. Almost 10 mins goes by and my husband is starting to fume. He says \"excuse me\" to a waitress, she walks away. The waitress that we are sitting in her section walks by, looks at my husband, and continues to walk away. Then we see her round about and takes drink orders and food orders of 2 parties that came in after us! After that, we got up so upset. As we walk toward the exit, the unskilled hostess looks at us and says, \"Have a nice day!\" not realizing that she seated us no more than 15 mins prior. My husband presses the fob key to the car and says he'd meet us outside in a few. I knew then he was going to get a manager to talk to. He explained what I stated above and the manager really wanted us back inside, but it was already too awkward and upsetting. The manager was kind to my husband and said he would address these matters immediately. He gave his business card to my hubs, in turn he gave back his name, and then got in the car so we could go somewhere else. I hope the next time we go back, it'll be so much better."}
{"text":"We ordered one of the large pancakes for our work and the thing was the size of an entire pizza box! What a great way to wow our staff! We typically order from this place early in the morning and always receive speedy service.  Great tasting food, low key restaurant."}
{"text":"They don't take reservations. It was about a 35 minute wait. Not unusual in that part of town on a Sunday morning.  Everyone liked their food.   My \"short stack\" pancake order was two pancakes so large they covered over the edge of the plate.  I could only eat the center. 2 Sauge patties that were fine."}
{"text":"This location was way more popular than the Lindsay and pecos one. Once we were sat after 30 or so mins, our server was super friendly. Food took some time to come out. Looked like they were filming something so the manager was focused on that and nothing else. Kinda missed the servers at the other location.  We tried this one out because it's closer to our house.  Food though. Food was great! We ordered the Paul Bunyan and the fried chicken Benedict. The Benedict was amazing! Definitely ordering that next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I, We went on a Sunday around noon and got sat right away. It took over 30 mins to get our food. I was getting kind of impatient. But the food was pipping hot and delicious. So it almost made the wait worth it.  We could see our waitress was everyone's waitress so they were shorthanded that day. If that was improved, then I would say definitely a 5 star breakfast place."}
{"text":"Has been our go to for a while. Food has always been really good albeit very slow to come out. The Moms Pancakes are a star. I love the lemon blueberry pancake but it's been getting smaller and smaller in size so I've steered away from it. The Carnitas Burrito is great but c'mon if it says green chili actually put some on it. I ordered extra and they charge a fortune for a side of it. Used to be 5* for me but seems to be headed the wrong direction."}
{"text":"Great food.  Bisquits and Gravy and things with green chili super tasty.  Only reason for 4 starts is that service was slow.  They need to work on getting food out faster than 30 min."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast this morning. I had the French toast and a scrambled egg. The egg was not cooked enough in my opinion. The waitress was really busy, and never came back to see how our food was. The French toast was just ok. I get that people like this because it has that local small town homemade feel to it, but I am not going back. Service was meh, food just ok, if that, and it is super loud."}
{"text":"This is a good breakfast place with some hearty, breakfast choices. Their pancakes are HUMONGOUS. This location & the other on Lindsay are ALWAYS busy. food is worth it,but do be prepared to not get here when your appetites are already raging. It's taken close to 30 minutes for our food once we placed our orders....so yeaaaaa"}
{"text":"We had great service (a waitress named Stacey) and a lovely meal, but I had one major complaint. The food was decent, but tasted like it was a day old. The potatoes were slightly on the cold side and the hollandiase sauce had a twang, like it was just about to turn.  Overall, it was good.....for leftovers. I really feel when paying 10-12 dollars a plate, we should have fresh food.  I would return.  Certainly, a charming little place worth a second chance."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and very good.  They make their own breakfast sausages, very tasty.  Our server did a great job getting everything we needed."}
{"text":"The food here is soooo good!  The pancakes are massive, bigger than the plate!  I had a scramble one day and the Cali Eggs Benedict on another day.  So good!  Their biscuits and gravy are divine! You've got to try the chorizo gravy, what flavor!  It's not spicy just sinfully good. Mmm, I want some again right now!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my family and have never had such bad service like I had today. Brought my mom for breakfast and we went ahead and sat down it took about 15 min for someone to acknowledge we were sitting here. We then ordered coffe and took another 10 min to get coffee and a menu. After ordering our food (nothing complicated) it must have taken a good 35 minutes before we got our food. Not to mention as I looked over to two other tables those customers had arrived after we did yet they had gotten their food served and we're already enjoying it. Bad bad service not sure if it was the waitress  (which I will not mention her name) or what."}
{"text":"Any restaurant that creates an 18\" inch pancake is near and dear to my heart. That's enough to get five stars from me, let alone that fact the service was solid on a Saturday morning and the wait time was virtually zero. The black coffee they served here was incredibly strong, just the way I like it. My friend  Pablo had the lumberjack breakfast and walked away feeling very satisfied until lunch time. I'd definitely eat here again. The place is located near Riverview Park, the Tempe mall, and the Natural History Musuem, so dining here led to a day of fun times. Mom's Pancakes - the fabled 18 inchers - are well worth trying. They even have a to go box to accommodate it! That got a smile from me. I was asking as a joke but they delivered."}
{"text":"Food was great we came on a Sunday so like most break places it was packed. The wait was pretty short."}
{"text":"I came here around 7 am ish with the bf. I was super hungry and yelped for good breakfast around chandler/Gilbert area. I found henhouse cafe! I read the reviews and it says it's the best breakfast place in this area. Well they were absolutely right! Bf had chicken and waffles and I had their omelet with wheat sour dough. It was delicious. Everything was so fresh and tasty! Loved it with some fresh orange juice. Friendly waitresses too will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I got the Texas Benedict and it was awesome. My wife got a blueberry, lemon pancake with mascarpone cheese and she loved it. The side of potatoes seemed a little plain compared to the main dish, maybe some peppers and onions would help. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I just got back from a trip around Arizona & New Mexico. On that trip we ate out every meal and tried the best restaurants according to yelp in all the cities we stopped in. Some were good, others were not so great but none were amazing enough to be memorable. After the trip, we stopped in to Henhouse Cafe for breakfast, not expecting much. However, we were happily surprised, the Santa Fe omlet was the best I'd had in a long time and the pancakes were gigantic and not bad either. All in all, out of all the places on my trip, this was the only one great enough to be memorable.   4/24/2017- French toast is better than most places, however it's a little expensive at $7 for the portion, 2 pieces of normal sized bread cut in half with no sides. That being said, the other options like any of their huge pancakes or the Santa Fe omlet are still amazing."}

{"text":"Ok, kind of bland. Maybe everyone is too new yet. Don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"First time here. Really enjoyed their waffles and the bacon was very crispy. Definitely worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Hubcap pancakes. Homemade syrup. Very tasty. Friendly service. Reasonable prices. Good cup of joe. Nice little cafe for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is one of my few \"go to\" breakfast destinations. I gladly bring friends and family here. The food is delicious, the restaurant is clean, and the staff is prompt and kind. The food portions are great and you have good variety to choose from."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and service. Owners are keeping there quality and menu to there newest location. Best if luck will be back soon"}
{"text":"We happened to be in this area and gave this place a try for breakfast. It did not disappoint. I had the crab omelette special and my husband had the diabolical breakfast. Good portions, great food, cute atmosphere and reasonable prices. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolute zoo. Tried to check this place out, 4 adults, couldn't even get to hostess to put our name in because staff all too busy visiting with friends blocking entry. Turned around and left. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Better than the Farmhouse in Gilbert downtown. Pancakes are huge and sausage are homemade."}
{"text":"Slow service by server. Waited 20 minutes for food and when it came it was cold Food nothing to brag about. Informed manager but he didn't seem to care if I was coming back or not. Save your money. Far better service at I-hop and food at I hop was much better and not cold."}
{"text":"Perfect. Great food. Nice nice server named Misa. Highly recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Every time we eat here we have been amazed! We love trying the specials; today was the hot chocolate pancakes. They were amazing! The servers are always kind & do a great job."}
{"text":"Every visit is consistently great. Today I had the strawberry cheesecake french toast. It was amazing!!! Mitch, our server was extremely attentive and very nice. Our experience was exceptional."}
{"text":"Another first since moving to Gilbert. Having breakfast at the Henhouse is a nice way to spend a Saturday morning. Friendly staff and good food are a great combination. The portion sizes are huge!  Pancakes are the size of a dinner plate.  Hubby had a huge portion of biscuits and gravy, which he enjoyed. I had a delicious veggie omelet and fried potatoes. My only disappointment was no gluten free options for toast. I asked for sliced tomato since I couldn't have toast and was told it would be 99 cents.   Not cool. We will probably go back, but I will look for other places that do have a GF option."}
{"text":"Went to the one in Gilbert. Finally being able to get in it's always so crowded. I've been to the one in Mesa lovely experience. And I have no concerns with Gilbert my waitress was very generous very nice very attentive. The restaurant is a little small so I felt a little cramped in but other than that the food was delicious and the service was great this would be a restaurant that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for a while now as I drive by it frequently. This morning I was hankering for a breakfast burrito so I did what any Yelpster would do, I asked Yelp for a good breakfast burrito. The Henhouse Cafe came up as one of my choices. Say no more I was there. This place is big enough to accommodate a large hungry weekend crowd. It is nicely decorated with a country theme. The wait staff all wear t-shirts that say \"A rooster crows, but a hen delivers\". The place was about half full on a Saturday morning. I was seated immediately. It did take a few minutes for our waitress to arrive. I got my coffee and ordered my breakfast burrito. They charged an extra 49 cents to add jalapenos. The meal was out in a reasonable amount of time. The burrito consisted of scrambled eggs, sausage, green and red bell peppers, onions, potatoes, cheese, and the jalapenos i ordered. All this was stuffed into a large flour tortilla. It came with a side of salsa. I couldn't finish it all. It was one of the best breakfast burritos I've had in a while. The price was reasonable, the service ok, the food excellent. There will be a return trip in the future."}
{"text":"l I didn't post pictures because with 200+ photos, you get the picture. I stopped in on a Friday morning with 5 other guys. A large crowd of people had just left so being seated wasn't a problem. This restaurant was kind of plain Jane if you ask me. They have a modest country décor, high ceilings, and a glass window store front. The breakfast menu consists of standard breakfast items.  I ordered the breakfast burrito. While I was waiting I thought the table next to us had ordered a pizza. I was actually a pancake the size of a pizza. They took the leftovers in what looked like a pizza box. My burrito arrived in a reasonable amount of time. It contained eggs, bacon, peppers, potatoes, and cheese, wrapped in a large flour tortilla. This came with a side of salsa. The burrito was good. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. The only complaint I have is that I only got 2 cups of coffee during the course of the meal. I believe in order to earn 4-5 stars a restaurant should never let your coffee cup be empty."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this restaurant despite Google map directions. First time here. Ordered the Carntas Burro that had scrambled eggs, potato, carnitas, and cheese. The breakast burro was smothered in a green chili sauce. It was perfectly seasoned. Ate half for breakfast and half for lunch.   They have lots of menu selections. Place is clean and  has a country motif. Got there at about 6:45 a.m. They had one server intially and two arrived later. The two servers that arrived later spent most of their time talking to each other behind the counter. Guess they thought these customers  are not my customers...so why should I walk around with a coffee pot or help the one server who was working hard but falling a bit behind.  Pretty noticeable to a first time customer. Not sure if any of the three were managers or owners but the front end requires better team work so the customer can be better served with a quality dining experience. They missed that opportunity.  The food quality is excellent. The menu prices on Yelp are not the same as the actual menu prices so be aware of that when you go there."}
{"text":"Found this by mistake. Had to wait for a ride after my dr apt and it looks like there is nothing but open fields near my dr.  So I figured I would look to find the closest whatever and hang out there. Hoping for a cup of coffee, I saw the hen house right across the street.  And I'm so glad I did. It's a very homey feel to it and just fabulous! Food!  The portions are huge for the prices. It always looks busy and everyone smiling. I have to drive about 40 min from my house to get here, but quality like this is hard to find so I will drive... Had a blueberry pancake today and are you kidding me! Bigger then my head lol. Amazing!"}
{"text":"We had a minimal wait time for a busy Saturday morning and the staff was very friendly.  I had the Florentine Benedict and it was good, no complaints.  But what really got me drooling was actually my husband's Chicken & Waffles with the spicy syrup.  Super yummy!"}
{"text":"OMG, this place has the best breakfast ever! We stumbled upon this place while looking to eat a quick breakfast before attending a wedding in Phoenix and was so impressed that I came back the second day. I ordered the Strawberry and White Chocolate Chip pancake and also the breakfast sandwich which came on a biscuit. The fried chicken in the sandwich was the most tender and moist fried chicken I've ever had. The pancake size was bigger than my head and it could easily be shared between 3-4 people. I love this place! Please open one in LA!!"}
{"text":"Great family breakfast spot!  Nothing fancy inside, just delicious food!  You've got to try their famous pancakes!  They are huge and also very good!  Also tried the CA eggs Benedict and it was all very yummy!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am vegetarian, and eat egg whites because egg yolk and meat make me sick. I was told this place does not serve egg whites, and I was confused because I got those last time I ate here. I told the waitress that egg yolk makes me sick, and a neighboring customer chimed in to inform me of the chicken egg shortage.   I asked, can't you remove the yolk? They said \"no\" and \"we are very busy\", and the waitress said I can speak wth the manager. At this point the neighboring customers and few workers were listening in and watching, I felt uncomfortable and left. Couldn't but wonder, is this everywhere in AZ? We have no problems in California.  I wanted to see and called a nearby restaurant (4 minutes away from this place) and the manager said they serve egg whites, and removing the yolk was easy and possible to do. Why couldn't the Henhouse do the same? Do they serve egg beaters or some other egg alternative, hindering them to do so? I wouldn't know cause I only got \"no\" and \"we can't\" and \"we are busy\" and the final \"you can speak to our manager\".  My advice to the restaurant: Please post on your menu - WE DO NOT SERVE EGG WHITES - To avoid costumers feeling put in the spot. Please don't make them feel like they have to explain why they can't eat something, certainly in front of other costumers.   FYI: OTHER CLOSE RESTAURANTS SERVE EGG WHITES, JUST CALL"}
{"text":"One of the better breakfasts in Gilbert.  The best pancakes in town, for sure!  I've had three of their egg dishes and they were up to expectations.  Hopefully they have consistency, as many breakfast restaurants miss the mark after a few visits...  Hoping to call this place \"home\" for the next while:)"}
{"text":"Second visit to Henhouse since it opened last month.  Both times business has been pretty brisk but no wait to be seated and the food arrived pretty fast.  Green chili skillet was really good as was the chicken fried steak. Not a total fan of the potatoes but I think that is just personal preference.  Staff was friendly, prices were pretty reasonable.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Although it was not a typical Cuban sandwich it was still very tasty. The portions are giant! The bloody Mary was pretty good too. My daughter loved her cheesy eggs and French toast. The juevos rancheros wasdelicious and giant!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and we really liked it eggs fresh and cooked right thick good quality bacon and sausage yummy French toast a good cup of coffee and nice friendly service we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Visited on mother's day and even with the line outside we were seated right away. Guess sometimes it pays  to have a small party of two."}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! How this breakfast place doesn't have 5 stars I can't understand!! This place was highly recommended to have huge servings, best food made from scratch & incredible service! We have tried everywhere & only have one other place we swear by. Huge servings you can't leave hungry!!! All obviously from scratch, BEST waffles, pancakes, omelets, skillets, potatoes, right amount of everything... WOW!! Couldn't improve anything! They use real butter not margarine, syrup is made from scratch (heated & served as needed), their own waffle/pancake mix, real potatoes seasoned to perfection & griddle cooked w/left over juices making them so authentic!"}
{"text":"Today we went to this place for the first time. Nothing special... I always thought that place must be something outstanding, considering they always have lots of people lining up there every Sunday morning.We thought they must give something away or something. Well, the service was just Ok. The guy wasn't rude or anything, but he wasn't friendly either. Had kind of sourpuss face throughout the whole thing. Made me kind of uncomfortable. We, Americans, are spoiled when it comes to service. We want to see a smile on the face of a person who serves you food and wants to earn tip. Anyway that was that! As far as food goes, it was blend, and lacking flavor. I had an omelette with potatoes, ham and bacon. It was salt free totally. I am not a salt lover, but me, saying it was not salty enough, means it was NO salt whatsoever. I had to pour ketchup all over it to get any kind of flavor. Anyway we won't be back. Go to Denny's if you want good breakfast and good service cheap."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times unfortunately because other people in my family enjoy it, but I have NEVER had a good experience. The wait is ridiculously long for sub-par food. The service is slow and often inaccurate. I once listened to my server talk to another server for five to ten mins while we waited for refills of our drinks.  On top of the bad service, they refuse to make changes to meals. Want fries instead of their undercooked potatoes? Too bad. They won't make those for you in the morning.  Want a side of French toast instead of the two sides that come with the meal you want?  Too bad. You can add it on top of the cost of everything else and they'll leave the other food off, but that's as good as it gets.  I understand items cost different amounts, but I have never had a place outright refuse to make changes unless it's clearly stated on the menu for specific \"combination plates\"."}
{"text":"I have been to this location before and was satisfied with the service and food.  That being said, we made the mistake of showing up around 11am on Mother's Day this year.  BIG BIG MISTAKE.  We asked how long was the wait for first available table...we were told 30 minutes.  So we decided to wait, and didn't get a table on the patio for 45 minutes.  On our way to the patio, the server stated that the kitchen was backed up and that our food would not arrive for another hour.  Wow.  I wish they had told us when we first showed up that we actually would not have food for an HOUR AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES.  Oh well...we were commited by this time, so we went out to the patio and waited for food for a solid hour by the clock.  Our meals finally arrived, and they were good.  We had a taco salad, a southwestern salad, and a veggie omelet.  HOWEVER, in order to take the heat off of families with impatient children, the staff set up a bean bag toss right next to our table, which was great for the kids but was inconsiderate to people who had been waiting for breakfast for a while.  Couldn't they set this up at the entrance to the restaurant instead?  Finally, this has nothing to do with the service or food, but the plants on the patio are DEAD.  Either get rid of the METAL planters (this is ARIZONA) or replace the plants with high quality silk or plastic plants.  The dead plants make the place look totally neglected.  I will probably return for the food when they are less busy, but I will NEVER come here again on Mother's Day.  PS: They comp'ed our non-alcoholic drinks due to the wait.  PPS:  They need to turn on the patio misting system and/or install an awning over the patio ASAP.  PPPS:  They should probably get rid of the sign on the door advertising for a restaurant manager or cooks.  It's definitely a red flag of BAD things to come."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed henhouse for the last year or so but today was awful. The wait to sit wasn't bad.  And it's to be expected anyway in Gilbert. But the wait for our food - that was (and has always been) extremely long. You guys also got rid of two classic delicious items. Grits. And shredded hash browns. What gives? Our waitress seemed annoyed to even be there. Scrambled \"eggs\" seemed to be beaters. Bacon was soggy. My husbands order was wrong. Overall - not good and we won't be back. So many other delicious places to go for a $30 breakfast."}
{"text":"This a great new breakfast place that my parents and I discovered.  They don't have a huge selection, but what they do have is unique and interesting.  In each category they have an item that meets a specific taste (spicy, sweet, healthy, down home).  I had the Cali Benedict.  Their hollandaise sauce is on point and the egg was poached perfectly.  The flavors blended together well.  Dad had the Country Benedict which was basically biscuits and gravy with poached eggs.  The server told us that the sausage patties were hand crafted.  And they were super flavorful and delicious. Some of the best sausage I have ever tasted.  Mom had the French Toast which was made with Hawaiian bread.  Also very delicious and not overly sweet.  Great food coupled with friendly staff makes this a great choice for breakfast or brunch.  We will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"We went for the first time today after a friend raved about this place. We were sat immediately, and the entire wait staff was very friendly. The decor is nice - spacious, clean, and just the right amount of kitschy. We did wait a while (30 minutes) for our food, there was some miscommunication between the waitress' printer and the cook, but they were up front about it, and the food was so delicious; definitely worth the wait! Boyfriend got the kitchen sink omelette, I got the Texas Benedict, and we split the strawberry cheesecake French toast.  Boyfriend loved his freshly squeezed orange juice so much he paid for the refills.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite, so I had hopeful expectations. The Hen House did not disappoint! Love the decore, the service was friendly and the food was delicious.  I ordered my usual, Chicken Fried Steak. The gravy was one of the best I've had.  The only bad thing is we are just passing through Chandler and can't make this place our \"go to\"."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Ask for your potato's crispy. If you like Biscuits and gravy, they do it well. Good coffee."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this cozy family owned resturant.  We actually left Ihop as we sat at table for a long time without being served.  The staff at Henhouse Cafe is very friendly, our service was very good.  We were surprised at how much food we received and each of us were pleased with the homemade taste.  If you are looking for a friendly, cozy place with very good food, please check this place out.  You won't regret it.  They are only open until 2 and they serve breakfast and lunch.  Be sure to look for the cards on the table that you can text them and get a dollar off your meal."}
{"text":"We had breakfast there this morning and have nothing but awesome things to say about it! We got there a little after it opened at 6:45am and by the time we left at about 7:30am, it was almost full, which definitely says something about it. My fiancé had the chicken fried steak and biscuits and gravy and it was some of the best he's had in the valley. Also, their homemade sausage is fantastic. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. We've been trying new restaurants all over the east valley and have only found a few that we would go back to and this is definitely one of them."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place I have ever been to hands down. Great Coffee,  Juice.  Best food and menu selections.  If you can't find anything you like in this menu.  You don't know what you are missing."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 0 if i had to ! Wow!!! Placed my food for pick up at 11:45got my food at 12:30 ! Worst service ever was offered a glass of water while I waited half an hour for my food. Ohh btw after all the delay a side  MAYONNAISE is an up charge ! Such a ridiculous place will never come here again ! I cater from a lot of places in Gilbert and was never treated like the ! BEWARE dont come here!!!  It's sad they don't care for keeping good  customers."}
{"text":"Vibe is great, food is good.  I ordered Chicken Fried Chicken, it was great!  The batter on the chicken is crispy and taste delicious. We also ordered the 18 inch pancake.  We brought 12 people and are not able to finish..."}
{"text":"First time here today. Food was average. Coffee was constantly empty. My husband had a veggie omelet that when we got the bill was $14!!  Insane!!  Ask about up charges before you order."}
{"text":"A nice local family owned experience. Good staff and good food. I typically don't like going out for breakfast but I can see this place becoming a regular for us"}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with their breakfast. Everything tastes homemade. So glad we found it."}
{"text":"How this has a 3.5 star rating is beyond me... The only thing in history that has been more disappointing is the architecture of the Death Star to allow one shot through a vent destroy the entire thing. Seriously amazing! Strawberry cheesecake French toast is a must or at least the crunchy French toast."}
{"text":"I ordered the chorizo omelette and it was amazing. My girlfriend ordered the cali benedict and she couldnt get enough of it! The food is great and the service is amazing. The restraunt has a \"homey\" feel to it."}
{"text":"I always get a great breakfast here.  Superior staff and ownership shows.   We eat lunch here often."}
{"text":"Went there this morning for breakfast with some friends. The wait wasn't too long so that's good. The service was pretty terrible. I ordered the tamale plate but was told they didn't have it available. Would of been nice if that was notated on the menu or told to us by the server. I ordered just a simple classic breakfast and was unable to substitute out the potatoes. My scrambled eggs were more brown than yellow so they were pretty much inedible and the potatoes were just awful and bland. The syrup they use is kind of weird so brace yourself for a sugar bomb. Probably won't be back unless it's to try lunch."}
{"text":"Rule #1 of waiting: do not make your table wait on their check. And worst, when we hand you our card before you bring the check, do not tell us to hold on so we can see it first. We trust you entered things right and we want to go!   Other than that, pancakes are delicious and gigantic. I love their breakfast potatoes and the southwest biscuits and gravy are tasty. I would like to see a chorizo scramble on the menu (something with green chilies, tomatoes, onion, cheese). There is one scramble with chorizo but it was beans in it which is not my style.  Overall if you are looking to a decent home style breakfast hen house is a decent pick in gilbert"}
{"text":"The food was good. Skimpy on the gravy for the biscuits and gravy. The potatoes were a bit bland. The service was not so good. Tried my wifes pancakes, were very good. After ordering we waited 15 minutes when the waitress came back to our table and asked us what we ordered AGAIN...  Another 15 minutes went by before we finally got our food."}
{"text":"Ive been hearing great things about this place for a long time. Recently, I took my mom there for breakfast. It was super packed, but luckily all the parties waiting were large so we got seated quickly.  The restaurant itself was very quaint and had a \"home\" feel to it. There was plenty of seating inside and outside. The waitress seemed to be pretty side tracked and that's where Henhouse lost the star for me. We waited awhile for drinks, refills, and even the check. Aside from this lets talk about the food...  I got the Chicken fried steak with the chorizo gravy and OMG was it bomb diggity. It came with potatoes and 2 eggs. It was the perfect amount of chow. My mom got eggs, bacon and potatoes, and wanted a pancake... This pancake came out and it was 3 times the size of her head. It was Gigantic. She loved all the food, and was impressed on how good the pancake tasted. As we walked out she said \"lets come back here soon\". Definitely a place that has to be checked out for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place.  If you don't mind waiting a little while when you get there.  Once your seated the service is exceptional.  Went with my family, everyone loved their selection.  I had the fried chicken and waffles.  Delicious.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast place. Great food great service. We will be back. Worth the wait for a solid breakfast."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday morning with family.  It was very busy and we were given a 25 min wait time.  We sat outside for no more than 5 min before we were given a table.  Nice.  The decor is very cute country farmhouse. They have limited seating inside, with a little bar-top type seating; and some tables outside.  They had spring specials including some Irish themed items for St. Patty's Day like apple pancakes.  I ordered the croissant sandwich with fried potatoes.  Super delicious with the house made sausage patty being the star.  My family ordered the Strawberry Cheescake stuffed french toast and the blueberry lemon marscapone pancake. They were very pleased.  We also ordered the beignets that came with a berry sauce for the table, they were worth the wait. We also witnessed the Mom's pancake being taken to a table behind us-it's the size of a family sized pizza. Wow! I do wish they had their beverages listed on their menu, and that they had more coffee options.  They do have fresh squeezed oj, which was very tasty. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. When I'm back in town, I will definitely request breakfast be here!"}
{"text":"Crab Cake Benedict is what you need. Make the \"mistake\" of ordering Mom's pancake. Ask for the pizza box to take it home."}
{"text":"It just amazed me how so many annoying things were happening to My Parents and I as soon as we arrived. When we walked in, smelled really delicious. I was so confident in this place for My Parents and I, since I'm always trying to find new places for us to try. We were in the area and hadn't had breakfast yet, so we stopped in for Brunch. The annoying thing was; which I think the restaurant CAN add/change is; to make sure someone is at the front AT ALL TIMES. We had people walk in behind us that got seated before us. There were (3) of us and people of (4) got seated before us. When we finally got seated, we tried ordering our drinks. Our personal preferences is Coke products. They only have Pepsi products. Just to \"us\", it was a turn off. I ordered the Pepsi product, My Pop's ordered a small Orange Juice instead. The waiter says they only have ONE size of Orange Juice and that it comes in a Large. So My Dad orders a Large Orange Juice. My Mom tried ordering a cup of water with no ice, and was informed they don't have room temp water. This may sound really dumb to you; but to us, our brains just shut off. (laughs) We absolutely did not know how to respond to that. We looked at each other like \"WHUTT?!\" He said they get hot water and use a lot of ice. That sh*t was just weird to us. So... My Mom ordered no water. When the waiter brought our beverages, he brings My Dad a small Orange Juice. We were shocked. My Dad shook his head \"This is a Large?\" I compared my drink to his and we all expected his Orange Juice to be as Large as My Diet Pepsi. Tricked. When looking at the menu, everything sounded delicious, but seemed like they charged for every little thing. We almost didn't want to stay because things seemed to go very slow for us; trying to get seated, if My Mom should or should not order hot water to drink, going over a very loopy menu and My Dad's Large Small Orange Juice. My Parents almost walked out and leaving me there, I reminded them it just might be good. They sat down, chose what they wanted, and we ended up waiting ten minutes for someone to finally see us to take our order. My Dad was so frustrated. He couldn't believe how there were so many workers and every one of them were walking past us, over looking us, over servicing other people, constantly walking by us to go outside to their patio area AND their computer area. And STILL no one came. Finally our waiter came over, took our order and left. We glanced around the restaurant; it was nice, clean, had neat little trinkets on the wall (very Country Kitchen like), ect. My Mom was getting very thirsty and decided she'll order her hot water with ice. At first, it was hard to find our waiter. Next, it was hard to catch our waiter. By this time, it was no longer crowded so, where did he go? When we gave up, then he shows up. He brought her water then disappeared again. Someone else brought our food and then left without asking us if we needed anything else. We wanted Jam for our toast and more napkins. My Dad didn't want to bother getting anything else for he was already upset; but I knew he likes Jam on his toast so I was going to get his Jam. At this point, I was getting very irritated. I stopped someone for Jam and he happily gave it to me. All these reviews say the food is great, but I'm writing because the service was pretty sh*tty. It was not that busy nor crowded for us to be over-looked THAT many times. We were seated in a heavy foot traffic area for the staff, and none of them stopped or looked our way to see if we were alright. We believed the manager strolled by asking us if we were enjoying ourselves. We all shrugged and said Yeah (because we were exhausted and done trying to get someones attention). Our waiter was hardly there and had so much confidence in himself that he serviced us entirely when he didn't. He only took our order and brought our beverages, and never brought our food, extra napkins, Jam, refills, to get our finished plates out of the way, and our to-go boxes. He never even came by to collect payment. Walking through the parking lot, we were fed up with the service and had wished we went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Choosing from the menu was difficult because there were so many options that looked amazing! I ended up choosing the chicken fried steak and my husband chose the tamale plate. The food was delicious! The portion size is huge (way too much for me), but the price was very reasonable! We are definitely coming back some time soon to try more items from the menu. My compliments to the chef!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I had a Belgian waffle with a side of potatoes and bacon. The potatoes were good although bland and needed seasoning. Not sure if they do that to cater to different people's taste to season to their liking. I loved the waffle! It's a good size and they powder it with powdered sugar. My only complaint was the waiter was rude. After we paid he got the check and he said \"that's it? No tip? Well, thanks a lot. That's cool\". I went to eat with family and they treated and I saw them put the tip... Im not sure if he felt unsatisfied with what he got and wanted more or somehow it blew away? I mean we did sit outside... It makes no sense. We ended up forking another five dollars which he didn't sound quite grateful for. The other staff seemed very nice though. Despite this experience I'll come back. Maybe next time I'll triple count or even photograph the money I put in for the check as evidence... good food and clean environment so I'd reccomend it."}
{"text":"Wow! First time visiting this place and I was blown away!  Following many recommendations here, I knew I wanted something with their chorizo sausage. What better than the Chorizo Omelette, which was spectacular.  I'd been torn between that and the Biscuits & Gravy (I crave comfort food) with the chorizo sausage gravy. Fortunately my sister ordered that and I had a taste and it was exceptional.  Gotta give a shout out to KELLI who made our breakfast great. She explained the menu and offered suggestions (and confirmed our choices). Plus my coffee cup never went empty! She totally made the morning.  Unfortunately ... I live in Florida which is 2,100 miles from the Hen House. But I'll be back in October on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Had a breakfast date with a friend. Neither of us had been here before. Wasn't blown away but it was definitely good eating. Would go back for sure. There pancakes are INSANELY huge though!!! One would be enough for a family"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best for breakfast! The food tastes like home made. I love this place."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. We came here because of all the great reviews, expecting to be disappointed. We we're not. This food is SO FLIPPING GOOD!! The pricing is similar to what you will find at Denny's but the food is WAY better."}
{"text":"Where to start...um these folks need a bigger space because Henhouse is off the charts!!!  Worlds largest pancake, see pic, and it actually taste amazing!   Fresh scrambled eggs were spot on!  Thick bacon cooked perfect, not too soft not to hard...this isn't cheap bacon either!  House made sausage is my favorite breakfast sausage to date, in fact, everyone at my table set aside the awesome bacon to devour the #banginSausge!   OJ in cool mugs, great coffee, laid back atmosphere, great waitstaff, and did I mention the XtLrg Pizza box for the to go pancake?!?   Crazy  Oh, and the chicken n waffles, yeah, the chicken n waffles!!!!  Everything was great, my new favorite breakfast spot...great job henhouse!  Btw, my teenage son couldn't finish his plate....that has never happened lol"}
{"text":"Update from 8/2016: - Food is still solid but the attitude of the staff leaves a lot to be desired.  Beau the GM is a bit of a kiss ass, but given the lack of follow up by the staff, I can see that it's needed.  - We were there with friends and in particular the girl Rhea needs to be knocked down a peg or two.  Just has a stank attitude and seems to have many personal issues to resolve and brings them to the restaurant.  If she's going to talk trash about people in the restaurant she probably should be aware that this is a small town and people know each other.  We were at the counter and she was talking bad about a couple of our friends sitting in the restaurant.  Seriously unprofessional.  - It's a shame that this once great restaurant and local success story has fallen off.  Outside of the friend that wants to go, we likely won't be back."}
