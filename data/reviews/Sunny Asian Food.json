{"text":"Very clean, amazing selection of Indian groceries, and the kitchen in the back where they serve fresh Indian cuisine is excellent.  The owners are very friendly and helpful. A true gem of a place; hands down the best Indian store in Ohio."}
{"text":"I got Chicken Tikka Masala, naan and rice, to go, for $10.50.  They have a buffet Monday through Saturday, 11:30-3.    I was actually going to be Chipotle across the lot when I saw this place. I thought - Asia Market, I can get some fried noodles and hibachi chicken or something.  Nope. It's Indian food.  As a reminder, India is not in England,  It's in Asia.  So Lamb Biryani is indeed Asian food.  And Egg Foo Yung is from Independence, Missouri.  A guy came out from the kitchen, and I must have had a stupid, confused look on my face because he basically ordered for me.  I wanted the goat curry, but he said -you're having Chicken Tikka Masala and Naan.  I further weakened their impression of me by requesting chopsticks.  The Naan was especially good.  Very often, you get thin, crispy naan.  This was thick and almost gooey in the center.  Best I've had in a while.  A little garlic and ghee rubbed on it and I'd have been happy with just that."}
{"text":"Everybody there is so nice, and you always find what you are looking for. On top of that they have indian clothes for everybody. The designs and quality is amazing, and if you need something fixed they happily help fulfill your need. Lastly, the food they serve is palatable. It is fresh and handmade, so if you are looking for authentic indian food that's the place to go. They have a lot of seats ready so the whole family can sit after all of that shopping and enjoy a delicous meal. Going to sunny's Asian foods and spices is a sneaky way for parents to spend time with their kids! Happy shopping!"}
{"text":"Well stocked place for your favorite Asian provisions. Fresh, packaged, frozen, they've got most anything you might be looking for. Excellent spice collection, and they even have a small restaurant in the back of the store. I'll have to return and try it out, didn't have time that day. The location is convenient off 422 at Rte 91 and Aurora Road (43)."}
{"text":"You wouldn't know that some great food is hidden in this small gem of a grocery store. There's a small restaurant in the back with a nice menu and lunch time buffet. Fresh, delicious, authentic Indian food for Veg and non-veg. It's my go-to at least once a week."}
{"text":"Wonderful variety of Indian products in the grocery part of the store.  The employees are very warm and friendly.  The restaurant in the back of the store has delicious food!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS TINY LITTLE HIDDEN GEM!  IF YOU'RE A FAN OF INDIAN FOOD THEN GIVE SUNNY ASIAN A TRY!       This place is actually hard to find nestled in large open shopping area and next door to Jo-Ann Fabrics.  Once you find it though, you have your choices of Indian food dishes that are easy to make from a box, instant, frozen or you get to choose your ingredients and make it yourself.  It's up to you.  Either way, it's up to you and there is just about everything Indian here.      Wait though, that's not all they have!  Hiding past the aisles is a small, cozy little dine in spot specializing in vegetarian dishes for Indian food that are reasonably priced!  The only issue I had honestly was that the owners are definitely Middle Eastern and have some trouble with English but it did not bother me and the food was delicious!        Overall, I give this place 4 stars because it is hard at times to find something in particular if you're looking for it but a GREAT little shop for Indian/Middle Eastern food and a wonderful little place to eat for lunch!"}
{"text":"Inside this humble little grocery store, you'll find the most authentic Indian food in Cleveland. It's unfortunate that no one knows about this place and have not made it popular yet. I had the best chole bhature I have had in a long time. Their Pakodas were equally authentic. Oh and I packed their aloo, gobhi and mooli paratha which were all to die for. The food is prepared by a Punjabi family and is really authentic! Do visit."}
