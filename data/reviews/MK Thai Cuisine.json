{"text":"Was in town for a bit of business and pleasure; MK Thai definitely fit the latter. The tempura shrimp appetizer was appropriately prepared and came with a delicate but flavorful plum sauce. The entrees were the standouts, though. My wife's Panang beef and my Chili paste chicken were both outstanding. Service was friendly and prompt. Do not hesitate the leave the bubble of the strip or your resort to seek out this gem."}
{"text":"Very delicious ! I had the traditional curry (pronounced pa-nay) , shrimp chow mein, spring rolls , and seafood salad. 

My favorite was the traditional curry with tofu. I am picky with Thai food but this place is worth a try. Kind of in a rough neighborhood but oh well!!"}
{"text":"Called in for pick up tonight. Still AWESOME! Way to go you guys. Thank you for all your hard work"}
{"text":"I don't know if it was my luck, but I tried this place on a to go order and it was disrespectful what I got. I ordered the Tom yum shrimp soup (which is the only thing I always order in other Thai restaurants) so I know exactly how it should taste and look. When I opened the container you could clearly see how old the mushrooms and the shrimp were, even after seeing that, I gave it a try, but you could still taste  the mushrooms were super bad and old.. Just plain disgusting. I would never bash a business for a minor thing. But this time I felt disrespected and yes, that's how bad was it! If you can't afford fresh ingredients, please don't run a business."}
{"text":"Great tasting amazing portions for the little price you pay they have a scale on 1-10 on spiceyness and the pad see ew is on point one of my favorites in town now !"}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant on Father's Day and this restaurant will become a family tradition for us. The Yellow Curry was the best my sister-in-law has ever had and the soups are just great here. It is definitely a place to come to. Great staff and cooks!"}
{"text":"This is the first review I wrote in yelp because this is sooooooo good! This is the best ever Thai food I have been tasted.  Today's lunch special is crying tiger, so delicious! The juicy steak with the secret Thai sauce, amazing match! And the staff here is friendly and nice to answer your any questions! Lol"}
{"text":"Eggplant and tofu was excellent 
Fresh rolls lots of lettuce was great
Enjoyed all off our choices"}
{"text":"I came here many times. All food and services were excellent, especially crap fried rice. Truly amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Went in to try the place out since I had lived in the area for a while and didn't notice it. I went in on a Tuesday for their sweet and sour chicken special and boy was I disappointed.  Although the only  waitress did a decent job of serving a small rush of 6 tables, the food was sub par.  The food was cold and tasted rather old. The chicken seemed as if it had been cooked and held in the warmer and the vegetables were not crisp somewhat wilted. The only thing that seemed hot was the sweet and sour sauce. I'm not sure if it was because the server took to long to bring out our food or if it was just my luck but I was let down. I may have to try this place for their dinner hours, hopefully it redeems itself."}
{"text":"Quite yummy!  In Vegas for a convention, and picked up some goodies here.  We had pot stickers, crab rangoons, pineapple rice, and orange chicken.  My only complaint is that we ordered the spiciest medium, and it seemed like there was no heat to any of it.  Otherwise, everything was tasty!

The staff was very friendly when we went in to pick up our food."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I'm just now finding out about this place! I have lived so close to MK pretty much all of my life and never knew about them until my girlfriend and I just found them on yelp.  Mikki is just so friendly and genuine and her level of service was amazing.  This place is just such a hidden gem.

We had the green curry with chicken which had bamboo shoots, eggplant, and I believe spinach.  It was rich and creamy and had a slight mint after taste which was refreshing (I'm not a big fan of mint in food so this is saying a lot lol).

We also had the kai prik pao which was their fried chicken in a sweet chili sauce.  We just had it mild but I'm assuming that you can get it Thai spicy if you want.  This dish was off the charts! I highly recommend getting it. The two dishes paired nicely with the crunch and spice from the chicken and the smooth, creamy-ness of the curry all over steamed rice.

It's a definite must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent Tom Kha and yellow curry. Also loved the fresh spring rolls. Service was impeccable. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened. Under new management for some time now, but the quality of the food never falters. The decor makes the place look kind of dirty (even though its not, its impeccable!) but the food and the service is wonderful! Pad Thai is to die for."}
{"text":"WHY DID THEY HAVE TO CLOSE DOWN?! I'm guessing they had bad management because this is seriously one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever eaten at. The food. Just. No words. So I love Chicken Panang Curry. This is the only restaurant to ever get it right. The chicken was all breast (meaning no fatty pieces at all), they actually included the lime keffir leaves and the bell peppers are always fresh. Everywhere else I go, there is always stuff missing or too much weird stuff added that changes the flavor. It's a damn shame. They sure had a cult following. The staff saw me so much for pick-ups and deliveries that they remembered my address so when I called in and got my panang (I must've been the only one that ordered it) they always knew. I'm crying for you M&K."}
{"text":"When it comes to 5 star rated Thai restaurants on Yelp, I pull no punches and go straight for traditional Thai dishes that never seem to satisfy my at most places.  One of those is pork Raad Nah (Lad Na), and that is what I ordered at MK today.  Well, that and crab rangoon of course, my white guy guilty pleasure.  

The crab rangoon was pretty good, nothing special, but yummy nonetheless.  The wonton was on the light and fluffy side, but otherwise uninspiring.  The cream cheese and imitation crab filling was well done, although a little fishy tasting from the imitation crab.  The sweet and sour sauce was a typical recipe, light in color and sweetness, and a little more tart than others.  All around though a yummy enough appetizer. 

The Raad Nah both impressed and disappointed.  Disappointed that they don't serve Chinese broccoli, but impressed by how good it was.   I think that maintaining fresh Chinese broccoli can be a big PITA for restaurants, especially one that might not cater to an Asian community (East Charleston).  So, I get that.  The Raad Nah came with American broccoli and sliced carrots, both of which were fresh and not overwhelming in flavor.  I think they were stewed for a bit to achieve that, but they weren't soggy in any way.  The gravy sauce was excellently prepared, although maybe slightly too thick for some traditionalists.  I enjoyed the balance of flavor and the thickness of it though.  The noodles were perfect, big thick flat noodles all stuck together in a dense mess.  That's how Raad Nah should be!  Big slices of pork that were tender and juicy topped the dish off.   If only this was served with Chinese broccoli!  

I plan on going back to this spot to try their curries and stir fries.  Fantastic service, great food so far, that's a winning combo for a Thai restaurant in this neighborhood.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and some of the best Thai we have ever had. Portions were very generous and the waitress took our leftover food and packed it up all nice to go. We will most definitely be eating here again when we come to Vegas next. Top notch Thai!"}
{"text":"What a little surprise! This place is in a corner of a shopping mall near the indoor swap meet and it is really good! I ordered the tom kah gai (chicken coconut soup) it was spicy and very flavorful! Then for entree I had chicken pad Thai and pineapple fried rice both were tasty and on point with the spice level I asked for. The service was fast and friendly and place was clean. I will definitely be back with some friends."}
{"text":"My friend suggested we met here for dinner.It's in a slightly shady part of town.But the service and the food are absolutely amazing!It is by far the best Thai food I have had.I recently became Vegan...so eating out is a challenge,but the spicy eggplant and tofu was gorgeous!Even my meat eating friend loved it.Our server was fantastic.Highly recommend it!Don't let the area put you off.We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My first time visit there and it was good! Food is tasty and service is fast and friendly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Was craving Thai food and found this place on Yelp. Definitely made my night! The lady who took my order was so nice, and the Pad Thai is definitely one of the best I've had. Out of the 10+ Thai restaurants I've been to in Vegas, this is now one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"This is one time I'm glad I listened to Yelpers. The food is amazing and seasoned well. Definitely hit the palate in all the right areas. The server was warm, and friendly. Go!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, affordable, as well. Outstanding service, loved our waitress! Exceptional restaurant, def a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Love the food and service.  Not the best part of town, and the store front location is unfortunate, but don't let that hold you back.  The staff is great, polite, helpful, and the food is authentically awesome.  It's our go-to Thai place on the east side of Vegas."}
{"text":"Apparently I received an apology call from this place due to my last review about the ice cream incident, I thought it was actually sweet and courteous of them to actually call me and apology then when I ordered from them again I have received a free green tea ice cream and sticky rice which was really delicious! Their customer service is amazing!"}
{"text":"MK Thai is a hidden gem on the northeast side of town. It has some of the best Thai food I've eaten. The lunch special is reasonably priced at $6.95--you get a different soup each time, two spring rolls and an entree with rice. 

My go-to favorite is the yellow curry. It's delicious and has just the right ratio of vegetables to chicken."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of thai restaurants and this place is by far one of the best thai food I ever eaten. Great service amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"Great food!
The yellow curry is amazing and so is the pad thai oh and can't forget about the pinapple fried rice so tasty and fresh. I eat here about once a week , the staff is friendly, I call in my order and pick it up within 15min, fast service with a smile."}
{"text":"The food is really great, service is amazing , it's a clean place, with a peaceful atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is a little out of the way as far as the Strip in concerned but well worth it. Great homemade food, portions are large so come hungry. We got the Crab Rangoon, Chicken Chow Mien,  Sweet & Sour Pork with white Rice. Great Food! We will come back"}
{"text":"If you want the absolute best Thai food in all of Nevada, mixed with the most amazing customer service then MK is a must have!"}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp for finding this place.  Nice portions, good price, GREAT Food.  I love my Thai Food spicy, when I order at other places they never get it hot enough from fear that I won't eat it. I told this place I wanted it as spicy as they could make it and got just what I wanted.  I ordered the spicy basil chicken and my partner had the yellow curry.  We left full and satisfied and are thinking of coming back for 2nd dinner :) Mickey the server was great and kept our drinks and rice full.  The 2 of us ate for $27 and we got an app, 2 entrées, and 2 sodas. A great deal!"}
{"text":"I finally found the one!!! 
Staff-very friendly and approachable! 

Place-looks clean. Located on charleston and lamb, near baskin robbins. I live closeby and the server said they have been there for 2 years. If it weren't for yelp, i wouldnt even have found out abt this place. And im sooo glad i did! Thank you yelp!!! Altho everytime i come there, there's always nobody or only 1 table is occupied (maybe people opt to take their food to go or they order by phone and pick up, like me, then eat at home) lol

Food- so so so good!! I must say, that in my 8 years living in las vegas, I finally found the thai restaurant who can make pad thai just perfectly(atleast for me)! On a level 3 spicy. Panang curry is sooo delish!!! Ugh. I just ate some and now im craving it again. 

Definitely the only restaurant ill get my thai fix from now on.."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The Tom yum Shrimp and Rom Yum chicken are very flavorful. Shrimp Drunken noodles are the best I had. You have to try the pineapple fried rice and Mongolian beef. We went here for Mother's Day and we had the whole restaurant to ourselves. Mostly people take-out food from here. The customer service was awesome. Our waitress was super friendly and we felt so comfortable. We love coming here."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner and the are closed, with a new name. Sushi and Sinaloa Food :-("}
{"text":"Simple but Great food. Had spicy basil and chicken cashew. Beef salad. Will be back. Very reasonable pricing. Great service."}
{"text":"I ordered spring rolls and Phad See- Ew, not many places in Vegas with good Thai food. It tasted really fresh it took a little while to get our food, but I can see why because the quality of the food was great. Our server was super sweet and friendly I'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"The only think that could use some improvement is the seating/ ordering arrangement. When you walk in you are not sure whether you should be seated or do you order at the counter like a taqueria. It makes things a little awkward... I actually went to the counter and ordered. The lady handed me a menu and I ordered there. Nothing a sign like, \"please let us seat you\" or \"please seat yourself.\" Or takeout orders at the counter. Small thing. The food was tasty with a good protein portion where as other places are not too liberal with the protein in the dish. I could tell this place was clean. 
Additionally, I had left overs that my waitress took from the table to package. That was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Randomly found this place since it was in the same parking lot as my gym. Cannot say I was disappointed! I walked in and it was empty but this place had great yelp reviews so I decided to go in anyways. The staff were super friendly, accommodating and quick at getting me my food. A plus since I was starving.

I got the drunken noodles with chicken, or Pad Kee Mao and it was quite spicy but still flavorful. The portion was  huge, as most thai restaurants here, but I felt the ingredients were really fresh which is great. The chicken was not dry at all and had spices on it too! I was really full and happy after this meal. 

Knowing that this thai place is so close to the area I work I will probably be back again.The interior was really nice, clean and well spaced out. No tables were on top of each other which is nice. I got everything whenever I needed it and never had to ask for anything because the service was so attentive."}
{"text":"Not in the best location or was it the fanciest dine in BUT definitely great food & great service. The curry was my favorite, even added the extra soup to my rice, delicious!! I took it to go & the 3 entrees I ordered were out in no more than 10 minutes. Definitely will be going back for Thai here again soon."}
{"text":"I was on the east side for work and I came across this place. Absolutely amazing. I got their chicken pad thai, my favorite thai cuisine. I'm not on the east side very often, but whenever I am, I will definitely go back. The food was amazing. Service was very fast. Very clean and quiet as well."}
