{"text":"This Top Gun location is brand new,opening up at Warden and Lawerence. This is their 2nd location, the other being the one Downtown. 

To start off, you can tell that they've just opened because of how it looks on the inside. There's a few large folding tables along with the kitchen in the back with a very small door for staff. All orders are done through an iPad (which isn't a bad thing) but you do have to go up and order. 

Service was great, they were extremely busy because of being so new, but the front cashier was very kind and helpful with the menu. 

I ordered The Invader which was 3 beef patties with cheese and onions, in between 2 grilled cheeses, along with their special Top Gun Aioli. Plain and simple, the patties were good but it was just way too much. The few bites that I actually got with the grilled cheese buns were delicious, but most bites were just chomping down straight beef which got fairly unpleasant after a while. I would definitely try a different burger the next time I go. My friends got other burgers on the menu along with a poutine and they all loved it which makes me want to go and try something else. One big bright spot was their special Aioli which was delicious, ask for extra!

3/5 for now but I'll be back and will update :)"}
{"text":"I was looking for a quality burger place for lunch close to work and ended up here. A great flavoured burger, all toppings worked great together. Fresh beef made it unforgetable. The only downside was waiting 25 min the time on my receipt, til the time it arrived at my table.   Place wasnt busy, was only one other table occupied other than mine. 
Not a good idea to visit if on time limits."}
{"text":"**MARKHAM location review 
**Markham location has a special promo going till June 17 -bobcat burger, fries & drink for 9$ (what I got) 
I thoroughly enjoyed my experience - food wise & service wise. I came here on a long weekend & when we walked in the staff was immediately attending to us. My boyfriend bought the star fighter & I bought the bobcat burger. The promo is a great deal considering one burger averages 9$. (They also have off menu halal items) 

Cheaper than burger places downtown so I was happy about that. We did wait longer for our meals, perhaps 15 minutes and the place wasn't busy. So not sure how performance would be on a busy day. However this was made up when we received our food because it was delicious. Both burgers were presented with care & it was clear they took time. The patties were cooked perfectly & were so juicy. The top gun sauce is great & I like how they put ketchup and franks hot sauce on every table so you don't have to go looking around /walk back and forth to refill sauces. The fries were house cut & fresh & you get a great amount of fries (good enough to share). 

Overall a great experience and will be coming back. Despite the longer wait times, I think it's worth it for the price."}
{"text":"I've checked out the Kensington Market location before and I really liked it, so since they opened up a location in Scarborough, I definitely wanted to come by. I was slightly disappointed to be honest. I got the wildcat which wasn't that amazing. It was an average burger, but definitely not anything special, and the buns were cold which immediately threw me off. It's not bad, but it's also not fantastic, so if you're looking for a burger that's gonna blow your mind...this isn't the place sadly."}
{"text":"Had the Iceman steak sandwich.  Was massive and tasted fantastic.  Only drawback would be the price.  Pretty expensive."}
{"text":"I just tried this place and I must say its one of the best burgers I've ever had. Top gun has been on my bookmarks for about a year now - and the long wait is solely due to it being located in Kensington. Luckily, they recently opened a new location in Scarborough. I had their Freedom fighter burger with fries and it was delicious. Overall the food was very fulsome and hearty. Only issue I found with the place was the small space and the difficult to get a seat. Will be going here soon to try other burgers."}
{"text":"Scarborough location review: Went to Top gun seeing all the reviews and the interesting burger ads on Instagram. 
Decor and ambiance: Small restaurant with the inside painted black made it look smaller. Went in on this crazy hot day and we were shocked it was hotter inside than outside. When asked, the a.c. was actually on! And what's with all the pantry outside the kitchen by the door on one side of the restaurant? The paint is also coming off in parts of the wall. We decided to take out instead of dining in. 
Food: Although restaurant was average the burger was amazing! Juicy and flavorful, we got the special $10 \"The Flying Zone\" consisting of a 6oz patty, grilled with swiss cheese, topped with 3 fried chicken strips, grilled onions and grilled jalapenos, lettuce, tomato and chipotle aioli. It's priced generally at $13.99. We had it with the $4.5 home made fries which were good too. Really enjoyed the meal. Highly recommended. 
Overall, don't dine in, take out the burgers. Keep your eyes out for the daily or weekly specials. Worth the value! 
Current promo: The Flying Zone at $10 from Thursday June 28 to Wednesday July 4."}
{"text":"Was looking for a \"burger\" the other night and I ended up here. 

Upon waking in it was pretty busy but later died down as it got closer to closing. Restaurant doesn't have a overhead menu but has print outs available by the cash. It was a little roughed up inside but I came after what seemed to be a dinner rush. tables were not wiped down and there was food and napkins on the floor. 

I ordered the star fighter a drink and a side of onion rings. Didn't wait too long maybe around 10 minutes. Onion rings were pretty standard nothing to write home again, but the burger was pretty decent.. the rosemary aioli sauce was pretty bomb, patty was juicy and the deep fried portobello mushroom wasn't too overly battered. The only complaint I have is ... the burger literally fell apart after 2-3 bites and I had to rest it against the tray to get thru it without eating it piece by piece. A new bun would do their burger wonders. 

I couldn't finish my onion rings because they give a decent amount unlike most places and the burger was a meal on its own.

I do agree with others it is a little on the expensive side especially when they're in a neighbourhood filled with cheap-eats. I did see a lot of people order the steak sandwiches which looked amazing, probably get that next time. 

Do they have kinks to work out but overall I'd come back happily especially to try he steak sandwich. They got a huge following in their Kensington Market location I'm sure they'll present the same quality here eventually."}
{"text":"The chicken itself was nicely grilled, still juicy. The burger buns were cold which kind of took away from the burger. Just another burger nothing too special here."}
{"text":"Its nice to see one of these open up in scarborough. I had been to the one in Kensington before and enjoy it.    My expwerience from both didnt really change on the burger side.  

I went with the Avenger which was pretty much a double bacon cheeseburger, just note the bacon was beef bacon (no pork).  They serve halal meat which isnt really advertised but good for those who want good burger.  

Their Top gun sauce is pretty good, it stands out which what I like for most places to have unique sauce,  that and have filling patties which this place didnt stray from that, two patty which seem to be freshly ground and they werent small by any standard especially with two in burger,

Top Gun is pretty affordable compare to like of Holy Chuck and Burger Presit who have great burger but are a bit costly, All and all, a great addistion to area and a spot I know I will visit again."}
{"text":"We attended the NEW location at Lawrence Avenue East & Warden

Parking: the location is tight on space. However there is Green P parking near by

We got there at 5:30 pm and the place was packed with most doing the Take Out as seating was limited. 

The service left a lot to be desired. With plenty of staff we saw dirty plates left unattended for over 15 mins. It felt like customers were expected to clear their own table before they sat down. Even after getting the meal no one even bothered to ask if we were enjoying our meal. 

Customers are left to getting napkins, cutlery and condiments themselves. But self service was implied."}
{"text":"There were quite a few ads on social media for Top Gun right now, so I decided to go since it was in the heart of Scarborough 

The area for Warden/Lawrence is pretty spacious, but this location and parking lot is tight. The restaurant itself was small, with not many seats (7 tables?) and an awkward layout. I felt like I was in a tiny high school cafeteria.

There's regular burgers and steak burgers. Everything is good, but not huge and a bit overpriced. The aioli sauce is the only thing that makes the burgers stand out. The cheese fries are literally fries with melted cheese, nothing special."}
{"text":"Good, big beefy burgers, and the best part: not too greasy!

Came here for their grand opening. The place is pretty small, got seating for 30 people.

For their grand opening, we were told the wait time was 30 mins for food, but we only had to wait 20 mins really.

Food: Bobcat ($6.50), Bearcat ($11.99), and Fries ($3.79)
The burgers are good! Really beefy, and surprisingly not too greasy! The bun, though, was a bit too big in size compared to the patty. The patty is not dense, really great texture! We didn't taste the toppings too much, as the beef taste is really strong on both burgers.
Fries: just average, they weren't the crunchiest.

Service: As it is only their opening, I expected them to be busy. There were no napkins on each table, and all the forks, knives, napkins are at the table by the door, so we pretty much just helped ourselves to that. The process is you pretty much just place your order at the cashier, pay for your food, and once your food is ready, they bring it to your table.

Price: Prices are similar to Burger Priest, the smallest burger is $6.50. Pretty average for a more non-fastfood burger.

I would come back!"}
{"text":"Soo good. 
You never know when a new burger joint starts up if it is good or not. Seeing how there main location is in the Kensington market area it's got to be at least ok.
It is a little pricey but worth it. I mean wtf is beef bacon? Who cares!!! It is incredible that is all you need to know. The sauce in it is great as well.
Do me a favour? If you are craving a burger, give this place a shot."}
{"text":"???scarborough????????????????downtown????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????side dish?????????????home made?????????????????"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday and I ordered the avenger combo as I saw it was on special 15.50. I clearly showed the cashier the offer and yet she still charged me 25 for the combo. My friend paid for both combos not until after I noticed the bill and the server then pretended not to speak English or offer a refund of the difference. For a place I saw online and have been promoting to my friends I am definitely disappointed at the cashier and service."}
{"text":"Food is great but the service is terrible. 30+ minutes to fry one burger is not acceptable by any standards."}
{"text":"Do not come here. Too many servers walking around with nothing do to while the kitchen is understaffed. Took nearly 40 mins to cook two burgers. Management needs to get their staff organized"}
{"text":"The steak sandwiches are crazy delicious and huge! I loved the sauce and the tender meat. We had the chicken strips too and yum, yum! Delicious fries and milk shakes. Coming back very soon."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE burger joint!! Would give negative stars if I could. You're better off going to McDonalds for a fraction of the time and cost. The restaurant was hardly busy compared to other popular burger places, yet I still had to wait over an hour for my food. They also place your burger in a ridiculous poutine box which makes it difficult to take it out - mine completely fell apart after struggling to pick it up. Not to mention, the egg was extremely undercooked! The entire egg (yolk and whites) were dripping all over the place. I took one bite and threw it out.

This place is overhyped with the amount of paid ads currently circulating. Save your time, money, and chance of getting salmonella and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"waited 30 min for 2 burgers... i do not recommend coming here unless you have time to kill. the chicken burger with guacamole and jalapeño was so dry that i had to throw it out. there was way too many servers and service was terrible."}
{"text":"Food is good, service maybe not so great.

Came here and ordered their TakeYourBreathAway, FlyingZone, and Cheese Fries with beef bacon add-on. I liked how they fried the cheese for TakeYourBreathAway so the whole burger wasn't messy to eat but at the same time very juicy and delicious. I would totally come back for the food.

Service seemed okay at first, typical fast-food dine in type of place. You take the menu to sit down and walk up to the front to order and pay. We ordered a bottle of water along with our food. As we finished paying, we asked if we should grab our own water (they leave it in a fridge beside the cash). The very friendly staff told us they'd deliver it to us along with the meal since we're dining in.However, after we received our food, we asked for the water that we paid for. The second lady impatiently told us something along the lines of \"oh you guys have to go and get it.\"I didn't want to wait too long for my food so I got up and walked to the fridge to grab my own bottled water, while all this time the waitress walked to the same place as me, except she basically refused to give me the water and insisted for me to get up from my own table to get it. Had they have not offered to bring it at first I would have gotten it for myself, or the second staff member could have gotten it for me since she was practically walking WITH me to the fridge. I was not pleased with their service Because there was clearly no communication between staff and inconsistency with what they decide to offer.

Putting the lame service communication aside, the food itself is excellent and I would definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"Had to try this place after seeing one of their burgers on instagram and was lucky enough to see that they opened a new joint in Scarborough (so I don't have to travel to Kensington Market thankfully). Let me just tell you, it was so hard picking just one burger/sandwich because they all just sounded so good. The burgers and sandwiches ranged between $9-$14 (depending on the sandwich) and more $$$ for the 'crazier' ones of course. I picked the \"Flying Zone\" which had a beef patty, 3 fried chicken strips, swiss cheese, grilled onions, jalapeño, chipotle aioli, lettuce and tomato ($12.99). It was SO good (messy but worth it) and how else do you say no to a burger that has chicken AND beef? Their beef patties come from their Kensington location and you can tell/taste the difference from other burger joints because it's that much juicier and real. My boyfriend picked the \"Iceman\" sandwich which had thinly sliced rib eye steak, grilled onions, roasted peppers, topped with mozzarella cheese, roasted garlic rosemary aioli, lettuce and tomato ($12). Again, SO good. The sandwich literally filled up the whole styrofoam container, that's how big it was. I ordered a regular fries and the portion was huge, definitely shareable.    They offer take-out and halal! Will definitely be coming back to try their other sandwiches (all the items on the menu are named after aircrafts).

Downsides? Small parking lot and they don't accept chip-in cards since they use a tablet so cash or tap only."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for the second branch of top gun as we love the one at Kensington market and go often. Everything seemed fine, till we bit into our burgers. The burger buns were not toasted and falling apart in our hands before our first bite! Within the first couple of bites all the bread  and burger had disintegrated and we all ( 4 in our group) had to just eat the patty and the condiments with out any bun. I would've thought it's because they are new and so maybe the bread is stale because there isn't enough traffic yet... but the place was busy! By the time we left there wasn't a table empty. So really they had no excuse to serve stale cold burger buns.. I'm going back to the original top gun at Kensington market, having seriously let down by the new establishment. 
Change the bread and maybe we'll come back. 
On a positive note their milkshakes are very good, same as the downtown branch."}
{"text":"This place makes the best burgers in Scarborough.  It's kinda pricey but it's quality."}
{"text":"A friendly co-worker had told me about this place a week ago, and in a mad rush I decided to go that very weekend.  Since this location had just opened I had anticipated that the wait would be long, and indeed it was... I waited a good 50 minutes for my food once the order was placed.  Despite the crowds the ordering process was well organized and staff were super friendly, given the ratio of resources to customers.

Once I got the food in hand I was pleasantly surprised by how generously sized the beef patty was given the price point!  The burger was moist but had a touch too much salt. The real winner was the addition of the Top Gun aioli, I just wish there had been a little more on the burger.

Given how early I visited this place and how new they are, I'll definitely be going back for round 2.

3/5 stars"}
{"text":"Just recently tried this place out at the new Scarborough location, and I have to say that it was worth the wait! 

I ordered the Invader burger plus fries on the side.  The burger itself was really big and extremely filling as it consists of 3 beef patties (18oz total), lots of cheese, onion, and an aioli sauce.  The buns themselves were grilled cheese sandwiches, so you can imagine a very filling burger that I would say is worth the higher price.  The fries were pretty good also with just the right amount of seasoning.

The only downside to this place is the location size. It's a pretty small place that probably fits 30 or less people, and I would say 30 is pushing it too.  

Overall, it was a great experience for my first time going there. I'd highly recommend this place for any burger fanatic."}
{"text":"I prefer the downtown location. More seating and bigger selection to choose from. I had the Flying Zone, $12.99. It was good but not as good as when I had it at the downtown location."}
