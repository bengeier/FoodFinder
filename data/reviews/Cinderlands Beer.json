{"text":"Cinderlands is a newer brewpub in Lawrenceville with a modern vibe, unique food, and good beer.  If you're looking for somewhere to get a cheap Yuengling and a basket of wings, this may not be your place, but if you are looking to try some interesting food combinations and sample some local beers, this is the place to go.  The menu is a bit limited and pricey, but all of the options appeal to an adventurous eater.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful and made sure our meals were made to order with any specifications that we made.  We did notice a disclaimer on the menu that all fried menu items are fried in peanut oil, so be careful if anyone in your group has a peanut allergy. 

Overall - interesting food and good beer in a clean and cute establishment"}
{"text":"Food was very good, some of the beer was enjoyable.  I've been here several times and it has been a net positive experience each time.  Food has always been a net positive.  The beer has sometimes been great and sometimes middle of the road.  Example- the latest NEIPA has a flavor profile that just did not fit with what you would expect out of a hazy, and not in a positive way (like wet cardboard).  The Mango Berliner was nice though and I hope they have more winners like that.  Still, for how young they are, they are doing great.  When they dial in the beer game a little more, the place will be very busy very often."}
{"text":"The service is super slow here so order a beer the first time your server comes around and enjoy your stay. I was here from out of town and excited to try this newer place. It wasn't overly busy at 5pm on a Saturday night (but it was Derby night and the Penguins were playing). Our server was hard to come by and it took awhile for her to come back and take our food orders. The saving grace was my order of Pierogi's! you get 3 large ones in an order and they are stuffed with potatoes and leeks and served with capers, radishes and mustard. 

Note: they will only split your bill 4 times when you have a bigger party....super weird. Since there were 8 of us, 2 of us each had to be on a check together."}
{"text":"Not only does this brewery have a great location and excellent beer it also has a delicious and creative menu. I was really impressed with both their IPAs and their food. The vegetable side dishes we shared as a group are fantastic and just about enough for a small meal. I also tried the Spent Grain Chicharrones with beer cheese which are my new favorite appetizer. I love that are sustainable and vegan- of course the cheese takes it up a notch so I would recommend enjoying that with it. My dining companions were equally impressed with their food offerings and I'll definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the chicharrones and the Scotch Egg I had here. The chicharrones were just so flavorful and the scotch egg was cooked to perfection. My server was very knowledgeable, and I am not the biggest beer person so I got the rum punch which was very good."}
{"text":"There were 4 of us seated in the upstairs section for a friend's birthday dinner. Our waitress was personable and frank, not awkward at all. I appreciate that in wait staff. 

The food took forever to come out, but our waitress warned us that the kitchen was backed up and she kept checking in to make sure our beers were filled. Speaking of the beers... delicious! I see some folks commenting here that there weren't enough IPAs on the list, and to that I say THANK GOD. Hop heads are ruining the beer scene in the US these days to the point that those are typically ALL you see on draft lists with a Miller Lite and a random stout thrown in.  The beers at Cinderlands were balanced, crisp, bright, and so easy to drink. The Blithering Hayseed was my favorite.

My friends loved the pierogis and I had the brussel sprouts. They were done just right, the marcona almonds (one of my favorite things on the planet) were such a nice touch both with their buttery quality and crunch. 

I'll be back for both the beer and brussels!"}
{"text":"Alright, I went back with my fiance and my father. The food was AWESOME.
My fiance got the octopus, and my dad and I got the burgers. Everything was superb. The fries were seasoned perfectly, the burger meat seasoning was on point. We ordered some beers too and of course we all loved those as well.
The one chef has cooked at a few restaurants I've been to and it's really great to see him making food at this level! Definitely has gotten even better over the years!
If you are looking for a good beer and some pretty stellar upscale bar food... check this place out it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Food is eclectic, which is fine, but I wish for more of a normal menu.  Somewhere I can get some soft pretzels or wings etc. with my beer.  Also, it's pricey.  Atmosphere is odd.  Feels more like a diner or soda fountain bar.  The small 2 person booths are really uncomfortable. Beers were nothing that stands out."}
{"text":"This was our third stop on our rainy day in the Burgh Brewery Tour.  We crossed the bridge from Millvale to seek out this newest brewery.  Crossing the river also meant crossing over to a top notch service experience and higher end d√©cor.  The place is bright and airy even though it's a narrow space.  We garnered a spot at the bar and ordered some beer and food.

I tried the Stellar Peak and my \"better half\" sampled the Kolsch beer.  I loved the IPA and sour fruit play on the Stellar and found it to be super refreshing and drinkable.  The Kolsch was really solid too.  

For food, we ordered the Octopus for $15 that came on a bed of collard greens, navy beans, chimichurri, and pine nuts with a side of hushpuppies.  The dish was sort of lacking in flavor, sad to say, because it looked beautiful.  The octopus was grilled but not seasoned very well and the collard greens were sparse and cut too small to get a nice toothy bite.  The freshly made hushpuppies were sublime and we both thought they should create a dish featuring those with a dipping sauce as they truly could stand on their own.

Our bartender was outstanding!  He was prompt and attentive to us while serving up armloads of beer, crafting cocktails that looked divine, and slinging food orders. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped here since we were checking out some of the breweries in Lawrenceville that we haven't tried, yet. I was glad that we did because this was a really neat little spot!

It's very modern/eclectic inside and I love the the overall aesthetic of the brewery. They have a few chairs for outside seating (although it was way too cold out for that) and a lot of seating inside (tables, booths, and bar seating). 

They do have a food menu, as well. We didn't order anything as we just wanted to try their beers at the time. I had the Blazing Crude which was a coffee based beer and was really yummy. Others ordered the Stack which was also pretty tasty. 

I definitely want to go back and try the food, too. They have Haluski and pierogies on the menu - how Burgh is that? :)"}
{"text":"I was super impressed with this place between the food and drinks. We went for a work happy hour which turned into a 5 hour stay! We ended up trying a lot of their drinks and food, so here's my thoughts...

The menu is small but comprehensive. There's something for everyone - from the classic, juicy burger or melt-in-your-mouth short ribs to the flavorful octopus and hush puppy dish. Then there's the ode to Pittsburgh's ancestral roots with perfectly seared pierogi and a haluski and kielbasa dish. The haluski was amazing and I don't like kielbasa but it was a hit with my friends. It was gorgeous and smelled so good - not something I say about kielbasa often. I do have to say that our table's favorite dish ended up being the chicharones - spent grain fried up and served with cheese. Light and crunchy deliciousness with cheese... Yes please. 

I was so happy that they serve spirits and wine at this brewery since I don't like beer. The rum punch is my new favorite drink in all of Pittsburgh. So dang yummy. They also serve R Winery wines, as well as local whiskey. My husband really liked their double IPA while our friends enjoyed their sour beer. 

Such a great new staple brewery in a great location."}
{"text":"This place never let's me down. Great beer and always fantastic food. The asparagus plate is great. The roasted brussel sprouts are like no other. I have never ordered anything that I was not very happy with. Service is always good, even when it is crazy busy."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere. For my friends who like beer they love the options. The gin mule is delicious. Prices are decent. Multiple vegetarian options for those non meat eaters. The staff is knowledgeable about the food in case you have allergies such as milk or egg or peanut. New menu items do pop up so there's  variety. I was able to alter items based on my allergies, no problem. Love the service, vibe, drinks, food. It's becoming a fast favourite to bring friends and family who visit and basically every weekend I have off. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Beer. Is. So. Good. I loved the farmhouse brew.
Service was excellent. Our waiter was really knowledgeable about the menu. Tried the Brussels sprouts, kielbasa, and soft shell crab. All of it was really good but not enough to give this place five stars.

I will definitely be back. This is a great addition to the hood!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice.  They took a fairly small space and made it feel pretty big.  I like the name and their logo and the color scheme. Also, staff was super friendly...probably one of the nicest waitresses I ever had. 

The food was real good and filling and a good price. We had Brussels sprouts which were amazing and some perogies with parsnips, soured radicchio, and pickled mustard seed...a lot of flavor packed into these homemade dumplings.  I would have like a few more options but I'd rather see a limited menu with amazing food vs a large menu with bad food so all in all, good stuff.

The beer was pretty good.  I'd give the beer a 7.5 out of 10.  They do a decent IPA...their double IPA is delicious but at 9.8%, a little too strong for me for a lunch.  Also have a coffee IPA that was good if your a coffee fan. 

Overall, another great addition to the Burgh's food scene and the beer was a great compliment to the meal so I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped by with my husband on a Saturday for an early lunch. The owner made a point to come over to greet us as we sat at the bar overlooking the food prep area. The drinks were great-I had the daiquiri on the recommendation of our waitress (really good!) and my husband had the Old Man Joe which was one of the best old fashioned cocktails I've ever had. 
The menu was so interesting that we over ordered because we wanted to try so many of the items. I'm not sorry that we did. For the Apps we ordered Marcona Almonds (soft lavender/tarragon flavors with garlic & sea salt), Buffalo Chicken Rillettes (these were amazing served with beer bread & rich blue cheese but the richness was cut with the crunchy, zesty pickled celery)-delicious!! We also shared the Pierogi (the filling was carmelized cipollini onions& Gouda), the Soft Shell Crab sandwich and the Scotch Egg. Everything was seasoned perfectly and almost everything was put together in front of us. The chef spent time talking to us and it was fascinating watching him work. I don't usually drink beer but we were offered a sample and it was really nice-it had a heavy citrus flavor and I wish I could remember the name of that one because I would order it again. 
Don't miss this place-the food, drinks & atmosphere are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Came here on opening night. The place was busy but small. It is very narrow. The atmosphere was nice though and it was set up nicely for the space they have. Didn't like sitting right where they prep the food. Seems like it may cause an issue of contamination if someone sneezes? We didn't eat here. The beers weren't that great, we like ipa beers mostly and there was a very small selection. The said ipa beer really didn't taste or resemble an ipa, even the waitress agreed with us when we mentioned that. Probably won't come back, but cool to check out atleast once!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time here this weekend and my 5th time overall. From the service to the food to the beer, this brewery/restaurant is a great addition to Pittsburgh. The other 30 + breweries in Allegheny County (with the exception of a few) either don't have food or have rotating food trucks. Today my husband and I celebrated Valentine's Day early and went for Sunday brunch. The veggie omelette with rapini and chive/cheddar cheese (honestly don't remember exactly what it was) was flavorful and a generous portion.  The breakfast potatoes popped with spices (not spicey though) and peppers. My only regret is that there wasn't more of them!
My hubby and I are beer geeks and I'm a member of the group Pittsburgh Beer Ladies, but today I opted for the Bloody Mary.....it did not disappoint. Sarah's a great mixologist! Spicy and had pickled vegetables...again I would have eaten a plate of them! It even came with a \"sidecar\" of their Cobra Toes Kolsch. 
Our server Brie described the toaster pastries so well that I couldn't resist them.  Handmade pastry with apple pear jam and foie gras?!?!? Topped with jam made with their Berliner Weisse that appeared as little golden bubbles! The icing also had foie gras and also had toasted fennel seed! Friday night I had the pastrami sandwich with pickled peppers.........total yumminess! My favorite beer tonight was Sand County the Coffee Wit......combining coffee and  a wheat beer is not something I would typically drink but putting the two together was delicious! I also had the Room Tone NE IPA which combined fruity and hoppy and for me that's just the kind of IPA I've been drinking and enjoying lately. The space is warm and inviting. I wouldn't change a thing! Can't wait to see what's next in their beer lineup!"}
{"text":"Cinderlands is a welcomed gem in the Lawerenceville neighborhood. 

They have it all, great craft beer (brewed in-house), delicious food, local PA spirits and televisions! 

Usually around the burgh you have to choose between a place with a tv and mediocre food/beer or a place with good beer/food and no TVs. Not here!

The staff is incredibly friendly and enjoys talking about both the beer and food menus. They must all be very involved in the process because both bartenders I have been served by knew a lot about the beer and food. More than just the normal memorization of the listings. 

Drink must haves: the Coffee flavored IPA, the regular IPA, seasonal cocktail (can't remember the name but it was made with a local rye whiskey and our friend who is not a big drinker loved it so much he ordered another)

Food must haves: Chicken sandwich. The homemade pickles are soooo good! Brisket sandwich was out of this world! 

I will update this post as I try new items but so far I am thoroughly impressed."}
{"text":"Fabulous! We had a large group and went for dinner. Started the evening with appetizers and drinks. The apple shrubs quite delightful. Many had different beers and each one was given a thumbs up. The Brussels sprouts phenomenal. Beer salad had the perfect pairing with roasted hazelnut and goat cheese. Chicharrones crispy and amazing from spent grain from the brewing process. Bone marrow and pickled onions on beer bread nice combination. Beet pierogi yum! Not  too heavy but didn't miss the mark.
The burgers juicy and so much flavor. Will definitely order those again. House made keilbasa was the best we ever had served with ribbon noodle haluski.Bread pudding and house made Pop tarts finished off a memorable feast. Already planning a return trip. Thanks staff for great food and drinks and pleasant service. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Overall disappointing.

The good
-Perogis 
-Brussel Spouts
-The atmosphere

The bad
-The burger
-The chicken sandwich tasted waaayy burnt
-The bill ended up being 65 for two people and we both left disappointed."}
{"text":"Sometimes micro breweries try too hard and make terrible beer in the process, this place is not the case at all! When I first went I was greeted with a beautiful decor and a fun atmosphere. Since they are a newer joint they only had 4 or 5 of their homemade beers on tap. I figured since it was the weekend I was gladly enjoy one of each! Not one of them was bad. Really loved the stout! Now they just aren't a beer joint, the food was awesome! A fancy menu with some interesting things! I tried the burger and LOVED it! The fries were something else too. Highly recommend checking this new place out! Looking forward to trying more of their beer!"}
{"text":"We had the best time here this past Easter.  We decided to take a vacation from the holiday and just do our own thing.  So after church we went to brunch then began to look for a place that was local that had some great beers and was actually open.  A phone call later and we were headed to Cinderlands.

To my surprise they also serve a brunch and it looked pretty good, but we were there for a few libations.  This was our 4th time to this brewery.  On our first visit, which was the day after Christmas, and maybe a month after they opened, we had a fabulous time.  I tried almost all of their drafts that day and seriously loved them all.  Plus we were there in the middle of the week so the place was not busy and we had plenty of room.  On subsequent visits we have run into mass crowds and not such a comfortable atmosphere, but this last visit ranks up there with our first.

There were no seats available at the bar, which is usually our go-to spot, but in the back there were several booths available.  This was nice in a few ways.  One I was never back there before and it is so cutely decorated, and two it was away from the door so we didn't have to deal with the blast of cold air every time someone entered or exited.

Our server was a very nice and attentive young lady who didn't even seem to mind working the holiday.  They had a NE IPA on tap named, Type-Two Fun.  We have been on an NE IPA kick for months now!  Their take on the brew was excellent.  Great full body, golden cloudy color, with gentle bitterness and light tones of orange.  Delicious and growler worthy!  But we didn't have a growler so we settled for a few pints.  

We spent the rest of the afternoon people watching, summer planning, and just kicking it while soaking in this lovely space and tasty drinks.  Thank you for a pleasant Easter afternoon Cinderlands."}
{"text":"Cinderlands is a great add on the lawrenceville! Their in house craft beer are excellent! And the food are on point as well! It is bigger than it looks, they have more seats in the back and a great gathering area upstairs if you are coming here with a big group. They have some board games upstairs if you are into board gams. The stuff are very friendly. I've tried the fried chicken sandwich and it was amazing. I noticed they do change their menu every once a while, i will definitely coming back to try some new items on the menu."}
{"text":"Remarkable food, great service, and quality beer. Cinderlands is packed for a good reason, this is a good place to go for wonderful food and a fun evening.

The booths create a fun personal space. If you want to watch a game you can sit at the bar, but otherwise, the screens are not obtrusive. 

The food is creatively prepared and everything is rather delicious. For example, the apple and smoked goat cheese in the Brussels Sprouts made it a tasty combination. 

Our server knew the menu quite well and was able to make helpful suggestions.  My only criticism is there could be a few more vegetarian entrees.  There are several veggie sides, enough to make a meal, bit nothing much to choose from on the entrees without making substitutioms. 

Cinderlands is a place to keep coming back to."}
{"text":"Important to note: If you come on a Sunday, the menu is breakfast food (mainly) all day long. 

Yes, this is ideal if you're craving a breakfast sandwich at 8:30 pm, however I was a little bummed because I really wanted to try other items on the menu that were not available. However, we did try: 

- Roasted Brussels Sprouts $12
farro / pickled shallots / tarragon / apple / flax seed / smoked goat cheese
*This was really tasty. I ate the entire thing and it didn't fill me up though.. def something to consider along with something else if you're really hungry. The flavors all went so well together: the sweet apple, the smoky and tart goat cheese with the roasted brussels.. really well done.

- Diner Burger $15
Jubilee Hill Farms double patty / bacon / american cheese / mayonnaise / steak sauce / pickles / martin's potato roll
*My partner ordered this. He liked it, however he didn't feel that it was out of this world or stood out compared to other burgers he had. He did enjoy it though and the fries were SUPER flavorful and delicious. Brendan loved the pickles on this and the bun as well. 

- Fried Chicken Sandwich $14
thigh / broccoli cheddar / honey mustard / pickles / martin's potato roll
*This was really tasty. I didn't love that the sandwich was made with the thigh, as dark meat isn't my favorite. However, the chicken was really juicy and crispy and flavorful. I didn't quite understand why there was broccoli on this sandwich, however I appreciate the creativity. The pickles were INSANELY GOOD. It was obvious these are homemade, they tasted so fresh and were perfectly crunchy. The bun was super fresh and super delicious as well. I also loved the fries. Perfectly seasoned and fried to perfection. 

My regret is that I didn't order more beer during my visit. I only tried one, which I really loved, however I should have ordered small pours of multiple beers instead. This is the beer I tried:

- Stray Radiant - Sour Strawberry IPA - 6.8%. The description of the beer was: Huge ripe strawberry, tangerine, and vanilla aroma. Ripe fruit on the palate with moderate acidity and mild cereal grain sweetness. Medium-full body and creamy, supple mouthfeel. Tangy blended breakfast juice finish. Orange-tinted and well-hazed.
*This was really tasty. I enjoyed and savored every little bit of this. 

Overall, we had a really nice dinner here. The ambiance is really comfy. We loved the little booths and how they were raised up a bit. I definitely want to return to try their typical menu instead of the brunch menu and want to try more beers next time!"}
{"text":"Honestly, very impressed witj this brewery.  The spot is amazing. The food was fantastic. Loved all the beers I tried there.  Excited to experience more of their beers in the future."}
{"text":"Cinderlands has great beer and interesting bar food.

We had each of the beers on tap. Our IPA friend liked the IPA and our Ale friend enjoyed the Ale. I'm not quite as picky. Each beer was good. The crowler (mini-growler can) option was nice for taking some to go if you forgot your growler or want a smaller volume to go.

We only had appetizers. The scotch eggs were amazing. It was super crispy and the mustard was fantastic. It was really unexpected to see a soft boiled egg inside but really worked. If your a scotch egg person, you've got to try one.

As a note, we visited once during the Lawrenceville cookie tour. They had fantastic cookies. The cookies are sadly not on the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped last night with my wife and some friends.  The staff was very pleasant and the manager made sure to come over to the table.  The waitress knew the beers and was able to explain it.  They had six beers on tap.  My wife and I decided to just get taster of all six.   The blithering hayseed was light and refreshing and very different.  The RAJ was unique but quite good. The IPAs were on the mark. And so was the stout.  They are very new so they do not fill growlers yet.  But can't wait to bring this beer home."}
{"text":"One of the best breweries in Pittsburgh. In only a short amount of time they have separated themselves from the rest. Really great beer AND really great food. It seems it is usually one or the other but they have managed to do both great!  The service also is amazing from management to the servers. Do yourself a favor and give them a shot."}
{"text":"Went back here yesterday, seated in the back area which is really nice. Beer was fine. Our waitress seemed to have a chip on her shoulder, she was not very friendly. She was very slow too though I guess she had most of the booths in the back. We had the pierogis which were okay and the buffalo chicken rillettes which were not very good. The presentation of the food is great but in the two times I've been there, the food has been pretty average at best. Will definitely be back but food and service could use some work."}
{"text":"Relaxing Environment. Not an extensive beer menu but that is not a bad thing because the focus on perfecting what they have. Will def be back again."}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING as was the beer. I love the decor and the atmosphere of bar. It definitely is a place I will be returning to. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome old building adds to the ambiance of this fun, great brewery. Beer is great and food is fantastic allbeit limiter. Street parking is easy and the feel is eclectic and hip."}
{"text":"Hands down the best beers from a local brewery we have had for a very long time.  Food was great, we will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"OMG! The chicken sandwich. Absolutely delicious and the beer is scrumptious too. This may be my new favorite place! Mmmmm"}
{"text":"I am giving a 3-star because of the beer but the food is over-priced and not exciting at all. Go there for a beer before your dinner!"}
{"text":"Granted, when I went with a friend, it had recently opened. Tried two of the brews/ nothing standout and the food was typical bar fare..nothing that would make me want to return."}
{"text":"Warning: This place doesn't have a full bar. There are beers, naturally, four cocktails, and Arsenal cider (yum!). The menu isn't large, and the options traditional with a twist. Three of us got the pastrami sandwich, but it didn't taste like pastrami - not what we were expecting at all. The fries are delicious, though. There was only one desert option, which was a pop tart with foie gras icing on top. Eew. 

Basically I only liked the cider and fries. I hope the new location (former Spaghetti Warehouse) will have a larger and more traditional menu."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for a bartender to wait on me only to find out they were sold out of the drinks I wanted to order. And for $10 per beer, they should be able to afford some air conditioning. What a shit hole."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Decor is beautiful and they have a loft with a large table where you can play games with your friends. Staff was very nice!!! We only stopped in for drinks after dinner somewhere else. Husband loved the beer! I had a cider that wasn't made in house. People next to us at the bar ordered food and it looked excellent. They commented on how good it was. Menu looked very interesting and I will be back to try it.  I'm super excited to try the brunch because it sounds soooo good! Great addition to Lawrenceville!"}
{"text":"I stopped here earlier today with my wife for lunch.  The previous day I had read an online article that Cinderlands Brewing was opening the next day.  Since the infamous Lawrenceville Cookie Walk was going on I thought it would be a great day to grab lunch with my wife and then do the cookie tour.  We arrived to the restaurant right around 11:30 and were told we were the first sit down customers which was pretty cool.  They proceeded to take us to the back room which is a fairly open space with some cool string lighting.  Beyond that they also had a front room with booths on one side and a bar on the other.  Last but not least it looked like they had some seating upstairs as well. 

As I often do whenever I visit new breweries I decided to order a flight of beer.  They didn't exactly have a flight but instead had 5 oz pours for $2.50 and so I ordered all 5. All of the beers were actually really good with my favorites of the bunch being the passionfruit whipper (it reminded me of Hawaii) and the IPA (bright and hoppy) which should surprise no one who knows me.  Then for our lunch my wife and I started with spent grain chiccarones (vegan except for the beer cheese) and I went with the brisket sandwich for my entree.  Our chiccarones came out first and they were absolutely delicious.  The chiccarones themselves were light and crispy and dipping them into the beer cheese was heaven.  The beer cheese was good enough that I probably would have eaten just about anything in it.  After we had finished with our appetizers the entrees came out.  Both my entree and my wife's looked great and we dug in.  The brisket sandwich was tasty as the exterior bread of the sandwich had a nice crust to it (a baguette) while the inside was meaty and juicy. The brisket was super tender and tasty and I especially enjoyed the red cabbage addition to it.  I only wish that the mustard which I got on the last 1/4 of the sandwich had been more evenly spread.  It came with a side of fries which were also really good and seasoned nicely.  They were super thin (almost shoestring) which allowed them all to be crispy without a single one being overdone.  The only miss on the dish for me was the tallo aioli but that probably goes down to a personal preference instead of it actually being not good. My wife ended up loving her Brassica which had some great Thai flavors to it.

The bottom line for me is I would head back here again in the future.  All of their beers were really good (some of the best that I have had recently) and their food was delicious too!  As far as a grand opening goes it was incredibly successful too as everything ran smoothly and we even had both the chef and owner talk to us before we left."}
{"text":"My husband, seven month old daughter, and two friends met at Cinderlands in March and had a fantastic experience! Though the entrance is small and assuming, the interior is beautifully updated in an industrial aesthetic and twice as large as I had anticipated. I was skeptical about taking my infant, and she was initially the first child in the restaurant. However, (thankfully) she was well behaved, and eventually, one or two other children arrived as well.

The beers were literally made for us! My friend and I love Belgians, and there were two delicious Belgian offerings on the menu that weekend. I also enjoyed trying a rich stout and a crisp pale ale (which I loved, though I normally dislike that style). Everything that we ordered hit the spot!

The food delivered as well. We ordered a number of things including the Marcona Almonds, Pierogies, Scotch Egg, and Brussel Sprouts. The Scotch Egg was definitely the table's favorite dish, and we inhaled the two that we ordered.

I had a fantastic experience at Cinderlands and can't wait to return in the future! Do keep in mind that the menu -- particularly the beers -- change frequently, so have an open mind every time that you come here."}
{"text":"Recently went here with my sister and parents. We ordered the Brussels sprouts, Caesar salad, and a few sandwiches. The Brussel sprouts were really good but the Caesar dressing overwhelmingly tasted of anchovies. Additionally, I got the fried chicken sandwich and it was so over cooked that I stopped eating after the first bite :/ but if it had been cooked properly, I believe I would have enjoyed the flavors.

Unfortunately, our waitress was not the friendliest and spoke fairly condescendingly to us the majority of the time. I almost spoke to the manager to request a new server. (Which says something because I was in the service industry for years).

The food was clearly made of good and local ingredients. Unfortunately, the delivery was missing. But that, on top of the poor service, makes me doubtful that if I'll be returning."}
{"text":"If I were to turn into a vegetable, I know it would be a brussel sprout. I eat them almost daily. For the most part, I've stopped ordering them out because I cook them so often at home. However, Cinderlands...goodness ...they have a sprout dish with goat cheese and marcona almonds and pomegranates and oh my! I am salivating. The most perfect brussel spout dish ever. I'm so sick of seeing balsamic/parmesan/truffle sprouts on every menu. This dish was bright and beautiful and delicous! I also had a pale ale with black tea...bravo. The perfect pairing."}
{"text":"OMG THE FOOD
Haluski and fried chicken 
Sandwich OMG"}
{"text":"Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! We stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a try, and boy were we happy!  Super cute place. They make their own beer. Owner showed us the brewery downstairs. Just go and try you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent beer and service, the head chef joe makes some killer dishes the brassica was very different and really good if you're a vegetarian. the wait staff is extremely friendly Grace was exceptional with the recommendations I'm so glad we came in here!"}
{"text":"Cinderland's is a brand new Brewpub/Brewery that just opened up in Lawrenceville.  My boyfriend and I stumbled upon it during the Lawrenceville cookie tour, and it happened to be their first day open.  The place itself is really cool! They highlighted some of the unique details of the old building they're in and incorporated lots of brick and subway tile, which I loved! The space was huge too, both big parties and small parties alike could easily feel comfortable there.

There were only 5 beers on tap, but they seemed to have a good mix of different styles.  My boyfriend ordered the NE IPA and I ordered the Berlinner Weisse.  The Berlinner Weisse had a tart and fruity taste, so if you're a fan of sour beers then I would definitely recommend it!  I didn't try any of the food, but everything on the menu sounded delicious!  I would love to come back with a group of friends and try more!!!"}
{"text":"Cinderlands gets my vote for best new spot for beer & food in the city.  Quite the adulation I understand, but let me continue.
The staff is warm and welcoming, I've never had bad service in a city that often times allows for aloof and sometimes lazy service.
The beer, I could go on for hours about how good their beer is.  They nail every style I have had and have cashed in on the New England IPA hype with some killer soft juicy IPAs.  Although, my favorites have been their traditional often passed over styles.  Right now as I type I am craving both their Zwickel Lager and their Grisette, what other breweries in the city can you have those styles AND a NEIPA?
Now, and probably most relevant to this space - the food.  Cinderlands again just doesn't disappoint.  They run 2 menus with very little overlap, the first is their dinner menu which doesn't overwhelm is tweaked for the seasons and is on point.  The second is the brunch menu which has been crushed by yours truly.  Bold statement incoming - Their burgers are top 3 if not best in the city.
I could keep going, but go try for yourself - oh quick tip if you don't like beer they mix up some great cocktails using local spirits as well.
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible staff and the most fantastic coffee milk stout!! The food is spectacular and their manager Matt was super welcoming and accommodating on their first week open!! Go check this place out and give them your money!!"}
{"text":"Great beer, food, service, and atmosphere! I stopped in for the first time while visiting from out of town - looking for exactly what this place delivered. Variety of awesome craft beer on tap. It's quality and variety over quantity here, with 6 beers on tap. Very happy they offer varied styles of brew; try the Gose and Saison for sure. Octopus entree was great and the Scotch Egg was killer! I will definitely visit again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We stopped here a few weeks after they opened and came back on a return visit a few weeks later because we liked it so much.  We really like Cinderlands beer.  When we first came here the bartender gave us some samples to introduce us to their type of beer.  I'm not a big Ipa fan but I love their Ipas here and my wife does too.  When I taste their beer it's very good and refreshing.  Beer doesn't always make you feel that way but their beer does.  We tasted a lot of their different beers and we liked most of them.  My wife loves their Ipa called Stack and they just came out with their Littlefoot which I enjoyed on our last visit.  I probably liked the other beers they had on our previous visit but this was still a very good Ipa.  

     On our first visit it wasn't too busy at first but it started to get busy later in the day.  It was the day after Christmas.  On our second visit it was busy because it was a Saturday evening and playoff football was on.  They have a lot of seating in the back but in the very front is the bar.  They have seats along the wall, about a 13 seat bar, and a bar right in front of their open kitchen which is neat. The heat from the kitchen kept us warm on a bitterly cold Pittsburgh Saturday night!

     The workers that we have encountered here all seem pretty nice.  They work good together and it is a good environment.  It has to be because if you sit at the bar there is a lot going on in front of you.  That is probably the only thing that I don't like about Cinderlands if you sit at the bar.  Since the kitchen is open and right next to you there is a lot of movement but it still doesn't take away from their beer and it's still a really good atmosphere.  We watched football on the second night and had a great time.  They have a food menu that I think is a little expensive but it is different.  There are a lot of interesting items on their food menu.   I don't know if we will ever eat here but we will be back for their great beer."}
{"text":"I had a very enjoyable afternoon here with friends. We had beers and snacks and sat upstairs in the loft area and played games. They have a variety of board games and card games and Jenga available up in the loft area. The chicharrones with beer cheese were delicious. My friend got the pierogies and did not care for them. Overall a great spot."}
{"text":"Loved it! Thoroughly enjoyed my beer, Brussels sprouts, pierogies, and pop tart for dessert. It's like upscale comfort food, yum! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I just don't know if any restaurateur is going to make it work here. First, this place was \"Roasted\" and it was in business for about a year or so. The overall seating arrangement is odd. It's like half speakeasy, half dining area.

Service: There is maybe only one other time that I've felt as rushed by a bartender as I did last night. First off, the place wasn't even that busy on a Friday at 8:30. My friend and I ordered a couple of drinks and I got some pierogis. I finished up my plate, got a box, but my friend was still drinking. He brings the checks...we don't put our cards in them. He comes back 5 minutes later and says \"i put these here for you ladies\". Yep, we can see them, thanks! 

Food: the pierogis were good! Very flavorful and with the pickled onions it was a nice touch. Drink: I had a whiskey apple shrub which was very tasty. I also had the passionfruit Weisse and... no ma'am... will not get that again.

Overall, meh. I could take this place or leave it."}
{"text":"Another new spot that's sure to please. No flights yet so we made our own with two ounce pours. The pours are tasty and interesting. Definitely worth trying out. My fave is the coffee milk stout. Interior not too different than when it was Roasted but it feels lighter and more open. Really digging it here. Next time we come will include dinner."}
{"text":"Fairly new but their beer is good and the spent grain chicharrones are fantastic. Menu is the most interesting we've seen at brew pubs in Pittsburgh. Look forward to visiting in the future."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The beer, food and the crew are fantastic! Highly recommend! Grace is the best server I've ever had the pleasure to be served by and Joe is the best chef ever! The Brassica was amazing. I was full 3/4 of the way through the dish but had to finish it because it was so tasty!"}
{"text":"In town for a couple of days and stopped in to check out Cinderlands.  I didn't eat, just sat at the bar...  the beer is amazing, I tried 3 and they are all well executed. They've got a style for pretty much any taste and they do some incredible stuff with single origin coffee, try the stack overflow coffee double IPA if available, it's awesome, never had anything like it!  Guy next to me got a burger that looked legit"}
