{"text":"This was really good sushi!...Coming from Vancouver, we knew the prices were going to be on the high-end, but the quality was top-notch. The server was great, and you can bring your own wine/beer etc. As someone who eats sushi 2x per week in the sushi mecca, I have to recommend this spot.."}
{"text":"I'm glad I stumbled upon this place. Very good sushi, with friendly staff and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The best sushi I have had in Montreal ... The Dan sushi tartare is amazing and it is BYOW .... Highly recommend this place as the service is also really good. I would say to have the best experience ask for suggestions to the staff which are super friendly."}
{"text":"I don't understand the multiple four and five star reviews this place received.

I came here for dinner and the food was terrible.  I've had grocery store sushi that has tasted better.

Very uninspiring.  Even the miso soup was tasteless.   Rice was over cooked, fish didn't taste fresh. 

The wait staff was very nice and helpful though."}
{"text":"This is such a good sushi spot. I was shocked to be honest! Everything was fresh and tasty. The miso soup was a bit bland, but i liked it. The rolls are perfectly made, very reasonably priced, and the fish and veggies are up to par. Not to mention the edible flowers they tend to put on them! Over all the menu is small, service is good, and the green tea is real tea leaves! BYOB! which is rare for Montreal i see...also you can sit outside =)"}
{"text":"Excellents sushis et service impeccable! Les sushis sont servis avec des fleurs décoratives. Toujours satisfait à chaque visite."}
{"text":"Déguster des sushis végés sur une terrasse et apporter notre vin est maintenant possible à Montréal. Les sushis sont très savoureux. Mes amis/es ont tout autant aimer leurs sushis fait de poisson et fruits de mer. Le service est rapide. Ils acceptent les réservations. Il y a une SAQ à 2 coins de rue. Les proprios et serveurs sont adorables. La rue SteCatherine et son plafond de balles roses réservée aux piétons rend l'expérience unique. Un très bon resto abordable sans prétention à revisiter souvent!"}
{"text":"Meh! I know its tough to get fresh sushi this far inland. Menu is kinda funky took me awhile to understand it. They were very busy so service was way off. It didn't help that we were sat at an akward table with tons of server traffic walking by but know one really stopped at our table to make the experience better. Food refelected the service, lackluster no real standouts, bland. Great location! amazing patio. great people watching, love the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food: somewhere between average and great
Price: reasonable 
Service: GREAT! 

Their sushi does not taste amazing, but I wouldn't say it was bad. Unlike the neighborhood, the place itself is very calm and relaxing which I enjoyed the most."}
{"text":"We love this place and usually come mid week when not as busy. Super friendly staff and awesome sushi. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Super bon, juste un peu trop cher, on pourrait avoir du riz en plus.Serveur très sympa !"}
{"text":"What a gem! After doing quite a bit of research in my quest to get some blissfully sublime Sushi in Montreal before my visit, I wasn't very sure what I would come across. And after seeing a sushi chain already (Sushi shop), my hopes started dwindling. And then we bumped into Dann Shushi (no idea about the significance of the extra H). So happy we found it! 

This place was absolutely everything that I was looking in a sushi restaurant in one of my favorite cities in the world. From the moment we sat down to order our dinner, till the time we left filled with some yummy sushi - the 'happily ever after' feeling in my tummy! Since there is absolutely nothing negative to write about this place (YAY!), I shall list down all the good stuff as quickly as I possibly can. Although I can go on and on and on... not like the 'Talking body' song on the radio these days - or maybe like that :o)

Food: We ordered from the specialty rolls' section. The fish combinations in some of the rolls looked very interesting. Every maki roll that we had (6 of them) was perfectly made with the ingredients melting in mouth - sign that the sea foods used were very fresh. The use of rice in the rolls was another testament of the chef's prowess. Every bite hit a perfect note. Not to mention the use of flowers in decorating the plate. The one picture I took was enough to sum up the entire experience. 

Service: The kind lady managing the front of the house was also taking orders and bringing in the food. Pretty much a 1 woman show. She was very nice in explaining the menu options and very courteous throughout. I could see some of the locals were regulars too and she knew them all on a first name basis. Very nice.

Location: Perfect for either indoor or outdoor dining. We sat outside on a not so crazy hot day and thoroughly enjoyed the people watching that rue Saint Catherine can provide. It was a light breeze and the space outside was perfect.

Following are just an FYI. They do not have WiFi. Then again, that's a good thing in my opinion. Why dig your eyes in your phone when you are out having a wonderful meal enjoying your company. But they do have Bring your own Wine policy, Most patrons were coming in with their bottles of wine. What a fun time and such good food. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and it's so fresh!
Totally recommend the Dann Tartare. 
We also ordered Tec, Spicy Salmon with Avacado, Ebi Tempura, Kamikaze, and the Tora Tora Tora - all super yum!

It's a bring your own wine place. Service was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Bel endroit pour manger de bons sushis frais, à moyen coût, en apportant votre vin et en étant assis sur une terrasse sur la Maine. 

Ils ne sortent pas de l'ordinaire, mais le menu est très bien et la qualité est au rendez-vous! 

Je vous le suggère si vous aimez les sushis traditionnels :) !"}
{"text":"L'un des meilleurs sushis où j'ai eu la chance d'être invitée! 
Des horaires flexibles qui permettent d'y manger même tard le soir en fin de semaine (tant qu'il y a du monde c'est ouvert)... 
Un accueil chaleureux et souriant, un service rapide et efficace, la nourriture fabuleuse en particulier les sushis à l'anguille un vrai délice! Et ces magnifiques fleurs comestibles aussi délicates que délectables... 
Le tout pour un prix très raisonnable :)
En couple ou entre amis le restaurant au cur du village où il faut s'arrêter!"}
{"text":"Located in the vibrant heart of The Gay Village, Dann Shushi was an unexpected surprise. I never had a sushi like this before. The menu it's call Discoveries (it's in french, by the way) and the only thing similar to the American style it's that is a roll.

Ingredients and sauces are different. For instance, they don't have soy sauce. The sauce for my roll was white. Good but strangely white. Interesting.

Good perk... you can bring your own bottle of wine.

Service was great for a busy area like this, and the locals make the surroundings super chic and fun... Awww, my gays!!!!!

Did I like it? I loved it."}
{"text":"The Tuna Tartar wasn't very good.  We were in a hurry and told the waiter, or owner and they got us in and our super quick.  Also had a role that I don't remember the name of and it also wasn't that great either.  


Great people watching!"}
{"text":"We chose to eat at Dann Sushi tonight because we saw all the glowing reviews on yelp. We were expecting a somewhat decent experience but were left drunk on cheap wine we had brought because the food was that bad. If it wasn't for the alcohol I brought and the company I was with, the experience would have been awful. 

Our first course was a watery and void of anything good wannabe miso soup. A HUGE bowl of pretty much nothing. Void of any taste. And what comes next ? Chewy, overly deep fried \"tempura\" mixed plate; Consisted of two pieces of sweet potage and three overly battered shrimp. *DO NOT RECOMMEND. 

The main event of the night, the sushi platter, which was the most costly at min. 16$ per roll led us to completely write off the night as a loss. The plate consisted of CHUNKS of sashimi in various forms. 

So... We'll never go back, but at least we had cheap wine to help us through #BYOW"}
