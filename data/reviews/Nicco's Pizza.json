{"text":"The one chick that works there tried to charge me extra $$$ when politely asked for some paper pates and napkins WTF?? most places have these items on counter, for FREE!! Then she got rude and I swear she called me the B word under her breathe as I was walking out door, plus their bathrooms are sooo nasty  never clean check it out , I wouldn't go back they suck, always looking  to see how they can get over on their so called customers wrongo!!"}
{"text":"Great handmade takeout pizza. I picked up a large cheese with some fries and a salad for 20. Definitely not good for eat in, we took ours back to our hotel."}
{"text":"the toppings are top notch.  sauce is perfection.  customer service is to die for... but the dough recipe needs work.

more salt, more yeast and a little more time in the oven."}
{"text":"I drive a semi and when ever I stop here in delighted because I get to order pizza from here. I think I order when ever I'm in the area, provided I don't come in and 11pm and leave before they open."}
{"text":"We order lunch from here every once in a while, which is nice since they deliver--and pretty quickly too!   I got the lunch special steak hoagie and it was a pretty good deal. You get fries and a drink with most of their lunch specials.  The fries were pretty bad, cold and stale, but the hoagie was good!"}
{"text":"We ordered the pizza, wings and pepperoni rolls for delivery. Food was really good. Probably the best pizza in Coraopolis."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery and inexpensive-- the pizza was great and I don't usually like wings but my boyfriend got them and I thought they were good!"}
{"text":"New to the area and was looking for some great pizza.... i found it!! Had a buffalo chicken with bacon and it was delicious! Nice, greasy, perfectly spicy and cheesy! This will be my weekly haunt for great pie!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting - examples of filth include lack of soap in the bathroom (where food service employees work!), dust everywhere, and a layer of build-up under the table when we shifted it a few feet.  Nothing looks like it has been cleaned since the 90's, same goes for the decor.  The pizza was also poor quality, and when I tried to order just a slice, they directed me next door to the convenience store where it is sold by the slice.  It's obvious that the people here put no effort into running their business... when we were there, they were sitting in the back waiting around when they could have been taking steps to clean and do something about their filthy establishment."}
{"text":"When I first moved here, It was the end of December, I had the flu and bronchitis, and working, plus trying to get an apartment set up in the midst of it all.  Needless to say, I did take advantage of delivery the first couple of weeks here.  Nicco's, by far, is my favorite place to order out from.
Granted, I don't order delivery that often now, but when I'm in the mood for Italian and want to hunker down at home to a good movie, Nicco's is the place I call.  There wings, pizza, and subs are great!
My son came down to visit, and his last night here, we ordered Nicco's, he fell in love with it."}
{"text":"Great pizza friendly service, nice addition to the area."}
{"text":"We love niccos! We use to go to Pizza Hut all the time because we tried so many pizza places and they were terrible, then we found niccos! Great meat lovers and cheese bread is amazing! My kids will not eat any other pizza now:) the owner was so nice and talked to my little ones and made them feel special:)  keep up the great work down there!"}
{"text":"We've tried about every Italian establishment in the Coraopolis/Moon area and Nicco's has the best of every category. The pizza, hoagies, salads, and pasta dishes are excellent. We usually have it delivered and it's always fast, fresh, and hot. If you haven't tried them yet, see what you've been missing!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight, first time. I ordered the gyro platter with onion rings. Quoted delivery time was 30 minutes. 21 minutes later my doorbell rang. The food was hot, fresh and delicious. The onion rings absolutely rocked. The breeding was a little sweet and was the perfect counterpoint to the onion. The gyro had good veggies and sauce. The pita was good."}
{"text":"First time ordering here. Couldn't be more pleased. Ordered an XL pizza for delivery, given an estimate of 30-35 minutes. Pizza actually arrived in 25 minutes! Delivery guy was cordial, pizza was absolutely delicious. Very satisfied."}
{"text":"Niccos always has great deals in the Penny Saver. I almost always order the large pizza with 4 toppings for 14 bucks. Huge and lots of cheese, toppings. They have yet to disappoint..."}
