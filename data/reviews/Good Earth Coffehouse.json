{"text":"Ridiculous ! $4.75 for a slice of skinny carrot cake .. So the whole carrot loaf will probably cause $47.00 ...is this made out of gold?? Please tell me"}
{"text":"Coffee shop in the new hospital at the south entrance.  Modern decor.  Bright windows.  Airy.  Mellow music.  Latte was good.  Panini sandwiches tasty and mini muffins and scones good.  Mini muffins ha seeds and grains so high fiber and filling.  You can get your scone heated.  Not too expensive.  Good place to hang out.  Has couches too!"}

{"text":"Prices are outrageous!  Bring food and water if you are going to spend any tI'm waiting at this hospital ( you will need all your cash for parking!)"}
