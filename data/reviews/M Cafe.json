{"text":"Great spot for brunch ( large portions and fresh dishes) quaint spot and nicely decorated along with friendly staff.  Was here several times over the holiday season and even tried the macarons which were perfect ( unlike some places where they were hard or stale). Fave macaron flavour was the apple cinnamon, highly recommend for brunch or even just coffee and dessert in the evenings.  Atmosphere is very romantic"}
{"text":"Easy-going cafés are hard to come by in the areas between Bishop and Peel, and I once thought M was different. Unfortunately in the past few months something has changed, and not for the better. M café now feels like a cheap, bad diner without the food and prices to match. The same salad I had last time was now drenched in oil. When the servers weren't clinking down cutlery or leaning over us mid-bite to pour us water, they were loudly chattering being the counter. Was this a one time thing? I don't know. I'll do my best to avoid this place in all its synthesized-music-medley glory, unless I'm picking up a box of macaroons to go."}
{"text":"We had lunch last week during F1 festivities. We order salmon (best crispy skin and flavour), pesto chicken pasta, French toast, eggs benedict. Everything was excellent. A bit pricier than a standard café, but we would go again.   Bathroom was a bit dirty though, with a toilet brush just hanging on the wall."}
{"text":"Great place - from the excellent food to the service, M Cafe was just fantastic.    Had planned to try a few different places for brunch, but our group kept coming back to M Cafe for the omelets, croissants (can't miss - hazelnut & chocolate), macaroons (about 6-8 flavors, chocolate, vanilla and sea salt caramel were just delicious).  The macadamia flavored coffee was both different and soooo good, and the Caprese panino was a favorite among our group!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"A trendy spot (and aims to be).  Atmosphere: The M-Cafe is located on the corner of Maisonneuve and Rue de La Montagne, this area of Montreal has fast become the local of upwardly mobile locals as well as very well to do foreigners.  As such, the M-Cafe was recently (circa 2008/2009) revamped to appeal as a more refined cafe.  Cosy and well furnished,  M-Cafe is a good place to spend brunch or a quite afternoon / early evening, before a crowd starts to form around mid to late evening (6-8pm).  Outside seating is available in the summer time - but being located on a motor-vehicle busy corner of Maisonneuve makes the experience a little less then ideal.  Not always a bad option - but beware of traffic.   Service:  For a place that aspires to the professional and sophisticated crowed, the service has to live up to.  My overall experience (over several visits) has not been positive, as I found the staff lacking in attentiveness (incorrect orders) to being slightly indifferent and bordering on rude.  At other times, I found the service simply ok.  Food:  Nothing distinguishing here.  The main culinary attraction at M-Cafe is there relatively plentiful breakfast / brunch menu.  Many selections of eggs, omelettes, pancakes / crepes, and Benedict's are on offer and this selection is complimented with offers of side orders, and salads.  The dinner section of the menu is a little litter with classics such as steak and pasta dishes offered.  M-Cafe also has a nice selection of sandwiches on offer for a mid-day snack.  For the price though, none of the times on hand scream value.  Lastly, and perhaps the ultimate reason to visit the M-Cafe is their deserts.  From Macrons to crepes, and selection of cakes - these are what makes spending some time at the M-Cafe worth wile.  Overpriced, but trying to live up to the price tag ~ worth a visit."}
{"text":"|After being discouraged from going to Eggspectations due to the long line-up, I looked across the street and found this cute little cafe that boasted macarons, soups, sandwiches and breakfast.  I was not disappointed!  This is a great spot for any hot chocolate lover. I ordered the \"chocoscotch\" which is a hot chocolate with butterscotch and roasted hazelnut syrup.  Simply delicious!  My partner, on the other hand, decided to go with the more mellow, less sweet hot chocolate with macadamia and hazelnut syrup.  Equally delicious.    In terms of brunch food, we both ordered meals that we were yet unable to find in the city, and both were very tasty.  I ordered the M Benedictine, which is a plate of eggs benedict with baby spinach, hollandaise sauce, and tasty tomato sauce.   The tomato sauce was such a great addition that I ate my side potatoes with the sauce instead of ketchup.  My partner ordered the Western Omlette, which he said was one of the best omlettes he's had in a while.  It had strips of zuccini and peppers and did not fail to impress.  In conclusion, I'd definitely go back, if only for the hot chocolate.  Due to low line-ups for breakfast, this is an obvious (and I'd argue better and more sophisticated) breakfast joint than the usual."}
{"text":"Have come here for brunch and dinner. The dinner didn't stand out for me (basic sandwich that was tasty but nothing exceptional). However, the breakfast was delicious (especially the macaroons and cafe au lait ordered to finish off). Will be going back for the macaroons (but most likely not for dinner)."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and waiter was extremely rude. While I was ordering he just walked away. It was a hot day and he never offered us water and didn't even  come over to take a drink order. When we paid our bills he was hovering over us demanding a certain amount of money for a tip. He stood there and waited until we paid him. My friend was counting out money and he just reached into her pile of change and took money out for his tip! The food was good but the rude service made sure I will never go back here."}
{"text":"Excelente. Muy buena comida y atención personalizada. Comida muy fresca y bien elaborada. Felicidades"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great restaurant. It's actually not just a bakery, it's a restaurant, too. - The menu has tons of options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I really wanted to try the breakfast items, but because I ended up going in the afternoon, I had lunch instead. The servers were great, all very friendly and efficient. My food came pretty past, which was another plus, but it also wasn't busy at the hour I came. I order grilled chicken with steamed veggies and fries, and oh my goodness that was the best-tasting grilled chicken I've had in ages. The drinks are somewhat expensive, so I wouldn't get anything unless I'm really thirsty.  If I ever come back to downtown Montreal again, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always, always, ALWAYS ordered their salmon. It comes with baked/grilled vegetables, rice, and a side salad. That salmon is really good! I'm the pickiest when it comes to seafood, especially salmon! I grew up eating salmon on a regular basis. Now I don't know if my expectations have just lowered since I moved away from the ocean but damnnn that's a good salmon."}
{"text":"Most likely one of my favourite brunch / late night restaurants... I come here very often , and I wouldn't judge this restaurant based on review from years ago. As a matter of fact, the service has always been excellent and if there is any problems, I'm sure the management can accommodate any of one's needs.  As for the food, I've never really disappointed. I'm a huge brunch freaks along with my girlfriend in which everything we have taken so far has been tasty and done correctly. Presentation is always on point. Maybe one or two cons for brunch at M cafe is the potatoes are not always on too , but you can ask for their crazy fries instead :) . their Benedict eggs is also a downsize it's not the best in town , but you can expect a decent taste -- the eggs will be done perfectly.   Now the dinners , these are epics ;) LARGE PORTIONS / great desserts and wine selections ? Who would say no to that ? And this is not all, because they serve until around 1 am!! I love their burgers and their chicken plate , portions are large and will fill your tummy up. Following your meal , you can opt for their desserts which range from macaroons to cheesecakes , I highly recommend the raspberry cheesecakes if you share some love for sweets.  Overall, come to m cafe regardless if it's for a brunch , meal or coffee because this place rocks the world.  Note that in summer it can get pretty hectic and busy , especially if you wanna get a drink outside on their \"terasse\"."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch on a long weekend trip to Montreal.  The food was pretty good,--I had a tuna salad sandwich, and my wife had a smoked turkey baguette.    On the other hand, the service was rather slow, and the price (about $30 for the two of us, with just the sandwiches and one Coke Diete) seemed pretty steep, especially compared to some of the other deals that we got in Montreal (better food, lower price at both Buvette Chez Simone and le Cartet).    It was a perfectly fine lunch spot, but not worth making a trip for, and nowhere near the best available that we experienced in our short time in the city."}
{"text":"Great place, reasonable prices, great food. I especially love the grilled chicken breast. It's always cooked perfectly (charred but juicy), I always substitute the french fries for extra vegies and take a greek salad to start. Can't be beat! My fish eating friends also love the calamari and the salmon."}
{"text":"Belle terrasse a l'extérieur dans un beau coin, a l'angle de Maisonneuve et de la Montagne.   Nous voulions un petit café en fin d'après-midi, ainsi qu'une petite collation. Nous sommes donc allés a l'intérieur du M café, ou on nous a gentiment demandé d'aller dehors et de nous assoir si nous voulions commander a manger. Nous avons opté pour 2 macarons et un espresso. Le café était bon, mais pas excellent. Les macarons étaient délicieux. J'avais pris mangue poivrée ( très goûteux et spécial ) et mon copain noisette. Il a aimé, mais sans plus. Pour le prix, c'était ok."}
{"text":"Horrible and waste of time and money.  We ordered breakfast and 10 minutes later the coffee arrived.  When the breakfast arrived in a further 15 minutes my plate was dropped on the table, throwing half the dry unseasoned potatoes on the table.   The eggs were overcooked and unseasoned, the one slice of toast (everywhere I've ever been serves two slices...) was unbuttered and on the side the butter served was hard, cold, and unusable, the beans were congealed, and the fruit sad and boring.  My friends meal was worse.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I wanted to try fairmont bagels and I luckily got to do that at M Cafe. I had a sweet tooth and ended up with a lot of dessert. The macarons are made by someone from Paris! The blueberry topping on the cheesecake was delicious! I'd recommend that one but the other two were good as well :)"}
{"text":"We only bought dessert to go, so that is all I can comment upon.  On our way to dinner at another establishment we saw the dessert case from the window and made a note to stop by if we still felt like something sweet after dinner.  Of course the kid wanted dessert, so we stopped. The desserts looked interesting and tasty and we we chose the Wild Raspberry & Chocolate Cheesecake and a (I am not complete sure of the name) Cafe a Lait flavored cake (genoise layers with coffee flavored cream and the like).  They were both complete disappointments. The cheesecake especially tasted like it had been in the refrigerator case for weeks.  While ordering, I got a good look at the case and am pretty sure these are brought in, possible from one of the big restaurant suppliers.  I assure you, they are nothing special so do not waste the time nor calories. Just not worth it."}
{"text":"Always go there for desserts and coffee. Everything is soooo good and just beautiful, like the Caramel Apple Crumble & Espresso Allongé I had this afternoon.  Always worth it! Staff also super nice everytime!"}
{"text":"An OK place to get a quick snack, it wasn't too expensive like other places. It's at a good corner for business, close to the hotel we stayed. The food came out from the far side of the place, I think it's somehow linked with a bar or restaurant next/above it and may be sharing the same kitchen. I guess someone out there will confirm that for me. Worth going to when in a rush to go somewhere and you need a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of M Cafe. I come here for any occasion - breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, or drinks... you name it, I'm down. The servers are friendly and the menu has a lot to offer.   First and foremost, they have a delicious selection of sandwiches, salads, and daily soups. I recommend \"La Bergere\" for some goat cheese, dried fruit and pecans over a light green salad or \"Le Medi-Medi\" for a perfectly grilled salmon filet that melts in your mouth over a fennel salad. Also, I love their chicken wrap, it's really good and they pack it well, so you really feel like you're eating a chicken wrap, and not a wrap with chicken! If you ever get a chance to try their roasted red pepper soup or their carrot soup, you will not be disappointed!   For the cherry on top... They bake some fantastic cakes and sell the most teasing, mouth-watering macarons that come from La Maison du Macaron! Seriously, sometimes I just come here for red wine and macarons. It doesn't get any better than that! My favourite macs include Pistachio, Blueberry, Caramel & Sea Salt, Chocolate & Walnut.  My only complaint is that their breakfast is decent, sometimes it seems a little dry and their potatoes aren't the best... I've had better.  Also, their servers can be slow at times and forgetful. Everything else that I've mentioned keeps me coming back for more though!"}
{"text":"See my check in for this place. Good place nearby everything down town. Seem family run. Service for pride."}
{"text":"A cute cafe with indoor and outdoor seating.  Good coffee and macarons!  They also serve salad, sandwiches and other light bites during the day.    It was the Canadian Grand Prix and French music festival weekend, and a few protesters marching around followed by almost equal number of policemen, amidst all the actions and commotions we walked by this place hoping to get a table and expecting slow and sloppy services, surprisingly, got a table after a short wait and both of the servers who helped us were attentive and efficient.    Macaron shells are crunchy and airy, we tasted a few flavours -- salted caramel, mojito, orange chocolate, apple cinnamon, hazelnut -- the filling is a little on the sweet side but there is plenty of flavour to shine through so they didn't taste empty-sugary.    This is a great place to stop by for coffee, desserts, and a light meal and relax if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The only negative dining experience I had in Montreal. The lady behind the counter was super friendly but our server was disinterested and defensive. The food, which was already made (just pasteries, cake) took 30 minutes, and we wound up being late for our flight. No, we probably shouldn't have gone here right before our flight, but who would have thought it would take so long to bring me a piece of cake I literally pointed at?  More over, when we politely asked to have it to go because of the flight, she was really rude.  Oh, and they also have frappe's on the menu but not available for order...what's that about. She just said they didn't have a blender. I guess that may be, but then why have them on the menu? Or perhaps she just didn't want to make them? The world may never know..."}
{"text":"I was in a hurry and the place seemed nice enough. The service was good. I ordered the pancakes and fruits, which is exactly what I received. 3 smallish pancakes and some small bits of watermelon and cantaloup. The plate was quite dull, I would have expected more for the price. My SO had the bénédictines, again nothing impressing. I had better at breakfast joint all around the city.   First and last time."}
{"text":"What I had: La Tomatta  Summary: Food-excellent Service-good Ambience and decor-good  Went there for breakfast. Were seated right away. The waiter was polite and helpful. We ordered our food it came out rather quickly and was delicious. Their house potatoes were flavorful and done perfectly. The servers were very helpful and polite. My only complaint with them was that they seemed to be arguing about tips and that threw me off a little, I was in a bad mood so that could be it too. Overall for sure will go back."}
{"text":"Went there for the desserts, didn't eat a full meal. I had the macarons, chocolate lava, and the carrot and caramel cheesecake.  They offer a dozen kinds of macaron flavors, and they have some original ones such as tiramisu and rose. The rose one stood out the most, it tasted just as it smells. The chocolate lava was disappointing, the waiter heated the chocolate lava for us but the inside was not gooey and liquid enough. Usually the  gooey chocolate in the center is supposed to flow out, but it was not liquid enough... The cheese cake was also disappointing. The cheesecake was pretty much 80% carrot cake and 20% cheesecake, and the cheesecake part was too soft (I usually like it when the texture is dense).  Probably will come back to buy macarons since it is located close to downtown, which is convenient for me, but won't be back for anything else."}
{"text":"I came here for the macarons. I ordered a coffee and 4 macarons. I wasn't impressed with them at all. They were just dry and brittle like they've been there for a few days. I can't review the rest of the menu for the restaurant as I didn't have a meal there. the music from the place up stairs can be heard from where I was sitting. I might go again to eat a meal but i will never order macarons there again."}
{"text":"I asked a local where to hit up brunch in this hood and he directed me here. A little French bistro with a great menu filled with salads, sandwiches, egg and crepe options, this little place was packed on a Monday afternoon.  I went with the sandwich and soup combo for $12. The chicken club and a cup of creamy tomato (though as the waiter mentioned, the soup was not too creamy, just a hint). The sandwich was large with delicious crunchy bread and what tasted to be a homemade garlic aioli. I loved it. The chicken was sliced thinly so you could actually get your mouth around the sammy (we are clearly not in Jersey anymore). The soup was perfect with chunks of vegetables; I couldn't have asked for a better lunch. It was large but not too big where I felt like death after.   Service was amicable if not a wee but unprofessional, food was more than agreeable. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the neighborhood and need a nice little lunch spot."}
{"text":"The perfect place to stop for a meal in between shopping, exploring and partying.  This may not be the most exciting or culinarily adventurous place in Montreal, but it's not supposed to be. This is an excellent place to stop in for soup, a sandwich, french fries, coffee or dessert.   Much more relaxing than fast food and the service is very friendly. In the grand tradition of European-style cafes, the service is not hurried, but that's the whole point."}
{"text":"I thought about giving this place a second chance so I went for the second time, the desserts are okay, its not the best I had but the macarons are good.   Now my biggest disappointment is their drinks, they have around 4-5 flavoured coffees/cappuccino/latte whatever it is...DO NOT ORDER ANY KIND OF DRINKS IT IS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!! Its cold and tastes super sweet like half the cup is made out of syrup!!  When we finished the guy asked us if it was all good, we said the latte wasn't good, and he said \"yeah I know Im sorry the machine is not working well...\" WTH and then he tells this other guy, don't take latte orders! LIKE SERIOUSLY? Why did u let us order this if the \"machine\" was wrong?? On top of that, he made us pay 5$ even thought the \"machine\" was defective and he knew it was tasteless!!"}
{"text":"This café restaurant is the place to hangout to eat and have delicious desert. Very friendly atmosphere and staff. I just like this place inside out"}
{"text":"While Crescent area can be cringe-worthy, I had a lovely mello time here indoors with the graceful and charming Rawan K, and then outdoors wondering about the women of Wanda's (strip club upstairs) with a brat pack of hawt Yelpers on the sidewalk tables. The macarons were light and lovely (especially the chocolate and coffee ones, yum) and they did in fact pair well with wine and whiskey.  The sandwich I ordered was just okay, and when it was taken away to be doggy-bagged up it never returned. Also: slow jazz. You always lose one star for slow jazz. That's the rule. ;)"}
{"text":"Apparently, M is for \"Meh...\". The service and the quality is mediocre at best. You're going to wait.  Two tables that came in after us wer served before us and simply ordered sandwiches that were pre made.  I ordered a cheese plate  and it consisted of cold Brie, yellow American cheese and some other cheese, I think Edam for $16 I would have expected better. There are much better places on the street for the same price so feel free to walk past this one."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a little bite in the middle of my day yesterday . . . and returned again today, even though it was out of my way. Pan au chocolat was fresh, lightly sweet, flaky and delicious: a perfect compliment to my double espresso. Nice atmosphere, good people watching, friendly staff. Loved it. I ordered at the counter and staff member brought it to my table. Kinda wishing I had tried one of their many, many macaroons . . ."}
{"text":"This place is okay. I've been a few times. They make decent sandwiches and salads. I've been for a late lunch/glass of wine many times. It's nothing special, but given the area it is one of the more reasonably priced places for a relaxed clean lunch downtown. But that said it's still a little pricey."}
{"text":"M Café was a huge hazard to my college studying. Between two libraries, I would run along de Maisonneuve and in the corner of my eye, I'd always catch a spark of color, a layer of cream. One day I looked at the display, and it was all over. Now, all of my trips on Maisonneuve have to include a turn in front of that display, full of layer cakes, big eigth-layered cakes. Mmmm. I waxed lyrical about it so much that my parents were curious to try it and we went for an actual dinner. They have a regular selection of food, but they do try to keep it original. I was very curious about their salads, so I ordered \"la rosace\". My mom had the veal and my father treated himself to a generous helping of pasta. My salad arrived, and surprise! Their salads are bit IKEA, in that the ingredients are not mixed together, but lined one next to another. Meh. Separately, the ingredients are fine, but...it's not a salad! The meat and pasta were great and well seasoned, so nothing to report on that front. But now comes the part everyone's looking forward to: DESSERT! That they have, plenty of! And now I finally got to approach the huge cakes face to face.. Except maybe one or two offerings, all the cakes are cheesecakes, but really fancy cheesecakes: creme brulée, lime, lemon, caramel what have you..  Each is delicious. Try them all. right now.  Or, if that's just too much in a sitting, they have plenty of macarons from Point G. They are a bit on the expensive side tough, around 1,50$ per piece, but delicious. I recommend orange-chocolate, passion fruit, and strawberry rhubarb. Not so delicious is the waitress behind the macarons. Don't get me wrong she's lovely to look at, but I remember her quitting serving a gentleman in front of me the moment her friend walked in the terasse.  Come on now, I'm spending a fortune in flavoured egg whites over here!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this jewel when my sister and i went for lunch down the street. Decided to go in after we spotted the beautiful cake and macaron display through the window. The cakes and macarons are made inhouse by 8 amazing bakers. Apparently each day they sell thousands of dollars worth of macarons!!!! This location is central downtown. They serve fresh inhouse croissants and bagels with salmon etc. The service is excellent. The entertaining staff is a bonus!!"}
{"text":"If I could give NO stars for this place, I would. WORST service I have ever experienced! There was a sign posted for an oyster special, which we told the server we wanted- he didn't bring us a menu, just oysters. They weren't that great, service took forever, and then the guy brought a bill for triple what we were expecting. We asked him about it and he unapologetically told us that we were too late for the posted special. I don't mind paying for fancy food, but 6 dollars for an oyster that's not even good is a bit ridiculous. There were other diners who seemed to be having trouble with their food, drinks, and service, and the managers sounded very defensive. This is definitely not some place I would ever be tricked into going again and I hope my review helps some of you to steer clear, keep walking, and enjoy a dinner with fair prices and you'd get better service at a fast food chain!"}
{"text":"M cafe was a welcome stop after climbing the mountain, clean and with a diverse menu, but the service was poor, Only two servers who also had to bus tables. We had to ask for refills on the water while the servers were chatting away with each other. My dinner of salmon was delicious but beware of the sandwiches. They are pre made and had obviously been waiting all day for a taker and served on a plate looking very sad and lonely, quite disappointing in relation to the excellent presentation of the special."}
{"text":"C'est grâce à Rawan que j'ai finalement mis les pieds au M Café et j'ai été contente d'en faire la découverte. C'est un joli café, un peu plus chic que la norme. C'est l'endroit parfait pour une rencontre de travail un peu plus sérieuse, un rendez-vous amoureux, ou pour le dessert après un bon souper. C'est petit et fait sur le long, donc c'est meilleur pour les couples et groupes de 3 à 4 personnes. Les serveurs sont gentils, mais ils avaient l'air un peu mélangé. Ça pris pas mal plus de temps que la normale pour nous emmener simplement une bouteille de vin, puis il a fallu dire à plusieurs reprise à qui les bouteilles devaient être servies. Si vous y allez que pour une chose, ne passez pas à côté des macarons. Ils sont sucrés, délicieux, savoureux, et originaux (banane et chocolat - je n'ai jamais vu ça ailleurs!)"}
{"text":"Greetings fellow yelpers! If you happen to find yourself strolling in Montreal, QC and get a little chilly, stop in at M Cafe and get a hot beverage and some macaroons!   Now...don't think American macaroons...dense, sweet, coconut delights that they are...think MACAROONS...colorful, light, sweet, melt in your mouth confections! I got a box of 12 of these delightful things...think cross between a cookie, meringue and top notch dessert rolled into one delectable bite sized treat. I tasted the hazelnut, caramel, mango, strawberry, blueberry and coffee, but there were countless others such as chocolate cranberry, pistachio, chocolate, lime, chocolate orange, as well as some others that I can't recall.   They are a little on the pricey side ($22 Canadian dollars per dozen), but well worth it for a birthday, party, or just to treat yourself. These were too great of a find to not share, and I'm surprised that I was the first to tell you about them, but hopefully you'll head out there to try them!!!   Enjoy =)"}
{"text":"Un café informel mais chic où on peut faire une petite pause en solo ou accompagné dans le coin. Service attentioné."}
{"text":"Tried it the first time looking for a quick lunch after class! There were no prices so I ordered a chicken sandwich with Brie with a bottle of water. The sandwich was average and the overall price was 18$ which is a little excessive and overrated for a simple sandwich and a water. Can find better!"}
