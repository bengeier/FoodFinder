{"text":"It used to be that there were no Mexican places in Pittsburgh besides vera cruz in oakland and mad mex. Madonnas was closed already. Suddenly there were many Mexican joints all around the burgh. El burro has actual Mexican cooks and is run by a San Diego beach boy ,Mexican food enthusiast. I love El burro. Everything i have ever eaten from here is great. Its a great place to take a vegan or vegetarian on a computer dating meet up destination. Also its really close to downtown and they deliver on fridays and saturdays.  El burro is tight. El burro is a hip place. The food is killer . Viva El Burro"}
{"text":"Eating these right now and compelled to write a review now... Love this place! Always keeps me coming back for more. EASILY THE BEST TACOS IN THE 'BURGH!!! My go to tacos- carne asada, and chorizo with pineapple habanero salsa!! So good.. Guac and chips awesome too! If you haven't tried them, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Having come from California, the Mexican food is lacking in Pittsburgh. And my husband and I have tried a LOT of places since we moved here. We made the trip after having read the reviews, and this place is awesome! The food is as close to what we would get in California. Wonderful flavors and spices. And no white queso! Still have no idea where that came from. Never saw it in Cali or Mexico."}
{"text":"Prices have increased at this location to cover the higher costs of operating their second location in the east end. Online menu was not updated to reflect this. Decent food but for the price they now charge, there are better options."}
{"text":"A OK!  tasty, flavorful carne asada burrito.  wall shelf dining only with no table service.   small, clean restaurant with dia de los muertos motif.  You may hear the cooks debating in the back in Spanish but that is all part of the laid back ambiance.  $24 for dinner for 2: but no chips, no salsa, no guac dip.  I'd give 4 stars but my steak was gristley."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Chips and salsa were very greasy.  I feel like it was generic but overpriced and the service was pretty miserable despite leaving a nice tip for take out.  Better off at el campasino or any other Mexican restaraunt.  Pass."}
{"text":"These are some of the more generous and best-made of the new crop of \"authentic\" tacos in town, and certainly the freshest. Considering how much is \"from scratch,\" they're also pretty fast (5-10 minutes). Salsas are particularly good, too.   If you like the sort of taco you'd get in the southwest or in mexico--I'm pretty sure you will like these.  If you're expecting tacos to be dirt cheap, pre-made, and have a pile of random shredded extras on them, you may be happier at the taco bell a mile or so away. (Or get a burrito. It's 6 hours since I ate one, and I'm still comfortably full.)  I'm told some of the veg options are also pretty good (though others are a bit bland until you dose them generously with the excellent salsa). Did I mention the salsa? (And real guac.)"}
{"text":"Their carne asada burrito is the best burrito I've ever had. I can't recommend this place highly enough. I will be back."}
{"text":"I get the beef burrito and it has been consistently good. It's on the small, relative to say, chipotle, and much better. They're grilled to give a nice crunch. The chips and salsa are tasty and homemade. Overall, the price is a bit high but the food is good."}
{"text":"As a first time customer i asked the clerk about the menu. I was the only client and the clerk was extremely short. The burrito was bland at best and a basic side such as lettuce and tomato was extra expense.  I do not recommend el burro, you might as well go to taco bell...its cheaper"}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood so we thought we gave it a try. Got the Chorizo Burrito with guacamole.  Other than the rice being a bit crunchy. We liked it. I'm not a burrito fan anyway. Next time I'll try the tacos or quesadilla. Burrito was the right size. Didn't come away feeling stuffed. Just full. It's a neighborhood take out place. There's about ten stools and counter space to eat in. We'll definitely return."}
{"text":"I was so excited for a new restaurant in Regent Square but unfortunately I was very disappointed in my 2 visits to El Burro.  The chips are awful, they are served in a plastic bag with a dressing cup of salsa, and they are too greasy so consume without risk of nausea.  Unfortunately the entrees were average at best.  The best item I tried was the plain cheese quesadilla I ordered for a child.    Please El Burro, I want to see you succeed in Regent Square, take a few steps to improve your dishes and definitely change your chips.  Consider table service, real plates and silverware, quality chips, and improved entrees.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I'd just moved from California and was missing quality Mexican food. My burrito was awesome. Really glad we stopped in. Homemade salsa was a great addition too."}
{"text":"You have to order the Breakfast Burrito with Chorizo and get the guacamole and chips on the side!! They also carry the Mexican Coke!! It all goes hand in hand!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot, and sometimes I have to actively resist going here more than once a week. The burritos are huge and filling, especially the California, which is stuffed with fries among the other goods.  Cons: -I think it's a little overpriced. The cheapest, most basic burrito (bean & cheese) starts at $5.49, and that's without frills like rice, guacamole, etc. Most of the items are over $7, with my favorites costing $8.49. A small side of guac is $1.49, and pretty standard sides (like sour cream) are also extra. I don't know where they get their ingredients from, but I could see this being justified if they're working with local providers. I know they're a small business and I'm not expecting chain restaurant prices, so I'm happy to support them regardless. I just can't eat here nearly as much as I'd like!  -Call ahead during the lunch rush; it get's pretty busy during the week, and it's pretty much a standing-room-only venue anyway.  -In my experience, they run out of carne asada on a regular basis--sometimes early in the lunch hours.  But the giant PRO is that it's delicious. Check their Facebook page for daily specials."}
{"text":"I just moved here from the southwest and the tacos at El Burro tasted like home, I had a street carne asada taco and a shredded beef taco. They were so good they made me home sick!   I was hoping salsa would have more of a kick, But this place has a cool vibe and I would be stoked to eat here again"}
{"text":"I've found the only place in Pittsburgh where  you can get a California burrito. Delicious!"}
{"text":"LOVE. Seriously, this place is delish.  We've been eating El Burro once a week for the last couple of months and we're not even close to being sick of it - if anything, we're becoming even more addicted.  The breakfast burrito (with chorizo added) is the most insanely delicious thing I've eaten in a long time - eggs, a few fries (because why not?) salsa, spicy chorizo, all wrapped in a tasty tortilla. Rich and filling enough to share.   The chicken soft tacos are consistently good, with slow-cooked white and dark meat and a thick green sauce. Topped with onions and cilantro, the only thing that makes them better is a squeeze from the lime wedge that comes alongside.  Finally, the chips and salsa steal the show, in my opinion. Chips are actual deep-fried flour tortillas (presumably their leftovers) with just the right amount of salt. They're flakey and oily and oh so good. The salsa is thin (which I love) and bright and fresh tasting - a good counterpoint to the richness of the chip.  Highly recommended. Local delivery service is a bonus for those of us living on the North Side."}
{"text":"I work in the hospital and I like coming here with work friends for lunch. The tacos are the best thing on the menu. They are always delicious (but are not as good as the ones in Las Palmas in Oakland, which taste like they are straight off the streets of Mexico). The burritos are a bit hit or miss, but I love that they grill them. I would recommend this place for an easy, fast lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Boo.  Tried it twice.  Bad ingredients.   Boo.  Open Sundays though if you like bad tacos on the weekend."}
{"text":"El Burro has a lot of potential and I'll be back after they iron things out.  The shredded beef hard taco was one of the best tacos I have ever had.  Chorizo was okay, but a little strangely sweet.  Street tacos looked excellent, but I didn't get a chance to try them.  Guac was good, but \"small\" was REALLY small (like mini condiment-size) for the price.  The salsa was gross.  It had a distinct and unusual flavor that I've never experienced before and never want to experience again (almost like an added artificial flavor--not fresh).  However, the homemade tortilla chips were perfectly crisp and salty.  For four tacos, chips and salsa, small guac, and two drinks, we paid about $30.  The setup felt a little like a late-night college post-bar spot, so the prices seemed a little high considering that.  Service was great (fast and friendly)."}
{"text":"Great Carne Asada burritos here. That's all I need with any mexican spot. Doesn't hurt that they have great customer service and I think the best salsa in town."}
{"text":"person I went with 95% sure she got poisoning from the carne asada. You can never be sure about these things, but problematic. Guac is overpriced. Our food wasn't very warm but we didn't complain so I don't really blame them. Service was really friendly though!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. One of the best burritos I have ever had. I chose the chorizo burrito with chips and guac. It exceeded my expectations.  The staff was great as well."}
{"text":"Great Tacos, Chips and Salsa are fresh and authentic. No need to waste time with any chain, or corporate South of the border places...   The Artwork and overall style is unique and shows a passion for the business. Definitely a must have for anyone looking for great Mexican eats."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try El Burro because I like the round corner so much. Well it's sad to say I do not feel the same way about this place. I had the shrimp burrito, the contents were soupy. As u could imagine it was very sloppy and runny. I ordered chips & guac as well. How could you go wrong there. I got home and opened the bag to see the chips were drenched in oil. I mean like everytime I touched a chip my fingers were glistening! I will post a pick of the bag of chips an 2hours later. i love homemade chips but they need to lay these out in a draining bin before they bag them. Very disappointing. Maybe the were just having an off day, but I don't know if I will gather the courage to try again."}
{"text":"The best shredded beef tacos.  The shells are excellent and the beef is tasty. Havent had tacos this good since the old Tacos Shop in Etna."}
{"text":"Easily the best, most authentic Mexican street food in the city. Since moving home from the West Coast in 2009, I've been praying for a place like this to sprout up somewhere in the city. Finally!!! Authentic street tacos and only a few blocks from my house.   If you're used to \"enjoying\" Americanized Mexican food like Chipotle or El Patron then you'll be in for a surprise here. El Burro is every bit a taco stand!!!  You can't miss: the Chorizo Street Style Tacos, the TJ Dog, the Carnitas Gringo Style Tacos and the housemade chips, mild salsa and guacamole.  They don't currently offer horchata but I was assured its coming in the future. Delighted!!! I can't say enough for this spot. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Thank God - actual street tacos here in Pittsburgh!  A friend caught this place on Yelp and got me and an officemate here for lunch.  What a great find.  I have been longing for street tacos since a couple of trips to Cancun and then finding a taco stand in Michigan of all places that did an amazing job with them.  Here, they are about $2.50 each and a choice of shredded beef, carne asada, shredded chicken, potato and chorizo.  I think I may have missed an option or two but they are perfect.  Just the right amount of meat, on two freshly made corn tortillas with a delicious pico de gallo and two hot sauces on the side with a slice of lime - you are set.    I got 3 street tacos (shredded beef, carne asade and shredded chicken) and a fountain drink for a little under $10.  Just the right amount of food and it was fast.  There are just a handful of seats and a lunch counter that runs all along the wall.  If you expect to eat in, get there before noon like we did.  Otherwise, not sure how the tacos will make the trip back to your home or office.  The others with me went with the burrito of shredded chicken and the extra $1 for guacamole.  They enjoyed their selection but both were a little disappointed with the light spread of guac on their burrito.  Other than that, this place was a crowdpleaser!  Maybe I'll branch out and try some of the other offerings.  But maybe not for a while until I get tired of their street tacos - this has been a long time coming to see a craving being satiated!"}
{"text":"So what's up with the potato tacos? Not something I would normally see on a menu and decide to order, but I asked the person there what we should order, and she highly recommended it. SO delicious. We also really enjoyed the vegan chorizo burrito and the sweet potato and cauliflower tacos. We asked for recommendations from the vegan menu, and we were not steered wrong. Excellent customer service too - I wanted to order one item, and the person said that that particular item was not that great that day, so maybe try something else. Talk about great service. It was clear she wanted us to have a good meal we'd enjoy. We missed from the website that it is a counter-service type restaurant, so be aware of that when you go. And you should definitely go.  We were visiting from out of town, and mostly tried vegan places, but we were drawn to El Burro for its interesting vegan menu. We were not disappointed."}
{"text":"I echo many of the comments on this thread. We have eaten at El Burro on multiple occasions and always feel unsatisfied. The burritos are hit or miss (e.g. soggy, one bite is all meat, one bite is everything else). $10 for a burrito that isn't satisfying is frustrating to say the least. I hope that they listen to our comments and make some changes!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a great review because it's in my neighborhood.  I've been a customer since not long after they opened. In the beginning the food was very acceptable.  Not great but good enough. Then the quality started to slip.  Burritos were sometimes too greasy, not every time but too often. The consistency in quality is nonexistent. One time the beans are super and the next time they have no seasoning at all.  More often then not the beans are in the bottom and everything else is in the top. Their Carne is of poor quality with a lot of gristle. The chile relleno tonight was not lightly battered and deep fried like usual. There was a big gloppy  mess of  batter in the bottom of my burrito not even attached to the pepper which was of course in the top of the burrito.  I had to return while my whole family was eating at home to get my money back and the cook felt he could justify why I was sent home with a really poor quality burrito instead of just apologizing and saying that the issue would be corrected in the future."}
{"text":"El Burro is one of the best Mexican street food places in the city. The carne asada fries are amazing as is the Tijuana dog. The tacos are hit or miss (sometimes can be underseasoned), but they are usually still pretty good. Great place for take out or eating at one of the little counters inside."}
{"text":"Stopped in again the other day for a quick lunch after a trip to the Mattress Factory.  My original sentiments about this place were completely restored.  Good food and good service.  Nice job Wes!"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Very vegetarian friendly. I really loved the cauliflower and sweet potato taco. Prices are reasonable for the quality. It's not really a sit-down type of place, but for a quick and delicious meal, it's a very good bet."}
{"text":"I'll preface this with this: I'm relatively particular about any sort of food claiming to be Mexican. I tried the California burrito, a menu item I'm generally fond of. Mine was not freshly made, perhaps since I stopped in shortly after three, so I excuse that a little. That aside, I immediately took notice of the fake shredded cheese they use. The meat did have good flavor, the guac was fine, and I did like their salsa verde. For a mediocre burrito, I'm most taken aback by the price: nine bucks for a pretty small burrito! I noticed two tacos were the same price, which I thought there's no way two tacos would be that much. After what I received, I fear that might be exactly what you get. I've had much better for half the price! I'll come back if I'm desperate, but otherwise would get more bang for my buck elsewhere."}
{"text":"Finally was able to try this restaurant today and my belly is happy about that. I had the chorizo soft taco and the chicken hard taco. Both were good, but the chorizo was so full of flavor and was my favorite of the two. The soft tacos come on white corn tortillas that are soft and warm and such a great complement to the chorizo. The chicken is good, a great base for cheese and salsa and whatever else you may choose. The hard taco shell was wonderfully crispy and hot. I tried both the medium and mild salsas and liked the flavor of both.   The special today, though I didn't try it, sounded interesting....goat meat tacos.   The service was very friendly, the prices are reasonable to me, and I can not wait to go back again and try some more of their menu items."}
{"text":"The place has good food, but WAY OVER PRICED for the quanity.  If you feel like paying $8.00 for 3 baby finger sized tacos then be their guest. I can't remember the last time that I spent $50.00 for lunch for myself and a women sitting on a stool at a counter with NO alcohol involved. Way over priced for what you get.  I'll stick to Las Palmas for my tacos."}
{"text":"Food was great and the portions were perfect. Street tacos were great I would recommend the chicken. The nachos are a must for sharing or just for yourself. My husband said the burrito was really good too. It is a very small place so big groups are not going to fit. It only has bar stool sitting area."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The staff is super friendly and the food is good.  Yes, it's a little pricey...but if you want cheap/mediocre/quasi-Mexican, you should go to Taco Bell around the corner.  My favorites:  shredded beef hard shell tacos, shrimp diablo burrito, and the carne asada fries.  I don't mind that there's only counter seating - Federal Street is not somewhere you want to sit and eat, anyway (not much in the way of a view and there's still some sketchy characters roaming about - the area is improving greatly and undergoing a renaissance of sorts).  I always phone in my order and pick it up on my way home from work.  I've never waited and never had a wrong/messed up order.  It's consistently fresh and yummy :-)  So glad El Burro is in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I wish so much this were better. Maybe they'll read this and make it so! The food is at best and environment uninviting. I love the concept but they need to hone in on the details."}
{"text":"Our food was definitely good but it was way too expensive for the amount and portions. 4 tacos and chips & a drink coming to almost $35?"}
{"text":"So I'm currently sitting here in El Burro writing this review as I enjoy literally one of the best burritos I've ever had!  I got the carne asada burrito, had them throw a little rice in it and my god I'm in heaven!  The place is small and cozy the staff are nice and the food is excellent. I'm so happy I just happened to be walking by this place while I was hungry."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING ANG AUTHENTIC!! They have vegan and vegetarian options, decent price and very friendly service :)"}
{"text":"Very pleased with nearly everything at El Burro. Great service (extra great, actually!), love the decor from local artist, and the food was pretty well done, as well as an entirely vegan/vegetarian menu.  In the area on vacation and saw this place as a good option to feed the whole family (from vegan to carnivore). They serve perfectly sized burritos, tapas-style tacos, and even taco salads (the \"flying saucer,\" add vegan chorizo and avocado salad, thank me later).  Overall meal for 4 came to about $40 with tip so not going to break the bank. The portions were very large, in the burrito realm. My dish, the flying sauce was the perfect size too for a hungry vegan.  They have sides of salsa, lots of options for all, and do a darn good job of making their customers happy. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The place is local and small business which is thumbs up.  However, I havent been blown away by any food I've had there.  Nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about either.  I stop if I am in the area to get something in a pinch but I dont go out of my way to visit.  They do have a nice mix of options for proteins and veggies, always a plus."}
{"text":"Stopped in with family during trip to Pittsburgh. Great menu, good prices. Had the potato rolled tacos. Homemade chips and freshly made salsa. Good place for vegetarians. Next time I definitely must try the vegan chorizo. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Cool little Mexican restaurant on the North Side!  Meal easily under $10.00.  There was a line when I arrived but it moved fast.  Cash and credit cards accepted. The wait was a little over 5 minutes ..but it went fast..  took some pics of the cute-themed décor - sent some texts and then my order was up.  Your first name is called out for each order which adds a personal touch.  I tried the chicken and beef soft taco.  They both were equally delicious.  It was a light meal. The hard/soft tacos are not too large in size- rather small.  The meat was slightly on the dry side, however; after a spritz of lime (that was provided) and a little hot sauce.. my taste buds were singing.   When I arrived I was able to find parking right in front but when I left which was a little after Noon there wasn't a parking spot in sight.   El Burro offers little bit of counter seating along the walls - but not really \"dine in\".  The homemade salsa was fresh and flavorful.  The menu has something for everyone... even for vegan lovers!  And get this.. even French fries are even on the menu... I just love that!   I can't wait to go back and try something else. Thanks El Burro !!!!"}
{"text":"I love their shrimp diablo burrito. Don't forget to add extras. I like it with lettuce, tomato, guacamole and cheese. Amazing! Not a ton of seating, but I usually get it to go since I'm within walking distance. A definite gem in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"They used to have the best steak tacos in Pittsburgh until they swapped out the real chunks of steak to basically Taco Bell meat. I was extremely disappointed when I learned of this transition. I actually have not returned since... Dont get me wrong, the tacos are top notch. I love the soft greasy shells and the authentic Mexican feel this place has. They also give you lime for the tacos which gives it that extra zesty taste! I also have had the pittsburgh burrito which has french fries mixed in with the burrito, it was ok but when I go to a place like this I am looking for as authentic as I can get. Still good food besides substituting the best tacos they had. I have to give it 3 stars because that was the only thing I really kept me coming back. Disappointed :-/"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos and fantastic service. The shredded chicken tacos and sweet potato tacos are spot on. They could have larger containers of salsa, and the guac was good but too creamy for me."}
{"text":"We love El Burro and they're a great addition to Regent Square. Our favorites are chicken nachos, chips and guac, and the tacos. My only wish is that they'd get a salad without a taco bowl. Service is great."}
{"text":"El Burro is a nice place to go for a sit down bite or to take out. They offer a variety of options for tacos and burritos, and cater to both vegetarians and vegans. This was something that really intrigued us as we are vegetarians and also enjoy trying vegan foods as well.  The space is not terribly large and is set up as more of a \"bistro\". You place your order at the counter and they will call your name when it is ready. We have had a couple different burritos and tacos, but what really sticks with us is the chips and salsa. The salsa is amazing and has a smokey flavor to it. The chips are homemade and taste great. The meals themselves were good, however I always have to add extra salsa or hot sauce to amp up the flavor a bit. The price can be a little high when you add on extras, but it's worth a try! Somewhere we will definitely return to over again."}
{"text":"When you think of Pittsburgh, you do not think of Mexican food.  This place makes you look twice.  The house made salsas and guacamole are a must to add to your order for the flavor alone.  Also, the vegan/vegetarian options (especially the vegan chorizo) will make anyones mouths water.  I personally love the carnitas burrito though!  I am from the east end and am so glad that they will be opening up a new location soon in Regent Square."}
{"text":"The food is good not great. I was still hungry after having a California burrito with carnitas. If you are looking for some Mexican food it will pass but it is definitely gringo Mexican food trying to look authentic."}
{"text":"Great authentic cuisine! The habanero salsa is amazing if you're looking for something that will make you sweat, probably cry if its your first time eating spicy food. I however enjoy the abuse, and have long enjoyed the  chile relleno burrito, as well as the carnitas burrito. The home made chips are also quite tasty if you're looking to splurge."}
{"text":"Please bring back the old shrimp tacos. The new tacos make no sense from a culinary standpoint, taste bitter, and are greasy. The older recipe nicely combined soft corn tortillas with fresh sweet corn, succulent shrimp, and cilantro. These new ones are apparently a \"fajita style taco\" (huh?)  loaded with greasy fried onions, bitter peppers, and lime wedges. It's an assault to the taste buds, very unappealing, and nonsensical."}
{"text":"See edit below...   1st trip review.... Definitely will come back. Perfect for the area and veg friendly. Love the refried beans and hot sauces.  Edit 7.12.17: taking this down to 3 stars, as I currently rub my aching belly. Last night, we returned to El Burro. This time, the experience was a bit off. I enthusiasticly ordered a taco with veg chorizo, but was it really? Honestly, it's my mistake not to have asked beforehand, or after, what exactly was the \"veg chorizo\" in the taco, but it certainly wasn't resemblent of the sausage-like consistency I thought it would be. (Wish I would've taken a picture.) It was crumbly and dry. Dry? . Seriously, it was orange cereal with white flecks. Weird. The refried beans, which were wonderful last time, were pasty and tasteless. I also ordered a bean, cheese, and rice burrito. The size was great! I was sure hungry. However, the distribution on cheese, beans and rice, not so hot. Lastly, as mentioned previously, my belly. Last night my family all had the bubble guts, and we're still dealing with them this morning. Mind you, we're all vegetarian, and beans are a regular part of our diet. Therefore, it can't just be that as the reason.   The bright side - amazing Guac and chips. I would stop by there solely to grab those as a snack. Very tasty.   Overall, a disappointing 2nd experience."}
{"text":"So I initially ate here and it was my favorite place to get some authentic Mexican burritos that reminded me of California and Arizona. However, I started noticing a decline in the quality of food they started turning out. The salsa was awesome in the beginning, but later it was watered down - and lacked spice. Were they trying to skimp out on ingredients and make their product last longer, or the salsa was not refrigerated and just went bad? Who knows..."}
{"text":"Yes!  Finally great Mexican food in the burgh!  Had the fish tacos they were good,  my wife had the shredded chicken taco it was melt in your mouth good! I have to return to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I've been driving past this spot for years and only just decided to step in and check it out. Really glad I did. I might have to make this a regular spot of mine. Mexican food is the way to my heart and the rolled tacos I tried were amazing! Purchased an El Burro hat to help support the business a little more."}
{"text":"For a girl who loves street tacos, these weren't bad! Definitely not the best I've ever had, but what I expected to get at a Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. I got two tacos- one carnitas, one shredded chicken. Spicy! Their tacos are $3.25 each which is a bit on the pricier side, but they were loaded, and two were very filling. I also got an order of the chips and guac, which was also a bit expensive, but worth it.   They have a ton of vegan and vegetarian options.   As far as seating goes, there's not many options, but it's perfect if you're looking to get a quick and super casual bite.   The staff was very friendly! If I were to go back I would probably get the chorizo- it seems like that might be what they're known for!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Not stereotypical fast food by any means, but has the convenience. It's not a typical sit down restaurant, but you can eat there if you'd like. The tacos are MEATY, and super filling. Dinner for two with chips, salsa, guac and drinks (not alcoholic, I don't think the serve alcohol) for $25!"}
{"text":"Awesome Real Baja Mexican! The salsas are amazing. Love the little burro collection. Perfect for picking up food for ball games."}
{"text":"Regent Square location, our second try and still disappointed. Over $9 burrito is basically a rice stuffed shell, see pics. Judging on the 5* reviews I assume they refer to ElBurroOne. I really don't like wasting time on bad reviews, but really hope this location will take a note and step up the burrito game... sad to choose chipotle over a local business"}
{"text":"As much as I wanted to like this place, I have to say I really thought the food was overrated and overpriced. First of all, I wish there were more places to sit inside. They could have really perked this place up with a sit-in area- however, obviously the space is small and carry-out is pretty much the only way to go here. I have to say the food was good, but as other people have said the quality is not much of a step-up compared to the Taco Bell down the road. I got a rice and beans burrito, which was almost 6 bucks. The fact that even lettuce and tomato are extra ad-ons is ridiculous. I don't think I've ever seen that in any comparable food chain/restaurant. As other people have said as well, the people behind the counter were not very friendly. There is a fine line between fast service with no bullshit attitude and rudeness, and the couple of people who took my order there were right on the line. I do have to recommend trying their home-made salsa that they offered me, although there is almost no spice to it. Bottom line, one should go to the Taco Bell a few blocks away for similar quality food at a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Simple and very tasty. Its a smallish restaurant that has some soul. I would return when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Move over, Chipotle, El Burro is here.  I love Chipotle burritos, but I love supporting independent businesses more. I was in the neighborhood and stumbled upon El Burro using the 'nearby' feature on Yelp. I visited on a warm, sunny, Saturday and the door and windows were open, resulting in a nice breeze throughout the small restaurant. There is not a whole lot of space there, so if you are coming with a big group I would suggest getting your order to go. Also, there are no tables, just counters, so keep that in mind. Anyway, I chose to keep it simple with the bean and cheese burrito. I added tomatoes and lettuce (no charge) and cream cheese (50 cent charge). Several other toppings are available for a la carte charges.   The service was inviting and quick, and I really enjoyed the burrito. For $8, I got a large burrito and fountain pop. In the future, I would probably get the tomatoes on the side, as it resulted in the burrito being a little too \"wet,\" but all in all, a delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"Awesome burrito and taco joint. Small, only counter against the walls seating, but great food and atmosphere. I've been here a few times and the food has always been great! Great for quick take out. The Hot Dog Taco is a fat guys dream come true."}
{"text":"Just walked here from the National Aviary which took 6 minutes.  Local vibe with enough seating for 14 people.  The whole time here we saw pick-up orders going out the door - one after another.  Food was delicious!  Seems like the chips, salsa, guacamole and everything is made fresh.    Fast and friendly service.    If you are wondering if kids will like it - let me just say - we had two teenage girls who barely eat most of the time.  They killed a burrito each and most of the large guacamole and chips.  The whole time with smiles with each bite."}
{"text":"So far best mexican in pittsburgh. recently moved to the area from chicago where you can get quality mexican food down the street. The rolled tacos keep me coming back for more! They have a delicious green sauce over top of them and are nice and crispy. The nice thing about this place is the staff are friendly and the prices are good. Their fish tacos, also amazing."}
{"text":"authentic Mexican food...you might not see many options since it is more TO GO kind of place, however they have few sittings if you want to eat there. i would've given 5 stars, but i have my reson for it :) . i eat spicy food. they give 2 sauce per order. i asked for 1 more and i was told that they give only 2! seriously! ! $9 spent on food and you can't even offer 1 extra sauce! ! i still go there...food is really good..and trust me, I've been in CA for long. ."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  My favorite is the flying saucer.  You get a little taste of everything!  Everything is fresh and tasty!  I'm so happy it's close to home."}
{"text":"I'm from Southern California and my boyfriend lived in San Diego for a couple decades, so it's safe to say we have some pretty strong opinions on Mexican food. But my boyfriend actually grew up in Pittsburgh, so we make somewhat regular visits to see his family. Over the summer we were with his brother and needed lunch on the North Side. His brother took us to this place without really telling us anything about it. Imagine our surprise when we walked in and saw a menu plucked directly out of San Diego. It's all there: California burrito, carne asada fries, rolled tacos (the latter would be called taquitos nearly anywhere else). They even had a TJ hot dog on the menu--which is not necessarily a taco shop staple, but you'd see it at food stands in Tijuana and some SD shops had started incorporating it. And it's not just the menu items that were making us homesick--even the lettering was in true San Diego fashion.  On my first visit, I just ordered a bean and cheese burrito, which is comfort food to me. I basically hold it on par with grilled cheese sandwiches in terms of simple pleasures. And the burrito was pretty nice. It is weirdly difficult to find a decent bean and cheese burrito at a taco shop in Louisville. On that visit Matt got a couple of street tacos and a TJ hot dog. They were solid as well.  On our more recent visit Matt ordered carne asada fries. I asked for potato rolled tacos but they were out, and I wasn't feeling the other rolled taco options so I ordered a carnitas street taco, a carne asada street taco, and a shredded beef hard shell taco. The street tacos were nice. Good quality tortilla (corn, obvs), cilantro, onion. The carnitas wasn't the best ever but it was solid. I didn't like the carne asada though. It was a weird texture? And it kind of tasted like seasoning more than meat. Matt's fries were still amazing despite the mediocre meat. I pretty much only ever ordered carne asada fries while intoxicated but these were tasty sober. The carne asada just wasn't good enough to stand alone in a taco, but it worked with all the goodies on the fries. My hard shell taco was ordered on a whim; I hardly ever get hard shell tacos but I knew this place would make their own shells. It wasn't the greasy perfection for which I had hoped--I like a shell that is fried moments before consumption and still oily, which I guess is super bad for you so maybe it's better that's not what they do here. Anyway, I'm not going to fault them for that, because you really shouldn't order a hard taco at this place anyway.  Overall, although the carne asada itself was disappointing, the novelty of getting carne asada fries in Pittsburgh is enjoyable enough that this place gets a solid four stars from me. I also like that they have vegetarian and vegan items on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place. I don't often go to the north side, but when I do, I make a point of stopping over at El Burro (or Nicky's Thai, if that's what I'm in the mood for). Simple but excellent burritos that are better than the ones they serve at Round Corner Cantina (same owners). No frills, but delicious.  I'm a big fan of the shrimp burritos, but really, you can't go wrong with any of them. And very reasonably priced! Definitely get the chips... they aren't necessarily freshly fried right there and then, but they are definitely fried on premises, and are addictive."}
{"text":"In short: Hipster hole-in-a-wall tex mex. Not too bad a price point for solid tacos. I love tacos with good soft tortilla shells that are slightly chewy and thick (as opposed to dry, paperlike texture). The carne asada taco was so good!! Get it!  Carnitas has pretty strong ... cinnamon? Anise? That spice flavoring they probably used to marinate/braise the meat. Just..somewhat overpowering esp for someone who isn't a huge fan of cinnamon (ikik, im weird - dont like pumpkin spice latte for the same reason). I had to slather their hot salsa on the taco to mask that flavor.  Their sauces were rly good."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a 2.5. I have been to the North Side location several times and now the Regent Square location twice. It is NOT stroller friendly to get in. There are double doors that are extremely heavy and it was difficult to get inside with a stroller. I have tried several burritos and they are typically flavorless. This week I tried a chicken quesadilla and it was much better then the burrito. For that I give it 2.5 instead of a 2. Staff was friendly each time I went. I definitely will not ever return with a stroller and will never order a burrito again."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Call ahead to get your food fast if you're in a time crunch, otherwise sit inside this cozy spot and enjoy the tasty smells of tacos of burritos. A great spot for a first date that you aren't really sure if its an actual date."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I have not actually been in the El Burro establishment - I've only had food delivered to my desk at work. I can't comment on the appearance or state of the actual building.  I CAN say, though, that wooooow, these guys make big things! It's a silly line to type, I know, but for my most recent meal I just ordered one burrito that was about $6 or $7, and it was massive - as big as and maybe bigger than a Chipotle burrito. I didn't even eat dinner that day, I was still so full from lunch!  I'd ordered the shredded beef burrito and I really liked it; the rice had been mixed in with vegetables that had been marinated in a mildly flavored sauce, so it had the teeniest of spicy kicks. I'm not a big spice person but I thought it was reasonable and mild enough that I still enjoyed it. My only complaint is that whoever made the burrito did not evenly distribute the meat. I bit into one corner and thought, \"Wow, I have a ton of shredded beef on this thing!\" And I was in heaven - that tangy beef mixing with the slightly spicy rice and veggies? Awesome! Alas, 3/4 to the end of the burrito, the meat trail ended, and I only found a few wisps of beef at the very end. It was still delicious eating the rice and veggies, but I would've loved to have a more even distribution of meat in that burrito since the beef was easily the best part of the whole ensemble.   Still, good food = I'm not going to gripe too much! Since people at work order here frequently I'm sure I'll have the chance to try more on this menu soon - if it's as good as the burrito was, I'm sure I won't have many complaints. I definitely recommend El Burro!"}
{"text":"So good! We just finished a tour of the National Aviary and looked for cheap, good eats nearby. Being New Years Eve day, we called first and the girl at the register told us they were closing in an hour, so we hightailed it over there and man we are glad we did!  My brother is a vegetarian and he was delighted to see the strictly veggie/vegan board on the wall. He got the veggie chilaquiles with fried egg and I got a hard shredded beef taco and soft carnitas taco. He loved his chilaquiles, it was too big to finish so he took it home and ate it before starting NYE partying. The meats in my tacos were delicious, tender and moist with great flavor with spices that didn't overwhelm the beefy/porky goodness.   Also got an order of chips, salsa, and guac...everything was super fresh! The salsa is very mild but still has flavor, and their specialty salsas have a kick! I got the medium and had a good tingle going on, while my bro got the habanero pineapple and devoured it while noting he'll regret it in the morning.  The service was wonderful, I wish I had caught the name of the girl at the register, because she was so nice and welcoming! Usually when you come in an hour before close, restaurant staff can get surly, but she was genuinely nice and explained various things on the menu. She even indulged my brother's need to wear the taco suit for a pic. If I'm ever back in the area, will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Texas and know good tacos.  To my surprise the best street taco I have ever had was here in Pittsburgh at el burro.  I had 2 carnitas tacos with guacamole, rice , and beans.  The freshness of the whole taco was unreal. Some corn tacos are just awful, this place knows exactly how to serve a corn taco.  They also do not skimp on ingredients, my taco was barely able to be folded in half.  This place is great and it sure is a hidden gem. Go there for your next taco craving."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem while cruising down federal street. If you're looking for an for a very unique spin in the traditional burrito or something more authentic than Chipotle, come check this place out!  I had the shredded chicken burrito with hot sauce, it was amazing. My tongue is still tingling and I have a little bead of sweat on my forehead. Ample parking, friendly staff, and great food.   Though gave it 5 stars, I will must warn you... There are a lot of homeless people congregating and drinking on the street. One of which came in the restaurant, attempting to get a free meal.   The meal was $10 without a drink, so a little more expensive that I was expecting, but still very good."}
{"text":"Good burritos! And very good service! Only reason not giving a 5 star is because they aren't super cheap and they are good burritos not amazing burritos the service I would give five out of five stars and the burritos I would give four out of five!"}
{"text":"You can't beat California's carne asada fries, but this will do if you're in the area and want yummy Mexican food!   The fries were golden brown and crisped to perfection! The meat was also very good, and I have no complaints about my meal other than the fact that it was way too salty! After a while, it was unbearable and I'm sad I couldn't finish it all. My friend told me it's not usually this salty, so I'll def have to go back in the future to try the fries again :3  The employees here are so friendly! Shout out to the person who took our order! California love to you hehe :-)"}
{"text":"Food is so fresh and delicious! Great customer service, nice little setting right on s. Braddock. We will definitely be returning !"}
{"text":"Legit comida mexicana finalmente. Although burritos are not a Mexican cuisine the rest of the menu was quite authentic. The chilaquiles were midrange spicy so don't let them fool you when they say it's not. I will return the next time I'm here to try out the tacos"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried the street tacos here a few weeks ago and were left feeling underwhelmed. The restaurant space is fun, and the service was good, but the tacos were only okay.  I don't think we'll be back anytime soon.   I tried the shredded chicken and the carnitas street tacos ($3.50 each), and thought both meats were bland and under-seasoned.  The house-made hot sauces were really good, but everything else was a bit of a let down."}
{"text":"Good food, a little expensive for what they give you. Still authentic and tasty. Very friendly service"}
{"text":"It breaks my heart to give El Burro 2 stars, it would be 0 if it weren't for the kind girl behind the register running food and orders.  I was beyond excited to get vegan tacos, after all there was a separate vegan/vegetarian menu. I was eating my second vegan taco, meat rolled out of my taco on top of some sweet potato. It was very evident that the meat was mixed in and cooked with the sweet potato.   The kitchen needs to reevaluate their cross contamination practices to avoiding serving their vegan customers meat."}
{"text":"Good Mexican-inspired Mexican-ish food.  Not owned by actual Latin folks but rather, 2 guys from San Diego, apparently.  The carne asada burrito to me, is the best burrito on the menu and the guacamole was executed very nicely (so hit or miss at most PGH area  Mexican eateries - even the Mexican-run ones...) The chips were delicious , the salsas were not so good - very thin - obvious they are cutting corners on the salsa .  No bueno  ! Parking is tricky as it's right on Federal Street .  watch your back, at night . friend of mine was held up / mugged near here awhile ago .  I'll be back for more burritos ..."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Great location and good prices, especially for the size of the burritos! Huge. Great vegan and vegetarian options. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"This might be my new fave taco place in Pittsburgh!  Have to try the beef taco & Tijuana street dog!  Super friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"It kills me to write this review as this used to be my favorite place. Seriously used to eat here at least once a week. But it seems since the other location opened the quality of this one has gone way down hill. What used to be great customer service has turned to one word mumbles from people I hadn't seen before. I've gotten two completely burnt to tasting like pure ash in a row now. My shrimp burrito has had maybe four shrimp in it. If it were one bad experience I could write it off as an off day but it's been four or five consecutively awful experiences that have led me to needing to find a new go to."}
{"text":"Let me tell you, I really don't have a lot of motivation to write this review at this moment.  Why?  Because I just ate a big ol' burrito from El Burro and I'm about to pass out.  Wow.  Tasty.  The rice, bean and cheese burrito hit the spot.  I impulsively made the decision to drive over from the East End after work to check out this place.  Glad I did.  What you'll find when you get here is a small take-out establishment that's pretty bare bones both in terms of decor, space and menu options.  You could chose to sit and eat here, though I wouldn't plan on it during peak hours as seating is limited.  What it lacks in appearance and food variety is more than made up for in execution.  I found my burrito to be 1.) gigantic 2.) fresh 3.) incredibly tasty and 4.) nicely appointed with hot-sauce that was actually hot.  Woah.  I'm docking one star because there is an extra charge for guacamole on your burrito.  That's a bunch of BS.  For what it's worth, the guac is indeed amazing.  Some of the best I've had in the city.  Nevertheless, it's a crime to charge extra for such a thing, especially with a burrito that's already priced at $7."}
{"text":"Meh. That's my description based on my first visit. I have been wanting to try El Burro for quite a while since the place is literally just a few blocks away. I love LOVE Mexican food. Usually you can find me salivating over the menus of Casa Renya, El Campesino, Chipotle, etc. You get the point.  I finally tried it out this afternoon for lunch and decided on the Carnitas Burrito. My significant other ordered the chile relleno burrito. Upon holding the burrito, I was impressed - it felt like a significant portion. When I took it out of the foil it looked good, lightly grilled even, and smelled nice. Then I cut it in half, and rice spilled out everywhere. I looked - where's the meat? Upon further inspection and subsequent eating I found the meat, but not very much. And to boot - it tasted like it wasn't seasoned at all. Very bland. All that weight of the burrito? Pretty much all white rice with a couple of corn kernels and peas and TWO cilantro leaves.... And it all tasted like... well, nothing! I had to drown it in my hot sauce here at home.  At other establishments I can barely eat an entire burrito. Here, I ate the whole thing and was very disappointed, especially after reading all these rave reviews and the price point. Now, I did have a bite of my husband's Chile Relleno burrito, and it was more flavorful than mine, but of course a pepper like that is going to have more flavor than what I had. He said it was just ok, and that for the price he expected a bit more inside the burrito other than the mass quantity of rice. I don't see myself being a regular here. Too pricy for too much rice and very little flavor."}
{"text":"Actually really like this place!    Chips and guacamole are legit.   Fish tacos have a hint of spice, pass on the shrimp tacos, carne Asada yum, and California burrito -double yum.   Give it a try...I'm a weekly visitor ."}
{"text":"Returned to El Burro and really enjoyed our visit. The carne asada fries were much larger this time so I was satisfied with the portion. Guac was really great!"}
{"text":"Not sure if the burro has gone downhill, or if I just hit it on an off night, but I wasn't nearly as impressed as before on my last visit. I had the shrimp diablo burrito, which I've had in the past, but this time it was just kind of meh. The carnitas tacos were still delicious however, and the guacamole is quite good. The chips are way too greasy in my opinion, but that's not super surprising since they're homemade. In the future, I think I'd stick to the tacos here, rather than the namesake burritos."}
{"text":"This is terrible for two reasons. One, the food is all disappointing. Very disappointing. The second and bigger issue is that it ought to be good, the east end needs a place exactly like El Burro. Identical. Cute, bright colors, friendly staff. The only change would be the food would be good. This is the kind of bad where you go to another restaurant afterwards to get the bad taste of your mouth kind of bad. Super bland meat, soggy dripping tortillas. I'm going to forget about this experience now."}
{"text":"There was a period of my life in which I lived on the North Side. In terms of delicious food, this was wonderfully dangerous to both stomach and wallet. With so many excellent restaurants within walking distance to choose from, none posed a more welcome threat than El Burro.  Burritos. That's what you need to know about El Burro. They serve a wide array of burritos including Carne Asada, Chile Relleno and breakfast. They also offer vegetarian and vegan options, which never, ever skimp on the flavor. My go to, despite never being vegetarian or vegan, is the vegan chorizo burrito. Magical, filling and oh so delicious. Include some of their in-house hot sauce and you're set.  Not in the mood for a burrito? No problem. They also offer an array of tacos (both street and crunchy,) Tons of delicious sides including chips and guac that will change your life, and the elusive Tijuana Street Dog, a hot dog wrapped in bacon, topped with queso fresco, avocado salsa, pico de gallo, and jalapenos. The prices are good and the service has always been, without exception, excellent, fast and friendly.  El Burro, my friends, is worth the trip. Always."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where I have been dying to try but the random 1 & 2 star reviews people have deterred me from making it a point to make a trip to the North Side to do so. Now, after actually being a block away and starving after a long day at AGH, I want to kick myself for putting it off.  This place is small, not air conditioned and with not a whole lot of seating.  You order at the counter and then they call you up when food is ready - maybe not the best place for a sit down date, but the perfect place for my boyfriend and I to get amazing taco takeout and stuff our faces in the comfort of our own home.  The menu is on a chalkboard behind the register.  I opted for the mahi mahi street tacos, chips and salsa and a side of guac.  My food was ready in about 5 minutes and I always say Las Palmas has my favorite tacos in Pgh (ok I said this about round corner cantinas tacos too) and I want to kick myself again for making that claim now that I've tried El Burro's fish taco.  It was served on a white corn tortilla with cabbage, cilantro and a creamy white sauce with lime on the side.  I added their salsa which I thought was a little bit smokey and their guac that was clearly fresh.  It was perfect mix of flavors and texture.  The man working the counter was very friendly.  The prices aren't as cheap as Las Palmas, but from my first time here, I have no problem paying.  I can't wait to go back this weekend.  I'm Tori and I have a taco problem."}
{"text":"Their burritos put Chipotle and Qdoba to shame. They are seriously delicious.   I live on the Northside and this is one of my standard, go-to restaurants"}
{"text":"El Burro was basically my last stop in Pittsburgh and I had an awesome time laughing with some friends and eating a mediocre burrito. I got a plain bean and cheese burrito. The cheese was good but the beans were sort of off. I think they had a spice in them that I'm not used to being in refried beans. It reminded me of the beans at Tito's Tacos in LA. Not bad just sort of funky. I was super excited that they had Jarritos. yum.  My friend accidentally ordered a burrito with pico in it and when she realized she asked them, politely, if they could keep it off. Well it was already made and she was very apologetic but still asked if they could make another one. Obviously this sucks for them and they weren't rude about it but they did keep trying to get her to take the one with pico. I know it's a pain to have to remake something, I do get that, but it just started to get kind of weird. The kept saying, \"Are you sure you don't like pico? when was the last time you had it? Don't want to try it again?\" Yeah, she made a mistake and it's inconvenient and again, they weren't rude, but by the time he finally acquiesced he could have finished the burrito already.   It's an okay burrito but there's room for improvement."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because originally I'm from California and the food looked like a taste of home. I was absolutely wrong.  I got shrimp tacos and it was the blandest mush taco I've ever had. Everything from the corn tortilla, the fajitas, and the shrimp was all flavorless and soggy. I tried the beef too; just as bland. And dry! I had gotten some guacamole on the side and ended up throwing it away because it tasted like playdoh.  This food is only good to look at."}
{"text":"We stopped here late after an acupuncture appointment.  First, they have Jarritos.  So, there's that.  I had the cauliflower and sweet potato taco off the vegan menu in a hard corn shell, and the shrimp taco duo in soft corn tortillas.  I had actually ordered all hard shells, but whatever.  The vegan cauliflower sweet potato taco was ah-mazing!  Even the shell was really good!  The shrimp tacos not so much.  The flavors in them just didn't mesh well for me, and I definitely prefer the hard shell.  I would definitely get the hard cauliflower and sweet potato taco again."}
{"text":"El Burro is a welcomed addition to the North Side. I stopped in on Saturday and tried the Carne Asada burrito and loved it. Though they were a little heavy handed on the guacamole that was fine by me because the guacamole is fantastic. The burritos are smaller than what you would get at Chipotle and I personally like that, I don't need to eat a football full of rice and beans. I'm looking forward to becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"A great place to pig out. I came here with my family and we got to try a bit of everything - calif burrito, shrimp diablo burrito, chilaquiles, carne asada fries, and a chorizo taco. everything was great and the portions were huge. We got way too much food for the four of us. Standouts were the calif burrito (yes it has fries!) and the carne asade fries, which were fries loaded up like nachos.  They also had a bunch of salsas ranging in spiciness and they were all really fresh and good! There's a array of sodas, but it's BYO for beer and such.  The space is small and there's no wait service, but the person working was very sweet and attentive. She actually even spoke Chinese, which my Chinese parents thought was very cool haha.  I definitely recommend this place and look forward to coming back some time!"}
{"text":"Tacos!!!  I love this place!  A little hole in the wall and the tacos are amazing!  The staff is quick and the food is awesome.  I love the sauces and the soft tacos are perfectly proportioned!  I'm not vegan but there are options for that too.  I don't know why you wouldn't get the pork though. . ."}
{"text":"I stopped by with CM this past Sat. around 5pm after a visit to the Mattress Factory for a quick snack.  We were a bit hungry, but weren't necessarily up for a full dinner. I whipped out my trusty Yelp app and saw that El Burro was an establishment nearby that I'd bookmarked, and CM said he was up for Mexican. Thus, we decided to brave the quasi-sketchiness of this end of Federal St. to check it out.    The first thing that immediately became apparent upon walking in was that there were no tables--only a handful of counter seats on either side.  Between that and observing other customers, it's pretty clear that most of El Burro's business is take out.  Undaunted, we decided to get a few tacos and settle in to eat them at the counter.  CM and I both ordered two chicken tacos in hard shells ($3.75 each), and I also got a bottle of Tamarind El Jarritos soda ($2.29).  The tacos were served about 5 min. after ordering.  Unfortunately, though they had appropriate textural variation, I found them bland in flavor.  The skimpy portion of red salsa served on the side, while hot, added little flavor to them.  No guac or sour cream was included, which was disappointing--apparently, you have to pay extra for it.   Unfortunately, I feel that El Burro epitomizes what's wrong with the Mexican food scene in PGH--Mexican food is supposed to be bold and flavorful, not bland!  Between the blandness of the tacos and the price that we paid (over $16), it just wasn't worth it.  In retrospect, after looking at the photos, we would have been better off ordering two flying saucers instead of the tacos.  If you're looking for delicious, inexpensive tacos, I recommend Edgar's in the Strip or Las Palmas in Oakland.  TBH, I probably wouldn't return unless someone insisted on it--or unless I was stuck in the North Side without cash, as was the case on Sat."}
{"text":"Admittedly, my standards of Mexican food are pretty high because I had a Mexican grandmother who was a great cook, and I lived in SoCal for almost 8 years.  So I know from my burritos and tacos.  I opted for the special burrito, a chile relleno.  I was pleasantly surprised by how big, filling, and delicious it was.  Also, when I see a burrito that has that nice translucent property when its heated, I get excited.  That means I'm going to get a nice, chewy experience.  I also had the chips and guacamole.  The price point on the latter was pretty high for the serving size, I think.  As is the jump from the smaller to the larger size--I'd consider what they call a large a medium.  And it was pricey.  It was at least decent guac, and the chips were admittedly greasy, but that's not necessarily a turn-off for me.  Especially since it was clear that they were made in-house.  The space is cute because they definitely keep with the Burro theme, as they are all over the restaurant.  It's small and casual; just counter seating. So it's a great place to end a night, or start one where you want to eat well for cheap and them move on to someplace else like my date and I did, haha.  If I lived closer, I could see myself coming here regularly."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than authentic Mexican cuisine.  Nothing can beat it.  It is always a nice surprise to find a place that offers what you crave at that moment.  I stopped in here one day so I could basically grab and go.  This place, at least to me, that is what you should do.  You can eat inside, but it's not your typical restaurant.  There is a bar like area along the wall with stools, but if you are expecting to have a full meal here comfortably, it's not going to happen.    After struggling with the menu, and not in a bad way, I finally made my choice on what I wanted.  I needed a burrito.  There are plenty of different types of burritos here that you can come back everyday of the week and still have a new adventure each day.  Just to be safe I asked what the tortilla was made from...flour if you are wondering.  I went with the shredded beef burrito which, if you were wondering, is much better than a ground beef burrito.  With this you get rice and pico.  Now, just so you know, this will have corn in it.  Not a problem for some of you, but it is for me as I have an allergy to it.  I even mentioned that I had this allergy when ordering.  But I suffered through it anyway.  It was that good.  I suppose you could gauge how good it was if I was going to take the risk of having to use my epi-pen.  Would I attempt this again, absolutely, but I do not advise to others.  Drinks are available in both bottled and fountain variety."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always fresh ingredients, and can't resist chips and salsa every time I go!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! I live so close and finally had it for the first time. I ordered online and picked up. The nachos were amazing and I also ordered a quesadilla. Both were delicious! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Simple, delicious tacos. I had their tacos the first time I ate there, and they are so tasty that I haven't tried anything else. Mexican style, just the way they should be, with two soft corn tortillas, meat, onions, a little cilantro, and one of their tasty sauces (I'm partial to the verde).  The chicken is flavorful and moist, which is sometimes hard to come by. The potato tacos are good, but a little spicy for my taste.  The chorizo is perfectly spiced and that little bit of drippy grease to let you feel just the right amount of indulgent.   One complaint: they seem to have changed the carne asada from hunks of meat to ground meet. THAT WAS THE BEST ONE WHY DID YOU MESS WITH IT? The ground meat is fine, but before it was SPECTACULAR."}
{"text":"We just went to the new El Burro. The carnitas and shredded chicken burritos were tasty. But, I don't want to pay $9 for a burrito and not have a place to sit. They will have 8 stools soon. Then we can relax and enjoy. Remember the old Toula's...or trying to forget? Thank you developer Bill Baron and CNNC development cmt. A step in the right direction."}
{"text":"Really impressed with this place. The burrito I had (shredded chicken) was excellent and the chips and especially the salsa were really good too. The hot salsa was awesome, pretty hot! Seating is a little tight and the location isn't great but this place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is a good and quick spot for lunch. We stopped in on Saturday afternoon and hubs got the street tacos: chicken, beef, and carnitas. He wasn't a fan of the chicken. It didn't taste quite right. The others were much better, with the carnitas being his favorite.  I had the chili relleno burrito. It was pretty good, but had more cheese than I cared and there was an element of friedness. It was quite heavy and a filling option. By dinner time, I still wasn't hungry.   Tip: there are several hot sauce varieties on the table, but not salsa. I didn't get any for my burrito. Hubs got two small containers of hot salsa for his tacos.  The spot itself is small, with various barstool spots. It is better suited for grab and go."}
{"text":"El Burro has some of the best burritos in Pittsburgh. Also, their chips & salsa is awesome. Their chips taste homemade & their salsa is homemade & has just the right amount of spice (not too spicy). I love their breakfast burrito which comes with egg, cheese, fries & pico. I tried their potato taco & fish taco one time & I wasn't really impressed. The tacos were kind of dry & not a lot of flavor. I'll stick with their burritos. Highly recommend El Burro."}
{"text":"Best Tex-Mex tacos this side of the Mississippi River! House made hot sauce with a kick and good flavor. Order ahead online to beat the lunch rush. Ignore the dumb-ass simpering white boy customer complaining that the beef was \"too spicey\" last taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses. Not satisfying at all  Chiliquilllies were plain nasty. Soggy chips with green sauce. Waste of $8  Beans have no flavor. No salt, no garlic, pepper or onions.  My cheese in the bean and cheese burrito wasn't melted. Nothing beats a Taco Bell bean burrito   Shredded beef taco was the best.  Carne asada burrito was full of onions from guacamole and the meat chunks were chewy, tasteless and too big  The fresh salsa was made from  un ripened tomatoes, had no heat or cilantro   Too bad the $8 per burrito locks you into buying the whole thing.  Casta rasa, round corner cantina and the taco stand in front of Reyna foods has way better casual tacos  They charge for chips and salsa.   Chips look double fried because they are very greasyy  A waste of $35 and the food left a bad taste in our mouths"}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out for lunch yesterday, since I was in the area. I've heard a few good things about this place and was looking forward to trying it out myself. I ended up going with the chorizo burrito with crumbly cheese and their habanero salsa. The burrito was underwhelming in my opinion. It's a tad pricey, has too much Spanish rice for filler, and minimal chorizo. Overall, it was a bit too bland and dry for me. Also, I'm not positive the cheese made it into my burrito. The habanero sauce was tasty though. It was not extremely hot and therefore manageable for anyone who likes some heat, but I only got enough on the side for half my burrito. I will try again at some point, but I'll be honest, I went to Chipotle for dinner to get the fix I was looking for later that day."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Service is fast, and the food is always fresh. They make their own chips and salsa, which is super tasty. I recommend the chorizo tacos and the chicken rolled tacos. The sides like the rice and beans are good too!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! Food came out hot, looked and tasted great. Staff was very friendly and efficient. Atmosphere was chill but not dead. Diverse customers. Great variety of menu options for most eating preferences and a decent price. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Where is the real Mexican food in Pittsburgh? I came here because its in my neighborhood and someone posted a pic of the carne asada fries and I knew those had my name written all over them. I had the diablo shrimp burrito. Surprise! Tomatoes in your burrito! I'm not a fan of raw tomatoes and I could have done without that surprise. The shrimp was so so spicy but on a whole the burrito was bland. I also ordered the carne asada fries which are great in theory but lacked seasoning. Would I come back? Sure, you gotta support neighborhood businesses. But next time I'll try the tacos."}
{"text":"I was torn between a 3 and 4 star review. I wish I could give 3.5 stars. We've been to the North Shore locations several times, both for takeout and dine in. Food is either very good (with the addition of their hottest salsa) or just average. This last trip, we both got the California burrito and enjoyed it. Lots of steak that was flavorful and juicy. Neither of us could finish it. But their sizes seem to be inconsistent depending on who is in the kitchen. Their rolled tacos are also good. Only 3 stars because I think with Tako and Condado opening, El Burro's prices just don't match the flavors. $8 for a container of guacamole at a takeout place is a little crazy. Also, it'd be great if they had a list of their salsas on the menu - I think people are missing out on some of the spicy options that add flavor."}
{"text":"I love el burro! I'm actually addicted to their (vegan) chili relleno burrito!! Guacamole and salsa are made in house and are so so good! Definitely order chips, guacamole and salsa with your burrito/taco. They do have a taco Tuesday special and a lot of other specials throughout the week. There's not a lot of dining space, definitely a more hole in the wall place, but that's what I love about it! If you've never been here, definitely check it out, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good vegetarian and vegan options! I can't comment on the meat items but the breakfast burrito is great with hot sauce! The chips and guacamole were great as well. Glad this came into the neighborhood."}
{"text":"El Burro is a good addition to the Regent Square neighborhood. The food at El Burro can be good and it's something different.  The biggest issue is consistency. The service is always good, but the food is not made consistently the same way. One day it's spicy, and another day it's dry and tasteless. Consistency is the key to success and why I gave them only two stars."}
{"text":"I came here for the first and only time a couple months back and was very disappointed .    The food was very tasty but the portions were so tiny; I have Dachshund and I think even he would bark about the portions. Honestly guys I could eat 15-20 of these tacos no problem.   If you are down to drop $30 on tacos you could probably leave this joint without being hungry.  I actually went to chipotle 20 minutes after this meal because my three tacos were so unfulfilling.  I hate to leave a two star review for a place that served delicious food, but the portions were microscopic and the prices were astronomical.    Not a good value, overhyped, and overrated.  If you want an authentic taco, you are better off taking a trip up the road to the Strip district!"}
{"text":"Every time I eat here I wonder why I don't do it more. The food is fantastic! It's simple, delicious and best of all, close to home! Oh, and don't forget to try to the Carne Asada Fries, Fries never tasted so good!"}
{"text":"It a place to sit and relax. Space is a bit cramped. Menu prices  are a little high for what is more like a taco stand than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow.  Seriously authentic Mexican street food in Pittsburgh.  They even have Mexican Coca-Cola (with sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup).  An instant hit.  Great for a bite when you're visiting the National Aviary or Children's Museum on the north side."}
{"text":"Decent affordable food. I will have to update since I didn't order much.   I had 2 chorizo tacos. Tacos are $3.50 & extremely basic....... meat, cheese and lettuce. Not very  authentic.  Again super cute, fast cheap meal but very basic."}
{"text":"The burritos are ok. We had a chorizo burrito, a shredded beef burrito, and a carne asada burrito. Mine (shredded beef) was loaded with too much rice. The others were a little more balanced. For $9 a burrito i was expecting a more. I brought some Mexican friends with me and we all thought the restaurant was so-so. The place has seating but it's better suited for takeout."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service. Mix the salsa together for a special treat!  Great location, good atmosphere. Had an awesome time.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"El burro is OK. Feel like they skimp on meat in burritos, give me too much rice, and dont even include sour cream or cheese. The fried \"taquito\" esque creations are OK as well. Prefer the strip or taco truck. This place seemed so great at first, but it lacks in flavor and bang for my buck. Taco truck might be pricey but at least their tacos have flavor, for example. And i pay about $10 for a burrito here when I could get a better tasting one with more meat at Chipotle. Sorry dudes. Im sad to say it too. Maybe you can switch up your flavor game and save the burro."}
{"text":"This place was the bomb diggity. I was recommended the carnitas burrito. It was gigantic and delicious. Their chips and salsa are different, but remind me of the kind you'd actually find in Mexico=yummy. The hubby had chorizo tacos and I tried a bite. My god, the deliciousness you would not believe. Like a good taco? Go here!"}
{"text":"I had the soft tacos and they were yummy. The hot pineapple salsa is good but I wish there was more to add to the tacos. Good price and fast service. Only a few seats inside. Cashier's customer service could use some work. I'd like to come back for the fish tacos and rolled tacos but Edgar's is still #1"}
{"text":"I was very glad to see a burrito/taco joint move into the neighborhood. I have been hoping for this for years. And, for some reason, I keep ordering from their even though it's pretty bad. Out of approximately 10 burritos, only one was edible.  The other 9 we separated into a few bites of meat, then a few bites of rice and so forth. And why do their burritos require an additional charge to add beans or cheese? Are they not staple ingredients of a burrito? The chips are greasy and the salsa has no flavor. The tacos while they are not offensive, they are far from good or filling. In the end, I think the owners should probably try other taquerias in the area or restaurants in general. Also, training your cooks how to roll a burrito, so the food is evenly mixed, should not take weeks. Also, handing out a tiny container of house-made sauce doesn't cover up enough for bland food. I have even emailed the restaurant my thoughts in a far friendlier email....no response. If you want to try to eat there, I recommend soon, I fear it may not last. Viva whoever replaces this dump...."}
{"text":"Very good! Everything is cooked and seasoned to perfection! Their guacamole is to die for!! It's a little hole in the wall but their very quick and accommodating"}
{"text":"Second time eating here. Have only gotten the California Burrito and the chips and salsa. Not disappointed by any means. The meat is good, the sizes are on par, and their fresh chips are AMAZING! I love their salsa with the chips, you can taste the cilantro, the salsa has a cool and almost fruity aftertaste. I see the reviews here complaining about portion size and meat quality and I'm a bit taken aback by that. It's a small, locally owned and relatively new business, especially to Regent Square. I have ZERO complaints. And my picky, early teenage daughter is a fan, also. I say GOOD JOB El Burro. The mild and hot sauce are tremendously good. My boyfriend loves the hot, especially on the burrito and I love the mild."}
{"text":"Despite being a mostly take-out type restaurant, El Burro is visually inviting--lots of colorful decorations and cute little donkeys, true to their namesake. Their menu is pretty straightforward, mostly in the way of burritos and tacos. When we came in they had $1 specials off the carnitas and chicken burritos. I am not sure if they have this kind of thing on rotation regularly, but it was enough motivation for us to get one of each.   The burritos were definitely a decent size for the reasonable price. They were very photogenic too, nicely wrapped with cilantro sprinkled around a lightly grilled tortilla wrap. Lots of good filling, with cheese, beans, rice, and some veggies. They offer a number of sauces/fillings that you can add for no extra charge, so those were a nice bonus. I'd say that the flavor here is just slightly less than what you'd typically find for Mexican food, but that's fine if that's what you're after sometimes. In terms of burritos though, I'm pretty happy to say that I found my go-to place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The Burrito itself was alright! I was excited to try it because the shredded chicken was halal and that's a plus, however I felt like the burrito was a little small for the price that it cost"}
{"text":"I'd like to make my deep love for El Burro known. I would write love letters to these incredible tacos if I wasn't fearful of spilling salsa on them. What a fantastic neighborhood find, thanks again to Yelp! Lots of vegetarian choices and variations of those choices. The potato tacos are mouth watering, with flaky flour tortillas, fresh veggies, and chunks of potatoes cooked in some magical spice that makes me crave them nightly. The rolled potato tacos are a surprisingly huge portion of 4 taquito type goodies with loads of cheese and fresh pico. There are tons of different burrito options, I think 11 in all, many vegetarian or having veggie friendly possibilities. Oh, and some have french fries, which makes my inner fat kid squeal with delight and feel naughty at the same time. I adore that they have vegan chorizo and the breakfast burrito is definitely worth tasting, even though those potato tacos are difficult to pass up!  El Burro has the best salsa I've ever tasted. I guess this is controversial since other reviewers seem to find it too thin or even runny. I don't care about chunks, apparently, just flavor. And this stuff has it! Perfect amount of kick to compliment those homemade chips. The guacamole is good, although they don't give you much of it on the side. They carry Mexican Coke (sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup) and other south of the border bottled beverages which only adds to the El Burro vibe and experience. This is primarily a take out joint, although I suppose you could eat there if you wanted. There just isn't much seating, just a handful of stools at a couple counters. Order at the counter or call ahead. The staff is super friendly and knowledgable. And it's cheap! $2.95 per taco, $5-$6 for rolled tacos, $6.95 for burritos, $2.95 for chips and a huge container of salsa.  I'm so delighted to have El Burro as my new neighbor. Definitely crave-worthy food has come to Federal Street, and I could not be happier!"}
{"text":"first time here. Just ate the chili rellenos burrito with added lettuce and pico de gallo. So delicious!!  Couldn't stop eating. :)."}
{"text":"4 stars just for being a little pricey. Today I got a shredded chicken burrito. It comes with chicken, rice and pico de gallo. It was okay..."}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat around. The burritos are sizable and delicious, love the way they toast the top and bottom a little bit. California burrito is one of the best, but the burritos are all wonderful, and the tacos as well. They have some other menu items that are good too, like the Tj street dog, or the chilaquiles. I personally love the breakfast burrito with chorizo or bacon. Just found out recently you can get the burritos as a bowl, which I'll have to try more. Also, it seems like every other week they have a special that is vegan for those interested.  The price is a little more than you'd pay for chipotle, but it's also better. They have that new online order system which is pretty convenient. I wouldn't be concerned about them not following hours, that has never happened to me and I have been here many, many times.   Overall, it's a great local burrito joint that you have to try at some point. I'm getting hungry just thinking about all this."}
{"text":"What's cool; Local, Unique Mex food, Vegan and Vegetarian friendly  What's NOT; price point is way too high for what you get, so far only thing that's been filling is the chilaquiles.   Biggest disappointment were the Vegan Rolled Potato Tacos, I could barely tell there was anything inside (maybe that's what makes it vegan?) definitely didn't taste potatoes. It was more like a greasy rolled corn tortilla the size of a taquito.  El Burro is a small, hole in the wall, Mexican street food inspired type of restaurant.   Seating is limited so this is more of a grab and go place.  But if you choose to stick around you're transported by the authentic art and community events adorning the walls.  The concept is simple but unique and you're sure to find a couple items you haven't had elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love their tacos!! Really great carne asada tacos. The only downfall is that the tortillas rip pretty quickly so you gotta eat them fast. Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Update: It was brought to my attention that those were not actually nachos, but chilaquiles. I came back for another burrito (still pretty good), a potato taco and the real nachos. I really liked them! You could probably order just the nachos in place of burritos if you wanted to because they are large, filling, and have a ton of toppings. I like that this place has a vegan menu. The flavors of the potato taco were good and I liked the tortilla, but the texture of the potatoes themselves were a bit starchy. I would recommend changing the type of potato.  Original: I had some take out and it was actually better than I thought it would be. The reviews made me very nervous, but my brother frequents this location and I thought I would give it a try.   I had nachos and a bean and rice burrito. The burritos are large and filling. Not overdone with the cheese and the rice was good. The beans were a bit plain but overall it was very acceptable. The nachos were crisped and pretty oily. Unfortunately, there was a green salsa on top that made the chips very, very soggy in a short period of time. The taste overall was good, the texture grossed me out by the end because I hate soggy food.   I would like to try some things from here again and see it maybe other menu items are more flavorful. I will say this: the guacamole with the side of chips is good!"}
{"text":"I will never stop being thankful that El Burro exists; I never expected to find exceptional vegan tacos in this tiny North Side shop. Today, I had a really lovely sweet potato & cauliflower taco in a soft corn shell, and on my last visit I had a delicious vegan chorizo burrito. 4/5 stars because the chicken burrito I had one of the prior times I came (that visit was about a year ago) was just okay.. But seriously my visits since that chicken mediocrity have only increased my love and appreciation for this place. Five stars will most likely come in the future."}
{"text":"I got the shrimp taco, the shreddded beef taco, and the carnitas taco.  The shrimp was well cooked, but i didnt like the flavor of the taco at all. It had a warm, somewhat spicy salsa and grilled bell peppers. It made the tortilla soggy.  I couldn't tell which one was carnitas and which one was shredded beef, but one of them was very good and one of them was very ok. Both of them had a lot of meat and the traditional cilantro and onions on it. The tortillas on these didn't get soggy.  Overall, i found the tacos to be a little disappointing aside from the one unidentified taco. The burritos look good though, so i want to come back and try one.  Edit: The shrimp taco is served fajita style, so everything makes perfect sense. I guess that's just not my style. The one on the far right of my picture was the one I liked a lot, and it turns out that that was the carnitas taco.  Edit: Upgrading to 4 stars because the burritos are fire. I got a california with carnitas. The juicy meat with the rich guac and fries plus tangy cheese and salsa in a chewy tortilla with a grilled crispy exterior? Great burrito! I didnt like the TJ dog too much though."}
{"text":"Got take out from here after recommendations from 2 different friends. I got 2 shredded beef tacos, carne asada fries and my hubbie got a carne asada burrito. We were very pleased, particularly with the fries. They were so good! Now, I don't know what authentic carne asada fries are supposed to be, having lived in PA my whole life, but my friend from Texas says these are close to the real deal. The guac was really good, and my husband raved about the burrito for nearly 10 minutes after it was gone. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My roommate and I ordered el burro dos through Postmates last night. It was absolutely delicious. She had the California burrito and I had the bean and cheese burrito and rice and we split the chips and salsa. Everything was cooked to perfection and you can tell it was assembled with love. Thanks for the delicious meal and for looking out for us vegetarians! Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I love a Southern California Mexican restaurant (the owners moved from San Diego to open in Pittsburgh) and I was excited when I saw the menu for El Burro. The chips were great, and the salsas/hot sauces and tacos were good. They give you the option for hard or street tacos.   I ordered a carne asada taco (which is typically hard to find in Pittsburgh) but I think they gave me a ground beef taco so I want to go back and try the carne asada as well as the California burrito."}
{"text":"What a great find for lunch!   The food here is excellent. Everything is prepared extremely well. The burritos are toasted to perfection. The rice is on the harder side, for that better mouth feel. The meats are so well cooked and seasoned. The veggies are crisp!  Wes is one of the owners of the shop and he's very friendly and expedient. He'll recommend a few good hot sauces he has for you to try with the burrito.  The burritos here are definitely not on the heavy & sloppy side - they're not loaded with cheese or fats just to get flavour in. No, everything is prepared in a super clean-tasting way that I just would never expect when I have a burrito. Would definietly come back here when I visit Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"Gonna start my review by saying, I was born and raised in San Diego. I only moved to Pittsburgh 3 years ago and during that time, I've hunted tirelessly (and to no avail) for some acceptable Mexican food. When I moved to Regent Square I was super excited to try out El Burro. Their menu is pretty comparable to a standard San Diego taco shop. There's a California burrito listed, so the place is clearly drawing it's inspiration from there. Unfortunately the Cali burrito doesn't quite measure up. I know I'm biased (like super duper snobby biased) but the carne asada was so dry and not super tasty. It also should be cut into small cubes, but this one was essentially ground meat, which leaves much to be desired. The salsa options are also all red, instead of the usual red/green options, which is a bummer. All in all, the thought and attention to detail is there, but the follow through left me disappointed"}
{"text":"Fantastic burrito. We ordered pickup and the girl at the cash register flirted with my friend the whole time. It was fun!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place but am let down every time I go there. The execution just isn't there for the food. There are a couple of items that are ok, but not good enough to go back that often."}
{"text":"Just stopped here for the first time and the Fish Tacos are some of the best I have ever had.  Large portions of Mahi Mahi that were expertly battered and fried.  The batter was very light and extra crisp.  I believe the toppings were salsa verde, sour cream, minced white onions, finely chopped cilantro, and cabbage.  Two to an order and they are quite large.  I got the soft shell version, which I would recommend considering the fish is already fried and crispy.  Fast and friendly service.  I also tried the carnitas, pulled beef, and pulled chicken tacos in the fried shell version.  All were pretty good, but not as wonderful or as large as the fish tacos.  Can't wait to head back for the best fish tacos I have found in Pittsburgh!!!  Probably not a place to dine with a large group, as the only place to sit is counter seating, but plenty of space for a few friends if they're not too busy.  They look to do a lot of take out business."}
{"text":"My first trip to El Burro, my neighborhood's new burrito shop/taqueria, was this afternoon.  I won't say much about the speed and service, which wasn't the greatest in the world, because it's really only their first day open to the public.  They had a \"soft opening\" last night, and their full menu isn't even in production yet.  But it's worth waiting for them to work the kinks out because the food is FANTASTIC.  My husband ordered a carne asada burrito and loved it.  It was gigantic. I got the rolled potato tacos (wanted street tacos, but they aren't yet available), and they ended up being AMAZING.  I was surprised when I opened my take-out container and found four giant taquitos smothered in guacamole, pico de gallo, and cheese.  We also shared an order of chips and salsa.  Both are homemade.  Seriously, is there anything better than fresh, homemade tortilla chips straight out of the fryer?  I think not.  Heaven.  Their salsa is mild, with a cilantro-y kick.  I liked it, but ended up adding hot sauce.  Right now, this is pretty much take-out only, which is fine with me since it's a block from my house.  However, the inside of the restaurant is lined with bar counters so I think they will probably add stools eventually for an eat-in option, but even now, you could stand and eat at the counter if you wanted.  I am so, so excited to welcome El Burro to the neighborhood!  If you're on the north side, give them a try!"}
{"text":"The food here is not awful, but it's also not very good.   On my first visit I got the carnitas burrito. It was just underwhelming. The meat was seasoned differently than I'm used to (no heat or mild chili flavor, very little cumin or garlic, instead it was almost sweet and cinnamon-y). It wasn't bad, but it wasn't terribly flavorful. There were no beans or cheese inside, literally just bland rice and a tiny bit of Pico. This is as the menu described, but I somehow thought there had to be more to this burrito. It was pretty small considering it was almost $9. The hot salsa on the side was good, though, and made the burrito somewhat enjoyable.  I decided to try El Burro again, and ordered the California burrito, as it had many positive mentions on Yelp. This was not at all good. The \"carne\" was greasy, unseasoned hamburger meat. I mean, REALLY greasy, like pouring-all-over-the-place greasy. There were literally 3 fries on it, the cheese was somehow not melted, and the guacamole was the bland kind that makes me never want to eat guacamole again. The salsa Verde I got with this did little to add flavor.  I might try this place one more time, because it is one of the few options near where I work, and I want so badly to like it. I'll update my review if the tacos outshine the burritos."}
{"text":"I have to say that Pittsburgh has become pretty saturated with decent taco places. While I do wish that someone would come up with another food inspiration, I can't help but understand why the taco is the obvious choice. A good tortilla can hold an endless amount of imaginative food combinations and, if done right, can really satisfy any hunger your body may encounter.  That being said, I have been hearing delicious things about El Burro for a really long time. Despite how often I'm in the Northside (read Parkhouse), I had yet to have gone until recently. Waiting this long was a huge mistake! All of these years I could have been feasting on delicious burritos and tacos instead of getting drinking ginger beers down the street! I had their special of the day which consisted of two chicken empanadas, rice and refried beans. The rice was ok. The beans were awesome and definitely fresh. But the empanadas were, by far, the best part. They were so simple and almost elegant. Chicken and cheese in a crispy corn meal shell, topped with lettuce and cilantro. There was also fresh (and very hot) salsa that made the meal perfect. Both myself and my guest devoured our meals in mere moments. I can't wait to go back and try more! This might become a problem. At least it's healthier than drugs."}
{"text":"Love this place from the decor to its location to the incredible tacos. Clean, rustic and simple on the inside, it is nestled right across from some great dive bars in the East End.  Grab some brews at Murphys or the Maproom and buzz on over here for some great tacos. 2.50 a taco for genuine tacos, from the tortilla down to the meat and the sauce. Simple great food will trump famous names and fancy restaurants all day in my book."}
{"text":"Outstanding Chile Relleno Burrito.  A hidden gem on the North Shore for quick, high quality Mexican."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I'm always on the look out for new delicious options. Also, as a huge fan of Mexican food, I've been dying for a California-style meal that didn't disappoint.   As a result, El Burro is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh and the epic poems I would write in honor of their rice, bean, and cheese burrito would feature whole stanzas about how delicious their rice is or how the only thing that comes close to comparing is their nachos with soyrizo. It may end with a battle between the nachos and burritos where everyone wins and celebrates with delicious and fresh Mexican food.  Also, El Burro needs to deliver to the East End so I can eat it all of the time and attain my wish of always having easy access to delicious burritos."}
{"text":"The first thing we did when we came to Pittsburgh was look for a good Mexican place. We're not talking about texmex, but California burritos, carne asada fries, etc.. and el burro is the place. Not only do we come here to get our SoCal Mexican food fix, but we've ordered 80 tacos for a party before and they did a great job with them. Delicious!"}
{"text":"We arrived 10 mins before closing and the woman at the counter was helpful and friendly and let us finish our meal while she cleaned up. The burritos were awesome. We got the spicy shrimp and the chili rellano (great idea for a burrito). Both were awesome. They also have a rotating vegan special daily and vegetarian beans. We were jut visiting Pittsburgh but will definitely make it a stop every time we come through. Friendly, fast and really good!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the better burritos I've had in Pittsburgh, but I'm afraid that isn't saying much.  The eggs in my breakfast burrito were extremely overcooked, and I didn't really like the pico de gallo... it was basically just some bland mushy tomatoes inside the burrito. Also didn't understand the sprinkling of clearly old, dried out chopped cilantro they put on top of the burrito.  It was also a pretty big hassle to get extra containers of salsa. The guy at the register pointed us to some sriracha sauce when we asked what their hottest salsa was, definitely not what I had in mind! I think it would be much better if they had a little salsa/toppings bar to let people serve themselves."}
{"text":"A quick and delicious lunch while we were in the area visiting the Children's Museum. I had the Carnitas Burrito, my husband had the California and our 3 year old enjoyed street beef tacos with all the trimmings. Our wait time was short and several other people were enjoying/picking up meals at the same time."}
{"text":"Good tex-mex food.  Guac is really, really good.  Staff is very helpful and friendly.  It's a go-to spot in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite to eat before I headed over to the Elks for Banjo Night. Though the website says they're open until 9, we walked in at 7:45 and were told that they close in 15 minutes at 8pm. I'm usually not one for sticking it to restaurants with last minute orders anymore, but my friends were persistent and we ordered anyhow.   My friends all got tacos and burritos. Everyone was satisfied, including me and my two yummy carnitas tacos. The lime I had was dried out to no end, but that's the price you pay when you go to a place 10 mins before closing. Not the best taco I had, but certainly not the worst. If I'm ever on this side of town again I'd give it another try."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican spot in the 'burgh!!! The rolled tacos are definitely a winner but anything on the menu is . Great company and friendly staff. I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I got 3 tacos, all different kinds because I wanted to try what they had. I was happy with the beef being shredded, all of the tacos I had were seasoned well. I ordered them on corn tortillas and they only came with cheese and lettuce. The cheese was just a taco cheese blend, not very impressed. The lettuce was iceberg which is fine, but for a taco that is $3.50 could you use something with better quality? The prices of the tacos were a bit much for what you got on them. I would go back, but I would probably try something different. Taco shells were awesome.  This place is something to try, but I don't think it is worth the money for being in North Side."}
{"text":"I LOVE MEXICAN.  Now that we've established that, let me tell you El Burro's tacos are delish. Makes sense as this is the sister site to Round Corner Cantina. I'll admit to having only tried the tacos ... and only two of the tacos ... but the carne asada is so good! I finally broke down and tried the shrimp tacos which were so, so, so, so good.   The people who work there are really friendly, too. Probably helped that when they first opened I visited 3 days in a row.   I don't know how much I can say in this review that hasn't already been said (small place, not much seating, mainly take-out). There's also the small problem of me ordering the same thing over and over again."}
{"text":"El Burro is one of the first real Mexican food joints in Pittsburgh. By that I mean it's a proper taqueria and not Taco Bell style.   I've been here multiple times and often boast about its friendly owner and it's legitimately good tacos. I can't eat beans so I cannot attest for the burritos, but the tacos are on point. All of them. The only thing keeping this from five stars is the consistency in taste and quality. There will be times where the carne asada tacos are the best and times where they weren't as good(this goes for the churizzo as well). This often happens when the chef is \"eyeing up\" the recipe and not keeping it consistent, or when they have to quickly make a new batch because they ran out of the first. Those feeling aside, I would say the food is reasonably priced (would be perfect if they were consistent) and I would recommend El burro to anyone.  (Keep in mind North Shore can get shady at times so visiting during reasonable hours and with a friend is probably a good idea)"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about El Burro is the owner. Both of the locations are comfortable and exactly what you want out of a taqueria. They also elevate the neighborhoods they are in just by adding culture. What pains me is the fact that they just aren't consistent enough. The joy of going to taquerias like Doce or Condado is that I have my favorites and I can get them every time. El burro has it's positives, homemade hot sauces, proper taqueria prices and fresh chips. The negatives are the taco you order on Wednesday may be less delicious on Friday. The delicious well seasoned chorizo at one location may be dry and under-seasoned at the other.  Other than that, the staff at both locations are great, the owner is great and committed and the food is worth it if you are close by and craving mexican food."}
{"text":"We loved the vibe and the carnitas tacos were melt-in-your mouth good. The fish tacos were just okay, but the star of the show might have been the \"plain\" burrito with just chicken, cheese and rice.  Each ingredient was really flavorful and I wanted more. Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not, but I'd definitely stop in if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have been by this place quite a few times going in and out of the Burgh, and finally stopped to check it out. It was busy, which I took to be a good sign. But I was not very impressed. Kind of over priced for what it is. I got a set of 3 street tacos. They area OK. Nothing to write home about.   I supposed I may try it again to see of anything else there moves me, but it is a step above Meh.   There are definitely much better taco joints around the area in this price range."}
{"text":"First time here. 3 stars but has 4 star potential. Service, sort of rushed and hard to believe you can't get melted queso at all.  No forks available? Also the small seating area/counters not cleaned. The special was good and also ordered chips and salsa. Would try again but there is room for improvement."}
{"text":"When it comes to Pittsburgh, one thing we haven't really been able to perfect is the Tex Mex/Mex/South of the Border/Whatever you want to call it experience. I don't mean to knock Mad Mex, Emiliano's, Veracruz (RIP), Mi Ranchito, etc., etc.--sure, Las Palmas has a solid taco stand, and sure, Bea's in the South Side provides a nice experience, but something has always been missing...until now.  El Burro caters to that deep longing that every burrito lover has yet doesn't know exists. El Burro makes Qdoba laughable, puts Chipotle to shame, and hits you smack in the face with what a real burrito should taste like. The guy who runs the place makes his own hot sauces, which are pretty dope. If you need hotter, he buys some pretty good hot sauces you can use, too. The carne asada French fries come loaded with everything you didn't know you wanted on French fries, and the chips are fresh and delicious.  Now, it isn't the Mission or anything, but it's damn reminiscent. And if you don't want a pop with corn syrup, they also sell Mexican Coke (made with cane sugar for that real, rot-your-teeth-in-the-best-ways adventure)."}
{"text":"Tasty tacos and rice and beans. Fantastic customer service. Love the tables outside so I can munch and people watch."}
{"text":"This place is simply great, traditional, Mexican street food. Super comforting and a great place for a quick bite. We ordered the fish tacos and the chorizo taco and were blown away by the freshness and tastiness of these dishes. It was truly a dinner that make you happy. Prices were decent and the atmosphere was great. The cashier was very friendly and helpful as well!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, got two soft shredded chicken tacos that were awesome.  Came back today...totally different.  Got a carnitas burrito that was definitely subpar. It was--literally--80% rice and very little meat. Totally dry, hardly any pico, and the little meat that was there was not carnitas.  Also had rolled tacos...which are actually taquitos.  Fried to the point of very, very well done. Did not come with the avocado that was advertised.   The regular $3 tacos are solid, but the other stuff is overpriced and barely mediocre. $25 for two meals, thought we might get chips or salsa as well, but nothin. Maybe kitchen was having an off night?   So disappointed...was looking forward to some quality mexicali street food"}
{"text":"Had the California Burrito and found it to be a tasty, salty, and fry-filled fiesta! Loved the shop and the location is right near Allegheny Hospital, which is great for me. Great service and nice staff. Excited to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I was excited to have a burrito joint in the neighborhood, but El Burro has been pretty disappointing.  They would be a solid three stars if not for being hugely inconsistent and a little overpriced. The counter and kitchen seem overwhelmed, and orders come out wrong or missing toppings. Meats and beans are sometimes good and sometimes completely flavorless.    Their guacamole is good, but the portion for the price is almost insulting--$2 gets you maybe a tablespoon.  In general the price to quality is off--a just passable burrito is usually more than $10 after tax and tip.   On the plus side, they have outdoor seating and no corkage fee.   Sometimes a mediocre burrito is better than no burrito, and they do come out quickly, but in repeat visits I've been disappointed more often than I've been satisfied. Not in a rush to go back."}
{"text":"Today El Burro is getting two stars. I'm convinced that the food taste better after 3pm."}
{"text":"Fantastic neighborhood staple. They rarely do queso (for dip), but when it happens my day improves 100%  The fish tacos, chicken quesadillas, and chips/salsa are great!"}
{"text":"I had to hop on here to save my vegan friends from this spot. I really really really wanted this to pan out because the menu was actually pretty robust for a plant powered person. However, I ordered the chorizo burrito with beans instead of rice and spicy salsa, Jeff ordered the same but with the rice.   $8 - ok, keep that in mind and an up charge for beans instead of rice. Canned, refried beans.   It showed up looking decent enough and fast food-y but maybe it was going to be great - nope.   First bite and I tried to chew but it was like doing the cinnamon challenge - google if you don't know this. It was literally SO dry I couldn't physically swallow it. I had to ask the gal at the counter for something wet to put on it - there's nothing you can do other than put more salsa on it.   So, I emptied the tortilla, mixed up the beans with the chorizo and ate the 1/3 cup of the interior of this blight.   I am a bodybuilder training for a competition and I had to eat something at that point but never ever again will I be going back. Sad to report.   Twice, homeless folks came in to beg as well which is fine but I think that it should be a concerted effort by management to keep their clientele comfortable when possible. I come from a big city and know this is part of a \"rough\" neighbourhood but it was kind of surprising that it seemed like it was commonplace for less fortunate folks to come in as a regular stop to ask people eating for cash.   I feel ripped off. Poor form."}
{"text":"El Burro has good potential, but the combination of poor inventory planning and lack luster service will prevent me from going back anytime soon.    They were out of major menu items at noon and the woman working the dining area could have cared less that there were customers waiting to be address while she screwed around on her phone behind the register.  The food that was available was good though."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday, so stopped in for a couple of Tacos.  Ordered the Carnitas and Chorizo tacos.  The tacos were good, the meat tasty and some fresh cilantro on top.  The price is $3.25 which seems high as compared to Las Palmas or Edgars or Sabroso which all have a taco that is just as good or better."}
{"text":"Surprised the star count isn't higher for this place. Some of the reviews are very meh and that was hardly my experience. I stopped in on the way back home (to Baltimore) after a lovely afternoon at the Carnegie Museum of Art.   I ordered 2 carnitas tacos and carne asada fries. I actually came specifically for the fries. I'm a California girl and Cali-mex is hard to come by; carne asada fries are comfort and home. Anyway I got them to-go and then started the 4ish hour trek. I made it about 30 miles before being compelled to pull over and eat the tacos (see terrible photo of tacos in my car). I completely underestimated how long brunch from earlier would hold me over AND my own love for tacos. They were so good! The tortillas held up to the copious amounts of pork and spicy salsa piled inside. the pork was flavorful and tender. I was pleased. I made it home satisfied . . .   For dinner the next day I whipped out the fries, scooped them up on a plate, nuked them low and slow before tossing them into the toaster oven to finish (see ugly delicious photo). Just plain tasty even a day later. The meat was expertly seasoned and I'm happy with the tenderness that they were able to achieve from the seemingly inexpensive cut of beef (super authentic, no one makes good tacos with filet mignon). I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"disclaimer: I'm used to taquerias in the Bay Area in CA  service was great, place was clean and accessible, the burrito was heated on a grill after assembling so the temperature was good. however, that was the least flavorful burrito I've ever had (not the worst, just least exciting WITHOUT being terrible). apparently most of the burritos come with just the protein, rice, and pico. no beans, no option of salsa with spice...  rice, carne asada, and pico de gallo do not a $9 burrito make. I've also just legit never heard of a burrito without beans and they are definitely one of the cheapest things you could offer. I added on guacamole which was scant-wanted to add cheese and or sour cream but I'm not paying $10+ to have a forgettable but improved taqueria experience.  sad about the experience as I live close by, and I'll try it again ordering away from the burrito menu, but I'm hopeful Pittsburgh has better Mexican food to offer!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried the carnitas, chorizo, shrimp, and mahi mahi tacos. I didn't love or hate any of them. I liked the chorizo taco, but it wasn't anything special. We also got guac and chips on the side. Their guac tasted identical to Chipotle's guac, which means it was delicious. We really wondered if it actually was from Chipotle because it tasted way too similar to it. Loved the chips that the guac came with. They provided basically a whole bag of chips and a plastic container of the guac.   Taste | 3.5 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 3 Service | 3 OVERALL | 3.5"}
{"text":"Really good! I'm not sure why y'all have something up in your ass. These burritos were on point. They are comparable to what I had after living in San Diego, CA for 3 years and my 5 visits to Mexico. Make sure you know what Mexican food tastes like before giving out poor reviews. Mad Mex is not a real Mexican food."}
{"text":"I would say this is the only decent burrito place in Pittsburgh (still this So-Cal native is salty about not having consistent access to good Mexican food!) The prices here are also pretty reasonable (about $8 for a burrito, $5 for chips and salsa). The chips, albeit cheap, are extremely oily and don't do much to enhance the burrito experience. I do like their homemade mild salsa, which tastes really fresh and has a great color as well as texture. I wish they could put a bit more salsa in the burritos, however, because they are served a bit on the dry side.  The tortilla has more of a bite to it than most other flour tortillas and I wish they incorporated a bit more moisture when they heat them up. The other complaint is the carne asada burrito I had included a lot of steak pieces that still had tendon in them so that ruined the texture a bit for me.  Overall, this place is deserving of 3-stars for the value and for existing in a Mexican food-barren Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Awesome taquitos. Great salsa. I give it a fifth star for the native San Diego gringo owner and his \"bro\" accent. Wouldn't be surprised if he skateboarded to work on a long board."}
{"text":"If you're a vegan or vegetarian and tired of having a veggie taco as your only option then you should come here.  It's great!  The offered potato tacos and soyrizo was an option for your \"meat\" in either a burrito or taco.    The ambiance is that of a typical taco place.  No frills and hardly any seating.  The food is good and they do deliver if you live around there.    I'm pretty sure this will become my new go-to place if I'm ever in the area and hungry.  I may even make a few trips out here JUST for a taco."}
{"text":"Why is the rice in your $12 chicken burritos crunchy?  Consistently though.  Sometiimes I get lazy and order Postmates for a burrito.  Weak el donkey, weak..."}
{"text":"Pretty standard burrito. Ordered a shredded chicken burrito to-go, and was confused as to what came on it and so I asked and I think it was just the rice and chicken, and so I added salsa verde, lettuce, and tomato. It came out in a reasonable amount of time. Got home and ate it, and it was bland, nothing spectacular. Maybe I should've ordered differently, and maybe I'm too used to Chipotle, but I probably wouldn't order again."}
{"text":"Edit: My husband and I were given a second chance to be wowed by El Burro and we were not disappointed! I got a carne asada burrito and my husband took another crack at the California burrito. I added refried beans and sour cream to a burrito that comes with: carne asada, pico de Gallo, and guacamole.   We were way more satisfied by our experience this time. Our order was correct, all the ingredients were tasting fresh, and the service was prompt. I'm changing my initial star review to reflect what was an off-day and not a general reflection of the restaurant. The only reason I'm not changing to 5 stars is that there are some ingredients I feel should come in a burrito by default: beans, rice, animal protein of choice, salsas. To each their own, but I would rather not have to pay extra for burrito basics. Regardless, our experience with El Burro was changed in a positive way and I can see us coming back when another burrito craving strikes.    El Burro is one of the only local, non-chain, places open later into the evening on Sunday- which is why we chose it.  My husband and I ordered the same thing: California burritos. We asked for one with sour cream and for one with cheese. My husband ordered the queso fundido, which is apparently not on the menu.  It took a half hour, at least, to make two of the same burrito. The food was served hot but I've never been to a taqueria where making two burritos takes thirty minutes. The food itself was the epitome of meh. The burritos were basically a wall of dry carne asada. I've never had a dry burrito before. It's not a pleasant experience. Normally I'd be thrilled at the amount of meat stuffed into my burrito but is it really a blessing if you're literally choking your food down? My burrito didn't have any sour cream on it, although I'm certain we were charged eighty cents for it still. The queso fundido was swimming in oil and somehow managed to be bland even though there was chorizo in it and it was made out of... melted cheese. I have no idea what kind of cheese it was.   We tried three times to call the restaurant for a partial refund and no one picked up the phone so I guess this is a lesson learned and we will absolutely not be returning t"}
{"text":"Their burritos are great.  But they always close early.  They need to update their hours, it's a real bummer."}
{"text":"Usually order delivery from here,  Really good food, reasonably priced, great portions, and fast delivery.  Food is all made in house including the tortilla chips! Hits the spot whenever I crave tacos, or nachos, or salsa, or refried beans... lol."}
{"text":"So I really really really wanted to love this place. I live in the area and appreciate great Mexican food.    My husband and I went the first time and it was awesome. Chips/salsa the bomb. His carne asada burrito amazing. My potato tacos delicious.   The second time we went my husband ordered the same exact burrito - carne asada. The meat was not the same. It was a ground meat? We asked about it and they said they had recently changed it.   I went back today. For a business lunch order. 6 people. I ordered a little bit of everything, which included two orders of chips and salsa and five orders of guacamole. They did not send the chips/salsa or guac, or plates, silverware, napkins etc. Since the meeting was in the area, I called them and spoke with the manager and I explained that part of my order was missing. He said he'd deliver it within about 1/2 hour.   About an hour and a half later nothing. I called again. The manager asked me if he could just give me a credit. I said no, I prefer the food to be delivered as promised. Then he asked me what time they close. That shouldn't matter considering the food should all have been there 2 hours ago. Then he begrudgingly agreed to deliver it.   I don't know about you, but I understand it was a simple mistake, which would have normally been fine. The problem was the attitude and lack of follow through. Not to mention this was a pretty large-sized order. If this is the service they give to a customer who spends a lot, I can't imagine the service you'd get for 2.   No thank you El Burro. I'll go eat my Mexican food at some of the other great places in the city like La Palapa, Casa Reyna or Las Velas, where they appreciate you."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past 4-5 months and it's one of the better Cali-Mex spots outside of Southern California that I've had. If it's your first time, I recommend the carne asada fries. Parking could be better, but honestly it's not big deal to drop a few quarters to feed a meter.  They also do large orders, which is great for parties. I recently called in for 80 tacos and that fed about 30-35 people. They hooked it up with bags of chips and three big tubs of salsa. It was a big hit and I plan on doing it again.  It's been a little slow my past few visits. Hopefully I was just there on off days and we don't see any change in portion size or food quality."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch after visiting museums nearby.  Burritos are ok but not much flavor.  The burrito wrap maybe the best part of the whole experience."}
{"text":"\"Every bite is an adventure\" my boyfriend exclaimed before taking another bite into his veggie chorizo burrito. We quite liked our dinner at El Burro! Initially I was thrown off to find that this is more of an eatery than a restaurant. You order at the counter, find a seat and then your order is brought to you. There are napkins at a table, and a hot sauce station with plastic ware (be careful, some of those sauces are extremely hot!). I enjoyed the sweet potato cauliflower tacos and potato tacos. Both tacos were wrapped in two deliciously warm and flaky soft tortillas. We also loved the nachos (without meat)! The chips were clearly prepared in house, and topped with received beans, so much cheese, guacamole, and pico de gallo. It was delicious! The table area is a small corridor, and you might get kind of close with anyone sitting next to you. We sat in a covered window booth which is separate from the rest of the cafeteria style seating. Overall, it was great and we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing: best place in the neighborhood with lots of vegetarian and vegan options. I order from there once a week and I would recommend it. Especially the vegan chorizo."}
{"text":"I'm from California, and San Diego-style Mexican food is one of my loves (I stop at Maritza's at least twice each trip for the best carne asada burrito on earth).  This place is about as faithful a reproduction of a hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint in San Diego as you can possibly get this side of the Mississippi.  In a city that is lacking for good Mexican food, this definitely fills at least a part of my constant cravings for the food I grew up with."}
{"text":"Very tasty taco, nice vibe at lunch. Ask for their spicy house hot sauce. Good vegetarian and vegan options"}
{"text":"I want to eat El Burro's chile relleno burrito everyday! So tasty, and it's already all chopped up in there, so you don't need a knife and fork like with most chile relleno dishes. Great guac, too."}
{"text":"Another excellent choice for Mexican. I've said it before and I'll say it again, but I think I could eat Mexican every day without getting tired of it... and I actually have had weeks that came pretty close to that being a reality. Oops.  I will admit that I am a newbie when it comes to the North Side. I am rarely there, with exception to a few visits to 21+ events at the Children's Museum, and visits to the Mattress Factory and the Aviary. I know very little about the food scene. My friend recommended that we try this place before going to look at cats at the Humane Society. Burritos AND cats all in one afternoon--this was a great day!  I had the chorizo burrito which included rice and pico, and I added sour cream. I also had the spicy salsa on the side. The burrito was huge! I was starving and did manage to finish it, but on a normal day I would definitely have had leftovers. The chorizo was spicy and packed with flavor. Everything tasted very fresh, even down to the sour cream. The salsa was very spicy (which I love), so I would recommend pico or the medium salsa if you're not a huge fan of spice.  The space is small but bright and clean. I'm excited to make a return trip to try some tacos!"}
{"text":"I was fooled by the burrito menu. When I ordered the Carne Asada burrito, the menu showed it had guacamole in it. It did not indicate that's all it would have in it. The beef chunks were cold, hard, and incredibly salty and it was basically like eating beef jerky in a sea of guacamole. The guacamole was full of onions and green bell peppers(?!) I couldn't finish it.   The salsa was good but all I had to put it on was the burrito. It didn't help the burrito at all.  I was disappointed. I had high hopes for this place given that I really enjoy the food at Round Corner Cantina and Mr. J's first visit here was followed by rave reviews. He was disappointed during this trip, as well.  Make sure you ask questions about the menu, otherwise you may get zinged as I did!"}
{"text":"Great north side stop after day exploring the Mexican war streets.  Chips and guacamole were fabulous.  Mahi Mahi tacos were perfect -- deep fried fillets on top of raw cabbage and onions, with a really nice sauce. Carne asada taco was spicy and we closed out with a nice pork taco.  Absolutely fantastic and authentic.  New fav in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Do you have a good taco in your life? If the answer is no, you should really find one. They're great to have around. Tasty, savory, delicious tacos. YUM....  And I have so many different tacos in my life. I don't care about the argument of what is authentic or not. Maybe it's that I've lived in Western PA my whole life, but you know what? I'm okay with that. Because my taste buds dance when they hit my lips!  So El Burro. My latest love affair! It's easy to love considering I love their sister restaurant, Cantina in Lawrenceville. But something is different. Maybe it's that I can actually see my taco (considering it's so freakin' dark in Cantina!). Maybe it's that they seem a little bigger. Or a little more thought thrown into them. I don't know... but they may have been even better!  I ordered the shrimp tacos in a pair for $8 and they were just fresh and grilled perfectly. With incredible corn tortillas. Drool. Best decision I made (along with my taco choice) was getting the chips, salsa and gauc. Oh man. It's a huge portion! I took everything home and ate it again the next day! Happy Birthday to me (note, it's not actually my birthday, but it felt that good!)."}
{"text":"Little place I stumbled across while in the area. I ordered a shredded beef taco and a shredded chicken taco. Both were good, but a little spicier than I was expecting. About 7 bucks for a pretty filling lunch. Things could have used a touch more salt, but I would definitely return here again. As a warning, this isn't really a sit down place as most of the seating was at a bar. Be prepared to take out or wait."}
{"text":"Epic. Amazing price, employee was super helpful with questions and the food (even forty-five minutes later when we ate it) was delicious! We both got carnitas, I the plain burrito and my husband the California. They have a sweet and spicy kick to them! So yummy! And the tortillas were warm and gooey... and overstuffed! Will definitely be back for more. Thanks!"}
{"text":"NOT OPEN. CALL FIRST OR JUST GO SOMEWHERE THAT IS OPEN.  Hey, owners of this place: UPDATE YOUR INFO TO SAY THAT YOU'RE OPEN WHEN YOU WANT TO BE OPEN! It's completely misleading for people who would like to give you business when you aren't even open when you say you are.  Awful. Not a fan. Be serious about your business."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican cuisine. I had the carne Asana burrito. Delicious! The chips are homemade as well as the salsa. I ordered the hot sauce as well, and oh man, it is hot!  The atmosphere is extremely casual. The only seating is counter style seating. Would be an awesome choice for takeout! All in all, great food and friendly service. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"I got two words. \"Tijuana. Hotdog.\" It is a delightful, gravity defying, awe inspiring, bacon wrapped pork stick, deep fried, and lovingly dressed with diced tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos.  I shared one with my wife, thinking that it would be too heavy and greasy to have along with my meal.   I deeply regret offering to do so.    It was so good I wanted it all to myself!  I expected to fall into a deep coma after eating it, but I felt energetic and lively.  Could it have been the bacon induced hypertension kicking it?  Quite possibly, but it tasted much lighter and less greasy than I would have expected.  I also enjoyed a shrimp diablo burrito and my wife got fish tacos which were all excellent.  Normally  I associate Sriracha with asian food.  My shrimp weren't as spicy as their name would suggest, so I gave their Sriracha a try and it complemented the Mexican food perfectly.  They also have house made sauces which were good, but get a few as the containers are small.  It's a bit of a hole, light on atmosphere, but generous with great freshly made, inventive Mexican food, low prices, friendly knowledgeable staff, and every reason to come again soon.  Only a donkey would not love El Burro!"}
{"text":"Emerging among the higher end restaurants in the neighborhood, this new taco joint is exactly what Regent Square needed - great food at affordable prices with quick made-to-order service. The tacos blend interesting tastes to authentic perfection on your choice of corn (or flour) tortilla. While you will be more than pleased with the variety of Mexican fare, the chorizo and carne asada are my personal faves, with shrimp rounding out the top three. Both the carnitas and the mahi mahi could benefit from more seasoning.  Nonetheless, the carnivore and vegetarian will be all smiles with ample selections for both.  And those fresh salsas and limes to top anything and everything with are priceless. They open at 11 for the Breakfast burrito, but don't you worry about the time...the combo of eggs, cheese, pico, and fries (oh my!) is perfect morning, noon or night. The California burrito is also a real dandy.  I recently had my first Tijuana Street Dog out in Tucson, AZ, so that will be item numero uno on the next visit.  If we can't get a taco truck on every corner, El Burro (Numero Dos) is a stellar start."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing and unexpectedly great. Potato tacos were a delicious vegetarian option! Looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile but wasn't sure what to expect. It's BYOB which is always nice. The inside is very small, dark, with some tables and booths and they have maybe 5 or so tables outside to sit at. I ordered the taco Tuesday special, which was two tacos with rice and beans. It was filling and seemed like fine quality. But it was nothing special and just felt like pretty dry plain tacos. We shared chips and guac which was the beat part of the meal. Maybe if I'm looking for an outdoor seating BYOB place to share an app on a nice day it would be worth hanging out outside at one of their tables. But the atmosphere inside and the level of food probably won't have me rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Eh. It's fine, but I find it's definitely lacking in consistency, and sometimes its even not fresh. I've definitely been given way old guac here, and that's just dumb. Maybe if they had better structure or management it might be better? Idk. And hey, I love taco trucks / windows / stands - the more rough and tumble and authentic, the better -  but I'm also used to them being consistently one way or another. Also, I'm not a fan of food made \"pittsburgh,\" which apparently literally just means you add french fries to something that doesn't need it. Yet, if you ask them for any sort of vegetable they are VEHEMENTLY against that sort of addition. What type of mex-american place doesn't have at least sautéed onions and peppers? Again, this place is fine - especially for the north side - but if I didn't live a few blocks away I would never seek it out. If I'm going to get white people Mexican food I might as well choose Chipotle, where I know the ingredients are responsibly sourced and they have a standard of consistency. Also, it's not cheap. It's not expensive, but the prices are like panera or chipotle or any other chain. Again, eh."}
{"text":"We just moved from Texas and have missed having a great taco shop around every corner... this place exceeded expectations with homemade chips and salsas, and authentic street tacos. We will become regulars whenever we get a little homesick!"}
{"text":"Those carne asada fries gave me a whole new perspective on stuff. I started calling my mom more, taking my dog on long walks. Just really switched up my life for the better. And it was all thanks to that delicious conglomeration of meat, potatoes and fixins."}
{"text":"California Burrito is amazing. In true Pittsburgh fashion, they load it with French fries. The carne asada fries are also amazing! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"El Burro is a nice lunch option in the North Side.  The menu reminded me of some of my favorite Tucson-based, super authentic taco shops.  Nothing fancy, just the real deal on a menu board.  I went with the shredded beef burrito and some medium salsa on the side.    The burritos are huge! It was a brick of Mexican goodness, ready to destroy my hopes and dreams of making through an afternoon of training in Allegheny Center.  The medium salsa had just the right amount of kick to it.  The burrito itself was tasty, but something about it just didn't knock it out of the park for me.  It was definitely a more authentic flavor, but still missing something.  I'd like to go back and give the tacos a try.  Corn tortillas always amp up the authenticity and flavor, and I want to see what this guac is all about."}
