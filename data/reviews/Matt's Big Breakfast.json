{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix. Arrived for a late Thursday morning breakfast (11am) and only had to wait 5-10 minutes. Server was friendly and I had the chorizo scramble special. It was great! Very tasty and flavorful. I am one of the pickiest breakfast eaters (i.e. I don't really consider US Egg & Denny's breakfast places). I expect my eggs and all the ingredients to be fresh, and that was certainly the case at Matt's!! This is one of my two favorite breakfast places in the valley (for different reasons, I consider Matt's and the Orange Table to be complimentary)."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for a convention and looking for a place to have breakfast. I found Mate's on Yelp and gave it a shot.  It was fantastic!   Food was awesome, service great, and ambiance was just what I was looking for.  If anyone is downtown phoenix and looking for a great breakfast go to Matts."}
{"text":"Matt's lives up to its expectations. Simple menu, great tasting food. Definitely busy, with fast, super friendly service. I don't know what else you can ask for. Their thick cut bacon is so tasty and filling I could not finish it. That says a lot lol.  Stop by after your morning stroll, bike, or hike , you won't regret it. Btw, their lemonade is made with honey and it's soooooo good."}
{"text":"We recently visited Matt's for breakfast. We were seated at the counter and the food came out quickly and was fantastic. However, our waitress was less than stellar.  She gave us our food and ignored us the rest of the time.  The thing that really bothered us was that she and another server were talking about their customers.  Basically, right next to where we were sitting.  How unprofessional can you be?  I loved the food ,but I am not sure if I will return based on the behavior of the servers."}
{"text":"I love this breakfast joint. Hands down the best breakfast place in all of Phoenix. I love the waffle, it's just perfect. Egg scrambled are delicious and the sourdough bread is just mouth watering. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves to eat breakfast items. The only drawback is the wait to be seated on weekends but the quick service and delicious food definitely makes up for it."}
{"text":"Very impressed w the food, just know b4 hand the wait was almost and hour long and this was on a Thursday b4 noon. I can see why people will wait. The downfall is that now when I have breakfast, the first thing that I think is \"matts, is the best breakfast place I have ever been too\" :p   Can't wait to be back!  Ps Guy from dives and diners was there! :D"}
{"text":"I don't really know what's up with all the good reviews.  This place was really crowded, so I was expecting some GOOD-ASS FOOD.  But it was just okay.  Everyone of our party of 4 got something different and it just seemed like standard breakfast food.  (I got the Belgian waffle)  Positives:  The inside was cute, we got the weird private front-room next to the fridge, so it was nice and quiet, and the orange juice was good.  Other than that, I don't know why we had to wait so long.  Extremely standard.  Could've gotten this breakfast downstairs at any Hilton Hotel."}
{"text":"You wanna great breakfast? I  mean a GREAT down home breakfast. This place will exceed your expectations. There is not a lot to say other than AWESOME! The lines are LONG. Why? Cuz it's worth it. The plates are filled with top notch food. EVERYTHING is great. Hell even the water is great. This can be like a mini trip to Disneyland on a Saturday or Sunday morning! Just go here and eat! You will thanks me. I reserve my 5 rating for certain dining experiences that usually are very expensive places. So it is tough for me to give Matt's a 5. Otherwise I would. This is one of the top 3 places to have breakfast in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"honestly, I don't think there is anything THaT great about this place. Worlds best waffles? I've made waffles just as good with a waffle maker in a college cafeteria ... they don't do anything special with these waffles either-the only option is to order one plain with a side of bacon.... I've ordered breakfast dishes here before and I'm pretty sure they make it taste good by using a lot of butter and salt. There is nothing else unique about how they cook the food... It is very run of the mill. If you are a fan of bacon, it's pretty damn good. The orange juice is Freshly squeezed and SO delicious, and for that I'll give this place 3 stars..."}
{"text":"Waited almost 20 minutes for my breakfast order, which is why I'm giving just 3 stars. But once it came, my food was good. The verde sauce on the huevos rancheros was delicious. I probably won't do the potatoes again because they are heavily seasoned with rosemary which I personally don't care for.  But they were roasted to perfection, with onion. So if you like rosemary, these will make you very happy!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but the service and concept is weird. Wasn't walked to our table to be seated instead we were pointed in a general direction and actually guessed what table to sit at.  Server 1 takes our drink order leaves the table, server 2 come and asks us what we want to drink (less than a minute after the other left), server 3 (again as soon as server 2 left) asks us what we want to drink. I'm still confused. Had to get our coffee replaced 3 times because again no communication that we had decaf (told every server that came though!) Got our food then was given our check right away, felt very rushed out. After all the hype, was super disappointed. Probably wont be returning because the confusion wasnt worth the drive from Gilbert."}
{"text":"Awesome Sun AM breakfast. Prompt service at the counter.  The home fries were fantastic and a huge portion.  The sour dough toast and homemade strawberry preserves were a treat.  Will definitely return next time in PHX for breakfast."}
{"text":"I went to Matt's Big Breakfast for take out because everyone raves about the food.  I could not decide what to order and the waitress suggested I do a la carte, so I went with the griddle cakes and side of bacon.  After a 20-25 minute wait, someone finally asked what I ordered and shortly returned with the food.  I could see that they took food off a plate that had been sitting and placed it in a to go container, not sure where the mix up occurred.  I get back to my office and the griddle cakes were hard and cold.  I could barely finish one of the two that I ordered because they were not edible.  Needless to say it was a very DISAPPOINTING experience and I would be hard pressed to recommend Matt's to others at this point."}
{"text":"I've been to Matt's three time now and the service here is just slow. The food is great when you get it but 15 before anyone even took my order at the bar?!?  I had my water and left.  The bloody Mary's are great and the food is awesome, just make sure you have time and patients."}
{"text":"Food is good.  But extremely slow service.  This is my second time and both times its 15 + minutes for takeout.   Completely unacceptable where people are trying to catch flights."}
{"text":"Very well managed restaurant. The entire wait staff is focused on customer interactions. High quality food at reasonable prices. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I am new to the Phoenix area and was in the mood for someone else to cook my breakfast for a change and stumbled across all these rave reviews of Matt's on yelp. Normally I find that the yelp reviews are just about spot on and very honest. This is my first case of the contrary. I don't know what hole in the wall \"amazing\" breakfast joint these reviews were for, but I must have been at the wrong place.........  Don't get me wrong this place is reasonably priced for your basic breakfast, but that is about it. I gave them an extra star for using \"local\" ingredients. This place is below Waffle House and the like on my list.   The hash browns were more like a chopped potato omelet that needed a few more minuets, I.E. raw mashed potato in the middle. They take \"over easy\" a little too serious also. If there were such a thing as egg tar tar, that's what was on my plate. If you have ever had eggs like this, the ones that can't even be eaten with a fork, then you know my pain. I will say my pork chop was good, but who can screw up a pork chop? The bread was good, nice thick cut slices of what looked to be locally baked loafs. The preserve that came with said toast was okay too, but it got snatched away before I could finish.   All in all, this place is good for the sheep that need to eat downtown, but lacks anything for a reason to return or recommend it to anyone. If you are in the area and thinking of eating here, try somewhere else. I didn't have to wait in line like many on yelp have stated, and I'm sure glad I didn't for that lack of quality. There are many other options in the area, give someone else a shot that's not banking on you eating there because they were on T.V................."}
{"text":"The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that it's a victim of it's own success. My husband and I used to frequent all the time, but now that it's become so popular, we refuse to wait an hour for brunch, even on the weekdays. If you do decide to wait it out, the food is amazing, and the home fries are worth the wait alone. Very friendly wait staff, and cute place, albeit very small.."}
{"text":"such a cute place, and the pancakes are AMAZING. super friendly and fast service, have never been dissapointed by the breakfast here."}
{"text":"If I died and had one last meal, it'd be breakfast from Matt's. I was a regular at Matt's for four years and not enough great things can be said about the owners, the staff, and the food. If you don't have patience issues and can withstand a short 15-30 minute wait, do yourself a favor and stop in for the Hog & Chick and a hot coffee. The hash-browns are some of the best you'll ever have and the bacon is thick-cut, peppery excellence. If you don't enjoy your food or your experience, send me a message and I'll reimburse you. I'm not kidding."}
{"text":"I used  the yelp  app  to  find  this place  and the  reviews  were  right  on  the  money. Service  was  fast  and friendly. I ordered  a special  for  the  day  3 egg with  home  fries  a little  over  priced  but  delicious , tasted like  home  cooking. The  stone  wheat  toast  with  what  tasted  like  home  made  jam  complimented the  toast  greatly bomb. I will  eat  here  again  and  recommend this place  to  friends  and fellow  yelper's"}
{"text":"Wasn't busy at all, lunch rush was over. Had the the French toast special of the day. Tasted good but not spectacular and my side of hash browns were really oily.  I thought my waiter would be more interactive, for example asking me if I had ever been to matts big breakfast or thanks for coming. I also wish they had a changing table in men's restroom for my 1 yr old son. But I'll be back again in the future and try something else."}
{"text":"The one star review is because having to wait in the heat totally ruined the whole meal. Seeing there were over 600 yelp reviews, I was expecting to wait. However, if you are successful enough to have a long wait for your restaurant, you should provide something to keep the waiting customers cool. Misters maybe? Maybe expand to have a foyer?   We waited in the 100+ heat for 40+ minutes. They have a list outside you write your name on so no one is there to tell you how long your wait will be. They provide minimal seating and no misters. There's some ice water with oranges to drink with tiny dixie cups (the kind the dentist provides to swish with). By the time we had our pre-order (where they take your order 10 minutes before they seat you so you don't take up a table too long), I wasn't very hungry and definitely didn't want hot eggs.  After finally getting seated, we immediately have hot plates set down in front of us.   I ordered the BLT (again, I did NOT want eggs when I was so hot!) and it just wasn't that good. Way too much crusty bread that scratched the roof of my mouth. The three people I was with ordered scrambles and said they were nothing they couldn't get elsewhere. The bacon and the waffles were very good.   The wait staff was very friendly and apologetic but it's not their fault and there's nothing they can say to make up for being terribly uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Really fast and really good food. We waited for like 10 mins and got our food in two seconds. Probably because we got the hog and chick and it's requested a lot but whatever the case we got in and out and it was delicious. I recommend sour dough bread with the house made strawberry preserves. AZ so far so good! Ps best earl grey tea I ever had in life..."}
{"text":"I was waiting for a friend to be picked up at the hospital and found this place based off their Yelp ratings. Needless to say the food was awesome but came in very generous portions as well. Service was great and it had that feel of a good old fashion breakfast diner. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Why oh why must you be so tiny and have such good food, Matt's? It's some of the best breakfast I've ever had but it's still not worth waiting an hour. One time I woke up randomly at 6:30 on Sunday and went over there just in time not to wait for a ridiculous amount of time. That was nice. It almost motivates me to wake up early more often. Everything I've tried I've loved, including the waffle, pancakes, omelets and hashbrowns."}
{"text":"Love the French toast.  It was busy, but we were seated right away and got our food quickly.  I would go back"}
{"text":"So....finally went.....and am graciously giving one more star. But that's about it.  Of COURSE triple D keeps finding places in Arizona to broadcast shows from. Is this a big news flash or something? We should be the \"Wide Load\" state. Guy F happens to be a lard, so of course he's gonna B-line towards this shrinky-dinked, over-hyped and over-booked lil' nook that serves portions which could very well springboard the next season of \"1000 Pound Dad\".  The whole \"Reality Food Show Swoops In And Makes Dining Hotspot Out Of Otherwise Run Of The Mill Establishment\" is getting really, REALLY old, Phoenix! Get off your arses and find some places on your own instead of waiting for Food Network to whip you into a manufactured frenzy.  I don't see the point of going, WAITING (and yes - it's true - they don't give wait times {get OVER yourselves}), and then being squished in seats and then paying for portions you can't possibly finish. How about more varied ingredients rather than a hunger-relief-in-Africa portion of potatoes on my plate?  NOW I know why some Scottdalers adore and coddle this place:  It makes 'em feel adventurous. What's more edgy than coming to the semi-impoverished Roosevelt district, parking by a seedy motel (where \"those\" people live), gorging on local bacon and UFO size pancakes, and then safely returning home to the trials of spending the afternoon at Williams-Sonoma? Please.  The flavors are good, but not unique for breakfast. Pancakes were fluffy, but not better than my Pop's. It seems the hype is in the portions, the TV exposure, and the limited seating. People see a line and wanna go wait in it, for some reason. The food is so plain and the menu so basic that it behooves me to come to this conclusion: there's nothing new here, folks. It's breakfast. It's huge. And I couldn't care less."}
{"text":"This place is hip and serves large portions of fresh organic food. The service is speedy and the servers are sweet.   All the food we ordered was on point. Can't go wrong with the Home fries, but these are extra tasty. I got the breakfast sandwich. The bread was great. My dad got the eggs Benedict. It was a lot of food and he couldn't finish it and he always finishes breakfast.   I watched at least 4 people take selfies in here in a span of 45 minutes."}
{"text":"As a downtown local, I've been going for a Big Breakfast since Matt's opened. It got a little ridiculous once the trend-seekers discovered his former spot, and the new location just barely lessens the crowding/waiting problem. I no longer take the chance of going to Matt's and having to wait, but still take out-of-town visitors here for the best breakfast in town. Vovomeena is now my preferred go-to breakfast spot. I can walk there from my home, and it is almost as good"}
{"text":"Seriously? Matt's big breakfast has been open for how many years and yet they still treat their customers like absolute trash.   For whatever reason the manager came over to check out my pick up order. So he walks over, looks me up and down, and gives me a very judgemental look. Then as I was paying he would not look me in the eye and used a very disgruntled tone. Did my business annoy you somehow? I literally was in the actual restaurant for 2 minutes and yet I walked away this bad.   Shame on Matt's. They are better than this. I will never be back. The food is overrated and the service is literally worse than what I would expect from a McDonald's."}
{"text":"Really, Guy?  So I guess if it's featured by Fieri you have to go, and you have to love it, right?  This is coming from the guy who plans cross-country road trips to get my lips on some of the food I see Triple-D.  Sorry Matt's, you kind of fell short on this one.  The wait was way too long for breakfast, although I guess the place is famous now so it's to be expected.    Inside, there were definitely more staff than diners, yet we seemed to be invisible.  We waited forever to get menus, drink and food orders, etc.  The staff were friendly enough and apologized once realizing how long we waited, but come on - it's breakfast, and there are all of what, 5 tables in the whole place?  The food was fantastic, no way to argue that.  Just a little over-priced for the experience that we didn't end up getting.    Would I go back again?  Yeah, if someone came cross-country on a Fieri food frenzy and demanded it.  Otherwise, I would stick to a little more down-to-earth kind of place, which I bet this once was."}
{"text":"One of my best friends brought me here one morning and I had the Monday special which was huevos rancheros. It was simplicity delicious! Solid flavours and great coffee to go along with, I've been here on a few other occasions and I now favor the egg omelette and fresh brewed tea, it is a must have. Just make sure to arrive early as space can sometimes be limited especially on the weekend."}
{"text":"I'd have to say it was a decent breakfast... nothing more, nothing less.  I had a cheddar cheese and ham omelet with hashbrowns, sourdough toast and mediocre coffee.  The hashbrowns were on the greasy side, but that didn't bother me; it's just that nothing blew me away either.  The service was a bit slow considering we got there at about 6:50 a.m. and there were open tables; so I can only imagine how it would be at any other time of the day."}
{"text":"Are the hash browns supposed to be almost raw in the middle and taste kind of fishy?  Everything else was okay but those hash browns needed some serious help.  I think this movie on tv right now called \"Big Miracle\" is better."}
{"text":"This place deserves a 4.5 star rating.  The half point deduction comes from the limited parking and the really, really long wait if you don't arrive early. We went on a weekend. If it is your first time, maybe decide to go on a weekday instead.   I have the say the hour wait was worth it! They have great daily specials chalked on their blackboard in the back and good coffee. I understand where the BIG part comes in when you see the dishes. I ordered a waffle with a side of bacon and hash browns. Hash brown was delicious.  The bacon is the good kind! They were thick, succulent slices, not overly thin and burnt to a crisp stuff. By sampling a bit from everyone else's plate, I got to say everything was top notch.  Hopefully, I will return for a second  helping!"}
{"text":"I must say that this place was pretty darned good. They open at 6:30 AM on Sunday and there was already a line. The whole place was full upon the doors opening, great sign. They have a very small menu but it certainly covers all of your breakfast needs.  I opted for three sides, a pancake, rosemary homestyle potatoes and rye toast with jam. I asked my waitress which to order, the hashbrowns or the homestyle potatoes and she steered me towards my final choice. I'm glad I listened to her as they were delicious, covered with onions, olive oil and rosemary, the were cooked perfectly. They were some of the freshest potatoes I've had for breakfast in a long time. They weren't greasy at all. I felt like I had just gone to the Farmers' Market, chopped these up and cooked them myself for a Sunday brunch at home.  The pancake was good, nothing outside the ordinary. You can tell by the photo that there wasn't too much love in making it. For some reason the syrup was very good, I'm not quite sure what they used, it was a pancake syrup but obviously not the generic diner variety. The rye and jam were fantastic, just look at how thick the slice was cut, I've never seen a rye like that. I wish other places would serve their breads like this. I'd be a huge fan of any place that cut their slices in this manner.  I would certainly go out of my way to eat here again. The staff were terrific, the place was spotless, the owner walked around and spoke with all diners (it seemed like everyone was a local) and the food was great. The prices have risen, at least since their website has been in place but it's still a good deal (the $5 Spot is now $5.75). A great place to grab a Big Breakfast in a nice atmosphere.  I have photos and a more in depth review on my personal blog."}
{"text":"Wife took me here on a day off. Knowing I love breakfast I had to try this place out. The first challenge was finding a parking spot. We eventually found a spot & just by looking at the line outside, we feed the meter for two hours of parking. We weren't aware of signing in on a list until a waitress came outside shouting names. I was eventually told you have to sign up on the list inside. After waiting for 45 minutes we were seated at the breakfast bar and the waitress took our order right away. We both ordered the hog and chick plate. We asked if it was possible to order a single griddlecake on the side knowing it wasn't on the extras menu. She was able to accommodate our request. I also ordered a coffee and orange juice. Coffee to me was coffee but the freshly squeezed OJ had my taste buds ready for the rest of the meal. Seriously refreshing. The bacon, eggs, sourdough toast & fruit preserves were on point. Tasty, tasty, tasty. Wife & I honestly didn't care to much for the rosemary home fries...way too much rosemary seasoning & garnish for us. Next we decided to bite into the griddlecake & again our taste buds were in heaven. Soft and moist like a baked cake in the form of a pancake...the best we've ever had. This place is going to be my go to breakfast joint on another day off no doubt. The wait time was definitely worth it. Thanks to the staff for their prompt & friendly service. We'll be returning whenever I have business to do in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food and a lot of it.  When ever my son comes to town this is his first choice.  Every thing is fresh and the service is great.  Pick this for a best breakfast location !"}
{"text":"The waffle is the best! The bacon is thick cut! A must come to when visiting phoenix. There was 20 min wait though"}
{"text":"I was excited to discover that Matt's Big Breakfast had opened at Sky Harbor but it was quite possibly the worst dining experience I've had at an airport in quite some time.  I waited for nearly 15 minutes for a bowl of oatmeal and a coffee. After asking several times when my breakfast would be ready, and being told \"Just a couple more minutes,\" I realized that I was going to leave the restaurant without my breakfast.  I requested a refund, however, the manager couldn't figure out how to work the register to handle my refund so I left without my receiving my breakfast or refund.  The manager kept suggesting that I be patient while waiting for my breakfast and again when I requested my refund.  Unfortunately I had a plane to catch and didn't have the luxury of waiting over 15 minutes for breakfast or to get my money back.    In case they haven't realized it yet - The airport is not the place to ask patrons to be patient!  Don't waste your time or money at this establishment."}
{"text":"A lot of friends have been recommending this place so i finally got to check it out. The menu chatted my by its simplicity. Bring a big breakfast fan myself i don't really need a lot of options,  Just good options and they deliver.   The hash browns were ridiculously awesome. The rosemarry potatos were magical. Get the chicken apple sausage though. I cant live without that now.   The atmosphere was my favorite part. The tables, chairs, decorations were all cozy and its clear they took great effort to make the place cool af.   The wait was crazy, but i was expecting that i guess.   The staff was cool and chill. There is a small parking lot and a handful of metered spots. Parking is probably the only thing that will make it hard to get back to Matt's. It was a nightmare."}
{"text":"I waited over 30 minutes for my breakfast which is inexcusable for eggs and bacon in general but multiplied in an airport setting. And it's not enough for the host to tell you food will take 20 min. Again it's an airport!!!!  I will stick to Matts on Camelback and explore other options in the airport."}
{"text":"Ive been going to Matt's for a couple years now and I have always loved the place. I go for the food because it's the best breakfast in phoenix, but even more for the awesome staff. The owner, who everyone calls Mama- which I think is so adorable- is one of the most welcoming and hospitable people i have ever seen in the restaurant business. Everyone seems like they love working there and they have so much fun together.  I went this past sunday (11/18) and had a great experience with my husband. He had the steak and it was AMAZING and I had their scramble special which is always a winner. homefries with onions and fresh rosemary are so stinking good. My waitress was a super sweet red head and was so attentive. She checked on us just the right amount of times and went above and beyond to make our experience pleasant. I dont know what these people are complaining about, I've always had great service when we go on the weekends- maybe we will check it out on a weekday and see if its different.  I was so impressed by all their local use of product and I think its awesome that they get the best ingredients they can. I didn't know how many local business they work with until I asked our waitress and she told us all the different places we were asking about.   Will continue to go to Matts every weekend. Keep up the great work everyone!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand what the hype is all about. The wait is always long, the service is slow. The bacon tastes good but is severely undercooked. The waffles taste like cardboard. The prices on the website don't match in store menu prices."}
{"text":"Great portion size- Lunch and dinner for 7.95 :)  I definitely recommend Matt's. There was a wait, but it wasn't terrible- just bring a book or play 20 questions. The bacon was delicious. I had a BLT and my boyfriend had the egg sandwich. Both were great, but the egg sandwich was AWESOME. I would get that if I went again.   Worth checking out, fast service once you're seated, $20 for two of us and we both had leftovers."}
{"text":"We lucked out with no wait by going at 8am. Cool vibe of the place but the meal I chose (griddle cakes) wasn't anything special. Parking is a bit of a pain - there's a tiny one-way lot if you're lucky; otherwise street or church parking. Great service but probably wouldn't make the effort to come back."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is amazing! They had very good service, everyone was very nice and quick. The only thing that was slightly annoying about it was they didn't let us do separate checks! Other than that it is a great brunch place!"}
{"text":"Tues morning 6am ,we stood at the hostess table ,  older gentleman behind the bars looked up at us ,looked around then went back to counting money never once saying hello welcome or kiss my ass. We waited at the hostess station for a few minutes before being seated. Ordered our food and our severs was without any personality. Took our order and a guy in the kitchen screamed are order to the cooks. Our food was served up quickly. I ordered a egg sandwich with bacon and potatoes, on a scale of one to ten , with ten being the best , the sandwich was a 2 , it was hot and fresh but void of favors ! Server never checked on us. The place was clean and bright .  It's better then the Wendy's but not by much."}
{"text":"We try to come to Spring training every year for 2-3 days, we stop at MBB every morning we are here. Great breakfast, great people. See you again soon!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for so long we had to try it! We got here at 10:30 and waited about 15 minutes, which is not too bad... maybe because it was a weekday? I have practically heard war stories about waiting in this line, so I was pleased.   I had the griddlecakes and they were huge (like, grab a friend to help) and tasty. Real maple syrup, too! Yum! My man-panion had the Big 5 sandwich. The onions gave it a fab flavor. It was an interesting mix of soft bun, crispy onion, salty bacon and eggs.  Our other brunch guest had the special of scrambled eggs, sausage, cheese and peppers. Wonderful mix of flavors, too!   We thought all tasted wonderful and will make a point to come back!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast. The waffle was probably as good as I've had at a restaurant and the quality of the food was really good. I'd recommend stopping in, but as for now and where my travels have taken me it didn't dethrone Ruth's Diner in Salt Lake as my favorite breakfast."}
{"text":"Matt's is always really good. You won't be disappointed with anything you order. The quality of ingredients is above that of most places and the service is very attentive. If you're a fan of a really good breakfast, Matt's is one of he best in the country."}
{"text":"Best...hashed...browns...ever.  (and yes, it's hashED browns, folks.)  I have tried a new brunch place almost on a weekly basis since I moved here in August, and MBB wins the hashed browns contest hands down.  They're so perfectly and proportionately crispy and soft.  DELISH!  Do try!    I ordered the hog and chick kind of out of necessity since there wasn't a great variety of choices on the menu, but in the end, it didn't matter cuz it was delicious.  I think the thing about MBB is that everything on the small menu is probably awesome, which is why they can afford to keep the menu small.  A nice touch was that they carried the Sunday newspaper, which was perfect since we forgot ours that particular weekend, and that helped to pass the waiting time for our food (which was not bad at all.  maybe 15 minutes.).    For all you coffee lovers, the java here is pretty good as well.  In fact, the waitress told us that the owners of MBB just recently opened up a coffee shop somewhere locally, so I'll have to find out where and go.  I just hope I don't have to wait as long as I did to get into MBB to get some coffee.  Truthfully, it wasn't so bad waiting.  I think we only waited about a half hour.  The only downside to MBB is the small space!  You'd think they would want to expand a little, but mayhaps this is part of the allure for us MBB fans.  No pain, no gain.   Sidenote: Parking is not the BEST, but if you go early, you should be able to find a spot just fine.  ALSO, note that they do NOT split checks.  Good to know beforehand."}
{"text":"I'm sorry guys, not sure what all the fuss is about.  We came here because of the reviews, but I would say my experience was middle of the road.  I had the cheese omelette with peppers and onions($2 extra charge).  First off the cheese wasn't anything special for an aged Wisconsin cheddar, and the pricy peppers and onions? Well they were barely cooked with no seasoning at all added, but the worst part was the hash browns, Totally Inedible!! They were greasy, unseasoned and undercooked( translucent through 80%).  My husband had the waffle which was better than most, but nothing outstanding.  I was happy that they helped us out with the bill after I complained about the hash browns, but the manager was not the nicest about it. Made it seem that not  liking greasy, uncooked hash browns is a matter of taste- like it was unreasonable that I hadn't eaten them, and complained!?  Not sure I will bother coming back, there are plenty of trendy diners out there that will treat me better, it's too bad because I had high hopes, and liked their atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the service was terrible.  1. There was hair in one of our waffle plates.  2. The servers were not very attentive.  3. When we had a mistake on an order, the waitress rudely confronted us instead of being accommodating.  4. I had to wait over 5 minutes (after the rest of my party had walked out) just for them to notice I was waiting for the check. And last when I paid the bill they did not bother to ask how everything was. Poor service ruins even a great meal and I will NEVER return and let my friends know to not bother going there."}
{"text":"The service and food here is great. Daniel and other staff members great me with a smile and prompt service every time I come in. I'm a creature of habit so I only get the omelette, but damn if it isn't tasty. If you haven't stopped by, seriously what's stopping you? Better food than IHOP or Denny's, that's for sure."}
{"text":"The service and the coffee were absolutely excellent. The preserves and ham were tasty, as well. Their use of local produce and ingredients is a plus. However, the menu is limited and overall, our selections were merely good - not great. Our rosemary potatoes were under cooked and the eggs were far too runny. I would have understood this had it been busy, but it was just after noon and the cook was not overburdened at all. I would go back if the wait is a few minutes, but I would never stand around for a half hour plus for a table."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of amazing. Although very busy, the wait wasn't very long at all and we even got our food in a reasonable amount of time. I got the biscuits and gravy special and it was phenomenal. You could tell that all the ingredients were made from scratch and very fresh. The eggs, potatoes and main course. Everything simply amazing. But what REALLY stood out to me was the strawberry lemonade. Hands down the best glass I've ever had in my LIFE! You could tell even that was made with fresh squeezed lemons and strawberries. It was amazing. This place lived up to its hype and I will DEFINITELY be back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Awesome!   On Saturday, get there as early as possible, put your name down on the list and walk over to the farmer's market for a quick look around and you'll be back in time to get your table... Food's great, service is quick and the prices are reasonable... Love this place!"}
{"text":"Likes.......  Staff & service, fast & friendly!  Simplicity of the entire place, including a  small menu, but it serves it purpose w/o being  overwhelming.  The bacon rocks!!!!   The fresh baked bread & preserves are awesome!  Dislikes.....  My eggs were anything but over medium.  (Super runny)  My home style potatoes were raw. At lest 3/4 of them were not cooked an not edible. :(   My husbands sausage patties were still visibly pink in the middle. (Not anything that's gonna kill ya, but IMO pork sausage should be cooked thoroughly.)  I really think you guys have a great place, I just think  maybe the cooks need to slow down a bit & get the food  cooked properly. Obviously, the place is normally packed w/ people waiting & I am sure that puts a lot  of pressure on everyone. Sometimes you have to take a  step back to take a step forward."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Thanks Alexa! Food was delicious. Loved the handmade sausage patties.and rosemary potatoes."}
{"text":"Really good food, nice atmosphere, and very friendly service!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Matt's and truly love the food.  You can't go wrong with the daily specials.  I'm giving it only 3 stars because of a recent experience that was very disappointing.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy special, which was very good however the biscuit to gravy ratio tipped towards the biscuit.  A little extra gravy was needed to compliment the large biscuit.  When I asked for some extra gravy the server told me it would be an additional cost.  I agreed to the extra charge and totally enjoyed my meal.  When I received my check, I noticed the extra charge for the gravy was $3.95.  Now the entire meal was $10.95.  I was charged almost 40% for a little extra gravy.  When I questioned the tab, I was told that I ordered a side of gravy and that was the cost.  Really good food, but I felt like I got nickel and dime'd for the extra gravy.  There should be a balance to the dish and I had to pay an extra 40% to achieve it."}
{"text":"Never been here and the wait was about 15-20 min. Yet it was worth the wait. The menu was short and simple which I love. Very organized staff and we had a party of 4 yet we were served pretty quick even though they were very busy.  Everything was so good we all cleaned our plates. Our servers were very nice and attentive even on a fast paste environment. Definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. Ordered a waffle to go, was told \"couple of minutes\", ended up waiting for over 20 minutes, and waffle was burnt. Forgot my coffee, too. Never ever will return."}
{"text":"If you don't have to wait to get in it's very good. Nice, medium size menu for breakfast that gets it all done in a great way. Quality all the way around."}
{"text":"Matts is my most favorite breakfast place. With the new Tempe location I'll be visiting more often. Great food, very reasonably priced and very friendly staff. Can't say enough good things about this place"}
{"text":"After seeing this place on the triple D food show, I had to give it a spin. I arrived early and was offered a spot at the counter which was fine with me as I was dining alone and didn't want to take up a full table.  Waiter was the best: friendly, slight flirt, busy but did not forget me, checked back 4 times.  I ordered the Belgian waffle with bacon and a side of eggs. Perfect meal. The waffle was so light and fluffy. The syrup was real maple. Eggs cooked perfect. Bacon well seasoned/peppered/smoked. I could have eaten a full slab of it.   I will be coming back here. You will not be disappointed by the service or the food, they both rocked. Thanks"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this breakfast restaurant... That during my one week vacation, I stop here 3 times!!! Order the hog and chick generously portion eggs, hash browns and oh yeah the XXL bacon which is worth the sometimes long wait, but hey there's water outside to cool you down during the Phoenix dry heat... Staff were also very helpful and with a great attitude at all times"}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome!! The big in Matt's big breakfast is definitely for the size of the food not for the building."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best meatloaf I've ever had, doesn't even need the gravy. Quick service, strong cocktails, nice spot before boarding."}
{"text":"We are breakfast at the airport location.  Great service and quality food.  We ordered The Five Spot and the Hog & Chick.  Bacon was excellent.  Just simple great quality food with a smile."}
{"text":"I just had one of the best breakfasts of my life here this morning.  Hubby and I arrived around 11:15ish and was promptly greeted by their very friendly hostess.  It was packed and we had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated but it was so worth the wait.  I am happy to report that we both loved every morsel.  Their peppered bacon and rosemary home fries have changed my life!  Both perfectly prepared with super deelish eggs over easy.  I saved the best part for last - their amazing homemade rye toast and strawberry jelly with real butter soaked into its yeasty goodness!  OMG I almost moaned out loud while eating it.  Hubby loved his ham and cheese omelette too!   What was even better than their amazing food was their friendly stellar service.  EVERYONE we came on contact with there were so friendly and nice.  We are only here for the weekend and only planned on stopping by here today - we will definitely be back on our way home on Sunday morning!  Thank you Matt's crew for an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Was in town for GC. Stopped by on the way back to LA. And this was a good spot to find in downtown PhX. The coffee was great. It had no bitterness at all even drinking it black. The food was good, the thick pepper Bacon was all it's cracked up to be. Had the chop and chick and it hit the spot. The preserves are good and not too sweet. Would definitely come back if I am in town. :)"}
{"text":"I read many of the reviews and couldn't pass up a breakfast here. We had the waffles and the Wednesday special, which was French toast. The French toast was just average. My daughter says the waffle is the fluffiest and best waffle she's ever had. We did not have to wait for a table at all (a Wednesday at 9:30) so that was nice. Parking was also easier than expected: plenty of street parking and a parking lot nearby. Service was ok. Waitress was prompt with order taking and very pleasant but once our order came, we were forgotten.  No water refill until we flagged someone over to ask."}
{"text":"Let me just say how happy I am to have finally eaten here. My goodness. Went one Saturday morning before the farmers market. It was early so the wait wasn't bad at all.  Got the breakfast sandwich and side of hash. If two people want the breakfast sandwich you could easily share. Not that it's huge but it was definitely filling. All three of us only are half...those grilled onions really turn the 'wich into something special. The bread was so soft and tasty. Yum.  Also got the honey strawberry lemonade...I need an IV of that into my body.  I will note that our waitress was oddly touchy...which was strange but not a big deal.  Anyways now that I am five minutes down the street I will gladly come back."}
{"text":"Whether you treat breakfast like dessert or like bbq, this is the place to start your day.  I recommend the ridiculous waffle or the salami scramble. What I am talking about... order both, you deserve it!"}
{"text":"They have a new location just up the street from the old one and this one has BATHROOMS - YEAH!! Food here is AS GOOD AS IT GETS, you can't find better food in this town AT ANY PRICE.  We are huge fans, love that BIG BUTTER BURGER and the GRIDDLE CAKES.  We drive 100 miles round trip to get this food and it's WORTH it. Congrats, Erenia and Matt - LOVE the new place!"}
{"text":"Matt's has a thoroughly Wonderful Waffle that's flavorful exactly like home cooking ought to be. We loved the Heuvos Rancheros, too - a Special on Mondays."}
{"text":"Great service and food. My favorite is the waffle that came with a side of thick cut bacon. Would definitely recommend to anyone that would like to have great breakfast food."}
{"text":"Ordered the famous \"Butter Burger\" medium rare. Forget lettuce, tomato, and pickle, eat this with cheese and maybe some ketchup to let that beef shine through. Delicious! Great diner atmosphere, got to sit at the counter.  Happy to see it was Niman Ranch beef, a sustainable/organic livestock provider."}
{"text":"This is the biggest joke on the internet. The people (staff) are the rudest in the state, PERIOD! The food is standard fare, nothing special. Like all restaurants in Phoenix, they (owners) all visit each other and write great reviews for each other."}
{"text":"hmm...Well, I loved the breakfast at this adorable little joint.  Unfortunately, I am not a fan of waiting an hour and a half outside in the heat.  I also do wish they had a larger menu, but oh well.  thats what makes this place, right?  anyway, I will definitely come back again, but not if i am stuck waiting outside in the heat.  ...but i should probably get to the point.  I had the breakfast sandwhich (sorry I cant remeber its name :(  ) and my friend had just a regular belgian waffle.  both were delicious.  OH YEAH!!  and they offer fresh squeezed OJ.  that was one of my favorite parts.  When we were all said and done, we left with a $30 bill including tip."}
{"text":"is it just me or has the selection been reduced since they moved to the new larger location?  I took some out of town guest to Matt's - Saturday 8am - line was short.  there was about 8 breakfast selections - yawn.  the food is good - but no longer excellent.  there are many better locations and the service was lacking. I had to ask 5 times for a cup of coffee - finally took my cup to the counter for a refill with my food  Average at best. It used to be well worth the drive to matt's from No. Scottsdale. Now, I would save the gas and each local"}
{"text":"It had been a very long time since I had been to Matt's Big Breakfast. It had been since the other building, when to use the bathroom you went in a room in the motel next door (very creepy, but hey it added character). While I do appreciate a more normal bathroom situation there is just something about the new location that leaves me missing the old. That is why I only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, maybe I'm too nostalgic. I can saw however, the wait time is greatly reduced by having the additional tables. I do also feel that the service is reduced by the addition of the tables. My husband had ordered the three egg special but it came out 10 minutes before my plate of food. I had ordered the ruben which was also very good but I asked for extra thousand island that never came. My cup sat empty waiting for more iced tea for the greater part of our meal. I will still always love Matt's Big Breakfast but it's just not the same."}
{"text":"Bacon was wayyyy too peppery, they should really just call it pepper bacon. The waffle was bland. However the omelet was perfectly cooked and the ingredients were fresh. The home made butter and the syrup made up for the waffles lack of flavor. Its nice that everything is fresh and natural but when 50% of all the food is some what bland it doesn't really cut it, and the servers were friendly but are a bit out there. Its hard to explain, unique, yet uncomfortable. I saw one waitress get on her knees and put her face right next to a guy ordering as he just stared at her and awkwardly gave his order with the most frightened expression. My dining companions might be back, but I will not be. It just equated into a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in the entire state of Arizona!!"}
{"text":"I don't normally like to share reviews without giving some critique for improvement. So... Matt's Big Breakfast- amazing food, delicious, flavorful. My girlfriend and I went suedo-hungry, the wait as we knew and expected was long and limited with seating, but totally worth it. Blythe time western sat, very hungry. We tore over the menu and order the Five Spot sandwich and the special. Both of us agreed we've never had a more delicious breakfast! Honestly was expecting a little letdown, but didn't. Awesome spot, will recommend to anyone with taste buds and time to relax. No wonder Guy Fieri came here!!!"}
{"text":"Cool place but they put waaaayyyy too much rosemary in the potatoes. I think I had an entire bush!  Not even chopped up just sprigs of rosemary. We asked for more syrup and they told us it would be an extra charge of $1.50!  They only gave us 2 tsp for a stack of pancakes. If you love rosemary and dislike syrup this is a great place!"}
{"text":"I love Matt's. I hate the wait. But if you have the patience, it's worth it. Really yummy hash browns, waffles, and I am never disappointed with their specials. Irenia is super nice and remembers her regulars which makes it feel less like a conveyer belt of customers."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The wait was bearable because of my company. If you have the right mate you can withstand any wait,. The food was outstanding the service was awesome and the coffe is from the C-4 coffee house in cave creek way cool! I will be back soon, Matty!"}
{"text":"Ordered the cheese omelette and added bacon and onions. It came with potatoes and toast. Maybe just my taste buds but despite the reviews I read, the rosemary seasoning is overwhelming and the potatoes seem undercooked. Looking at empty plates as I left, I see lots of uneaten potatoes so I suggest the chef rethink their recipe. Valentin was my server and he was good and the speed of service was good. The toast is about 1/2 inch thick and more like a dessert; again not my cup of tea but whatever. Crossing this place off my airport stops; will stand in line at Wendy's next time. Sorry!!"}
{"text":"We love Matt's Big Breakfast. We have been going there for Sunday morning breakfast off and on for years. We love the waitstaff and the owner. We each get our favorite thing: breakfast sandwich, waffle and bacon and the scramble special. The only downside about the place is that it is busy and there can be a wait... but it is only because the food is great and people feel like it is worth the effort."}
{"text":"It is the usual American Breakfast place. There is nothing novel about any of the dishes. The service was horrible. One of the hosts dragged our table as we were eating without even asking first to make room for another table. That was an absolute low point."}
{"text":"$20 bucks for 2 eggs,toast, milk, sausage and hash browns, really and it wasn't even that good. It's an egg for god sake !!! And she forgot the milk had to asked for it twice."}
{"text":"Wow!!! For Airport food this is way beyond that! Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix. I had the Mamacita Burger, I added an egg just for shits and giggles. Definitely need to check this place its in the U.S. Airways B terminal."}
{"text":"Has Matt's become a victim of its own success?  Food was great as usual and word has definitely gotten out but in opening more restaurants has quality given way to quality?  In terms of service, this morning the answer is yes. We sat for a while before our order was taken after a \"Have you been helped yet?\" (Which is a sure sign of lack of front of house organization).   My food came out with hash browns instead of home fries but since it took so long to get the food after ordering and since we weren't checked on anyways, there was no opportunity to correct the mistake.   The toast with our order came 5 and 8 minutes after our entrees hit the table which is baffling and unexcuseable.   Water and coffee refills were also few and far between and a microcosm of the lack of attention demonstrated today."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great breakfast spot in Phoenix, this is the place to go. The food was fresh and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The menu is small but the options are everything you would want from a breakfast spot. I highly recommend MBB.  Tip: The earlier you go, the less of a wait you have. We got there at 8:30 on a Tuesday, and we're seated right away."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Even when they get your order wrong  [three times over 7 years]; it is still Very Good!!    Hog & Chicks is my favorite!  & Some of the Best Ice Tea in town."}
{"text":"I am in Arizona for business. This place is the bomb.com. I had had the special.. 3 eggs, cheddar cheese, jalapeño and churizo with hash-browns and well done bacon. Also a side of toast With fresh blue berry jam. The tea was non gmo and delicious and the food was fresh. Matts is probably the best meal I will eat in Pheonix. Skip breakfast at the hotel  and go to Matts Big Breakfast!"}
{"text":"Wow, this is absolutely the most average place i've ever eaten breakfast.  Not much different than national chains.  Way overrated.  Do not go out of your way to eat here, you'll do just as well at a large chain."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast I have ever had! I have been here 4 or 5 times, and every meal has been wonderful. The wait is long, depending on the day, and they do not tell you the wait time. It can be up to an hour and a half. If you go on the weekend, get there early! By 9:30 there is a crowd outside. If you are able to go o a weekday, you may be able to be seated immediately. Either way, Matt's Big Breakfast is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Very good food I had the cheese omelet and home fries it was delicious. Servers were quick and very friendly. There was a bit of a wait but it was totally worth it. I will definitely check them out next time I am in Phoenix. If you are in town I'd say these guys are the best bet for some good ol brunch. Tell me Dre sent ya lol."}
{"text":"I fly a lot from the Phoenix airport and always come here for the awesome food. Today I decided to try the chili for the first time. It was cold! I sent it back and it returned lukewarm. I ate it because I was hungry, but was incredibly disappointed."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. I think they could tell I was not a local. They have individual Window bar where I sat. The stools were not fitting my butt. Very slippery.  I was surprised at 10:00 the place was packed.  Staff was very friendly.  I went with the hash browns instead of home fries.  One egg and one griddle cake.   Very good combination.  I really enjoyed the warm syrup."}
{"text":"This was an amazing place with amazing hash browns and an amazing breakfast sandwich called the five spot the only bad thing was that it was too small for how much business they had but all in all it was good"}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere and it seemed like the staff was really friendly.  I ordered the Chick & Chop.  It was eggs your way, choice of home fires or hash browns (I chose fries), and a bone-in pork chop.  The pork chop was a little over cooked but the flavor was delicious.  It was seared nicely, but because it was only 1/8\" thick, it was quickly over done and dry.  Otherwise, I would have given this place 5 stars.  The coffee was excellent, the home made preserves was delicious, and the home fries were savory and perfect.  There was a long line, but since I was alone, I sat immediately at the bar.  The service was fast and friendly.  It was kinda loud, but that was a sign of good food."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town.  Get the salami scramble for a real treat.  Everything is the freshest imaginable.  Even the potatoes are great!   And the bread and home made preserves are heavenly.  Have tried many breakfasts in town, and always come back here.  Worth the prime-time wait of 30-45 minutes."}
{"text":"We spent the night in the terminal between flights and saw Matt's. It looked like a good place for a real breakfast so we were looking forward to it.  The wiat satff was very good. I think our waitress was named Maura or something similar. And the table near us enjoyed a lively, funny chat with their waiter.  The bacon was great -- it seems to be one of their trademarks. My Belgian waffle was good, just what I wanted, but nothing spectacular. My wife had french toast and was disappointed. It seemed like it had just been passed through the egg soaker and wasn't nearly rich or eggy. Tea was hot. Service was quick and attentive. Price was fine."}
{"text":"Went here this morning for breakfast with my Mom and enjoyed every bite. Great atmosphere, staff, and food. My Mom had the slim and I had the BLT. Food was outstanding. Prompt service and attentive staff again. Highly recommend this spot. I had the opportunity to meet the owner and she is now a 2nd mom to me. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Sorry folks I just didn't get what all hub hub is about , it wasn't bad but it was nothing to get excited about. To tell you the Hod's honest truth I have had better breakfast at some local Greek diners and with bigger portions to boot. Maybe I went in with great expectations after reading the reviews and catching the Guy's triple D show, and was expecting manna from the God's. I had to chuckle when our name was called and proceeded to the hostess where we expected to be walked to our table but instead she pointed to a far away table and were told to it there, I guess there's a first time for everything. I would give Matt's a middle of the road review and it's worth a try if your in the area, but I for one would never wait more then 15 minutes to be seated it's just not the old."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Great food and staff. I promise if you try it once you'll be hooked"}
{"text":"I had an excellent meal here.  There were two of us and we arrived at about 7:30am on a Saturday.  We waited only 25 minutes.  We could have been seated at the counter sooner but decided to wait for a table.  The service was EXCELLENT.  For the type of  food you get here it did take longer than expected to be brought to our table though.  My omlette was cooked perfectly, the wheat toast was outstanding.  I was expecting traditional home fries but was surprised when they brought me Yukon Gold potatoes cut up and lightly browned with olive oil and rosemary.  The bacon was also cooked just right.  I also tried a couple of bites of their waffle which was good and I will most likely order that next time.  While it is a small place, you do not feel to cramped inside nor is it too loud to have a conversation across the table.   Portions are a good size and for both of us the bill was $20.00."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing breakfast! The hogs and chick, steel cutt oats, and pancakes are by far my favorites and I get them everytime! If you go you have to get the pancakes!!!!"}
{"text":"Long wait (40 minutes) on a Friday morning. Guess it's due to limited seating capacity. But the Five Spot and home fries were delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food! Long lines but very worth the wait. As seen on TV and not disappointing."}
{"text":"First off , never had a bad meal here. Old or new location.  The new place has the same feel , just bigger and cuter !! Still the same old hassles of downtown parking but that's the norm. We both had eggs Benedict at this visit and it was awesome.  I rarely get to visit Matt's since the wait is so long.  So given the chance to walk right in and sit down on a weekday was such a treat.  The waitress was friendly and bubbly as all of them are.  If you haven't been to the new location , go check it out."}
{"text":"Stopped by Matt's at Sky Harbor waiting for an evening flight.  I ordered the Sonrisa Burrito (no meat) which contains eggs, cheese, potato, & jalapeno.  Who doesn't love breakfast for dinner? :) The waiter asked if I would prefer Avocado in lieu of the meat - so I bit and asked for it on the side.  I also requested extra jalapeno.    For an adult beverage, I ordered a double Tanqueray and soda water with lime.    The drink came out first.  Immediately I could tell two things: it wasn't Tanqueray in my glass, and the drink was definitely not a double (although it was in a tall glass.)  I mentioned the drink to my waiter, and he explained that a double is 2 ounces, not the customary 3.  I requested an additional double (neat) to test my theory.  Sure enough, it was not what I had ordered, it was well gin (brand unknown.)  I wont speculate as to why - draw your own conclusions.  All in, my premium double was $30, and it was not premium or drinkable.    On to the burrito:  in AZ (generally speaking) if you order jalapenos, the unspoken rule is that they will be fresh.  In this case, they were pickled nacho slices and missing all of the fresh jalapeno flavor.  The eggs were burnt to a crisp, and this is coming from a guy who does not specifically enjoy the classic runny yolk or French omelette.  They put the avocado in the burrito instead of on the side.  On top of being extremely overcooked, the eggs and potatoes were completely under-seasoned... no salt or pepper that I could taste.  The side of salsa was mediocre, but edible.    To sum it up: at Sky Harbor, find food and beverage elsewhere.  I left with a $50 tab (I did tip the waiter, as he was courteous and quick.) For $50 bucks, I had a few sips of a beverage I did not order and a few bites of a bad burrito."}
{"text":"The best bartender EVER, ANYWHERE!  We arrived in Phoenix in the morning, but my body thought it was lunchtime.  Matt's was not serving lunch yet, but the bartender said  we were welcome to order burgers from next door and bring them over.  He set us up with place settings and drinks and we were happy campers.  One does not expect customer service like this at an airport restaurant - the bartender (geez, I wish I could remember his name) was exemplary.  It was so much fun to watch him work - providing great service to all and doing so with a smile on his face and a serious spring in his step.  I would eat there again in a heartbeat.  Everyone around us was happy with their food, and I must add that the bacon bloody mary looked beyond amazing.  I will have one the next time... for sure."}
{"text":"Good food and nice staff. Must visit. Not a huge menu, but a good mix of all types of popular breakfast choices. Parking lot is a bit tricky. Coffee is excellent!"}
{"text":"I expected the typical airport burrito - big price, small portion. I was glad to be wrong. While the first half was mostly potato, the second half made up for it with egg, cheese, and sausage. Only regret- not getting the salsa."}
{"text":"The pancakes were fluffy and sweet. The real butter and maple syrup were the perfect topping for them. The service is fast and efficient.  The waffles and bacon were a hit with my friends.  I definitely recommend trying it out if you are in the neighborhood. I'm not sure I would recommend driving out of your way to get there unless you are a true foodie."}
{"text":"The wait staff is right on point, pleasant and attentive. The food was great. The special was a little pricey but definitely filling and tasty."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Anytime my husband and I talk about going to breakfast Matt's comes to mind.  The food as always been on spot... very fresh, cooked perfectly and very tasty! The orange juice is freshly squeezed and they always have homemade jam and one different flavor for the day, the blueberry is outstanding! The pancakes are the best I have ever had in my life, fluffy and melt in your mouth! The portions are big, so be ready to eat.  The price's are a bit higher than most, but your getting local, organic ingredients that are cooked to perfection!!  The service is great and the staff is very friendly.  I would have to say, the only downfall to Matt's is the location, it is pretty small (but bigger than the last location they had) and the parking is extremely minimal! There have been a few times the wait is pretty long, but WELL WORTH IT!!  They do have a lunch menu (opened till 2pm) but we have not tried the other menu items, although it is on our to-do list...its always the breakfast for us! I highly recommend Matt's, get down there and be ready to grub!"}
{"text":"Well this was a pleasant surprise.  This place is small, a little cramped, but the food definitely makes up for it.    When seated, the waitress was very attentive and coffee was served almost immediately. The menu is small, but full of all the basics, along with the special of the day.   My fiance ordered the special, while I ordered the salami scramble. They are served with toast (white, wheat, sourdough, or cinnamon raisin) and potatoes (hash browns or country fried potatoes). We ordered the wheat, which was served with a chunk of butter melting between the slices and a small cup of jelly. The toast was served almost immediately after taking our order and it was full of nom noms. The service is fast and you never have to wait for a waitress to come by. There is always someone nearby to help.   The prices were very good as well. The average cost of entrees is between $4-8 dollars and the coffee has free refills. The amount of food served is just enough to fill you up with out making you feel like a glutton. They don't take reservations and the place is very small with limited seating so either arrive early in the morning or expect to wait a while."}
{"text":"This is such a cool little place, just about hidden in a little building in a crappy part of downtown Phoenix. It is one of those tiny little diners, with GREAT food. I am so happy one of my co-workers convinced me to try it out. Expect a wait if you go during peak hours. The simplicity of the menu, and the great food it worth the wait though.  Not sure why some of you had such a bad experience... Maybe it's because you went in the summer, I would venture to say that any place that small and that busy would suck in the heat."}
{"text":"I will never understand the hype about this place.  I've been several times, once at its original smaller location and a few times at the new larger one.  And I don't get it.  The food is good, solid fare and you could do a lot worse for breakfast, but I just cannot wrap my head around why people are so nuts about this place.  This place is only worth it if you're willing to get up and go in before 7 so you don't have to wait for a table.  If you see people waiting outside, go somewhere else, because the food is very much typical breakfast food that you could easily get elsewhere downtown.  If you get it, it's very good and the staff are very friendly, but the wait time baffles me."}
{"text":"I have gone to Matt's for lunch several times as I work nearby. Don't be afraid to order lunch- it's as great as breakfast. I enjoyed both the BLT and the tuna sandwich. I go a little after 1PM and have no trouble getting a table.  Don't get me wrong- their breakfast rocks. But don't be afraid to go for lunch."}
{"text":"A bit unorganized for such great reviews. They skipped over our name on the list so the 20 minute quote turned into 40 minutes. We ended up asking to take the stools at the window counter. Server never introduced herself and proceeded to take the guests order who sat down after us.  Our food was delivered one at a time (out of four) with a long delay between dishes. My friend was finished eating before mine arrived. Food was decent except for eggs. Poorly prepared. Server took tip off counter prior to clearing all our plates. Just Strange Culture.  Turn & Burn!  Good quality product."}
{"text":"BAAAAAAACOOOOOOOON. I don't know if people had a weird experience, but I found the service and the food to be delicious."}
{"text":"I think Matt's genius is knowing where to get good ingredients and not messing it up.  I was blown away by the peppered bacon and the rosemary home fries. The waffle was good, but didn't reach the amazing wonder that was the bacon.  But if you're planning for a weekend pilgrimage then prepare yourself well for a super duper long wait, followed by quick rush out of the tiny diner space as soon as you're done with your food.     If you want a nice leisurely brunch then go some place with more seating, or you can take the drive down to Queen Creek and stock up on that incredibly delicious pepper bacon from the Pork Shop."}
{"text":"Great Food, easy menu, worth the wait for seating! Service is fast once you are seated, waiters and waitresses take good care of you...The get o the food. Wow this is my new special place. You like a great breakfast here you go."}
{"text":"do not be fazed by the massive amount of people waiting outside.  just put your name down on the notepad and make yourself comfortable.  the wait on a Sunday morning was 1 hr, which really is not all that bad.  turnover rate is quite fast.  the breakfast was very good and worth the wait.  i had the pork chop and eggs.  the chop was nicely marinaded and cooked well.  the toast was thick cut, with the right amount of butter (i.e. not soaking wet), and came with good strawberry jam with chunks of strawberries.  amazingly, even though the food looked like greasy diner food, it did not taste greasy!  i think it was the butter that made the difference.  i ate every bite of my breakfast and did not feel overloaded.  service was quick and pleasant although i did have to ask twice for ketchup.  seating will be crowded, but you'll be comfortable enough to enjoy your breakfast.  overall, a very good use of my sunday morning."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations, both downtown and in the Biltmore area. The Biltmore location is slower and the wait staff isn't quite as energetic but the food is pretty good in both places."}
{"text":"Great service, great food and amazing Freshly squeezed OJ. The managers are beyond friendly and go over and beyond for their customers."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for Matt's. While you can tell that their dishes are made with care and they use quality ingredients (local, when possible), I feel that this place is a little overhyped. The menu is basically glorified Americana diner breakfasts and, while they do it well and with a charm and authenticity rarely found in Phoenix, it's a little boring. Would it hurt to offer some variations of pancakes and waffles?! The pancakes were good - fluffy with a touch of sweetness - but nothing to phone home about. The standout was their breakfast special of the day - a three egg scramble with white cheddar, hot links, and a pepper they described as in between a green chile and a jalapeno. Proably the best egg breakfast dish I've had in a while. As good as it was, though, I can't imagine waiting a half hour or more for it. Luckily we went on a weekday at a good time and had no wait, but I've heard people wait for hours for this food, and it's just not that spectacular. My other complaint is that, for a place with \"Big Breakfast\" in the name, the portions are no larger than what you'd get at Denny's or IHOP. I'm not a proponent of oversized portions at all - I believe it's wasteful and contributes greatly to our nation's obesity epidemic - but, come on, ya gotta live up to your name. Not only that, but some of the prices are a little steep. $2.50 for the tiniest glass of OJ you've ever seen. Service is great, the place is cute, and the food is good, but the media attention and national recognition on Food Network have overhyped Matt's from what it truly is - a friendly neighborhood spot to grab a good, fresh, hearty breakfast made with care."}
{"text":"I dont cook so eating here just grabbing something simple but when i ate it it was better than i expected"}
{"text":"What a surprise!!!!!!  I love chorizo and eggs and was very worried about ordering at Matts. Hands down the best chorizo and eggs!!!!  I have been here twice and order the chorizo and eggs every time I am sure the rest of the food is good."}
{"text":"Food sucks, service sucks, expensive....don't bother with this location, Denny's is better.."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to have breakfast and Matt's Big Breakfast popped up on Yelp. The restaurant is small and crowded. We arrived at 9:30am on a weekday and waited about 30 minutes to be seated (party of four). The service was excellent and everyone in my group enjoyed what they ordered. I had \"the chop and chick\" which was two eggs, a pork chop, country potatoes and toast. They make their strawberry jam from scratch which was really good. I would definitely go back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Ugh, not so much. Based upon the reviews by AZCentral and New Times, I was looking forward to Sunday brunch in the Biltmore corridor...  Disappointing. Service was more production oriented - more like a breakfast factory than a place to relax and enjoy. Servers were more involved with entertaining each other than ensuring guests were enjoying their meal.   Granted, we came in late (1:30ish) and staff was intent on sweeping the floors, clanging silverware for roll ups, just not consumer friendly. The food was good/ok, but nothing special.   Some of the server uniforms were disgusting filthy - AND obviously not from one or 2 shifts. Atmosphere is about as basic as a government cafeteria...  Try snooze or Breakfast Kitchen Bar in Scottsdale Quarter; Matt's place belongs in metro center."}
{"text":"Food was decent.  Very crowded, but not sure what all the Hoopla is all about.  I liked it enough, but sure wouldn't stand in line for an hour again for so-so food."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! There was no wait at 9am on a Tuesday morning. I tried their daily special which did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5 Ambient: 3.2 Service: 3 Value: 3  3.5 stars  Good traditional breakfast offerings.  In general, a good place to eat. Good bacon and hash browns.  May have to wait out to 30 minutes to get seated."}
{"text":"I have a unique appreciation for smaller, urban, phoenix based spots.  Matt's Big Breakfast was recommended from a few people in my building.  I went there a few days ago and the wait was atrocious.  When I got to my table I was given a menu.  The food seemed fairly common and nothing stuck out.  The waiter seemed too involved with tasks that I assume far surpassed customer satisfaction in importance.  At best, this was a drawn out version of an old, unmaintained, dirty Denny's.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Best airport meal ever. Very fresh and flavorful, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends, on my last day of vacation before heading back to Chicago, and I must say I came to the best brunch place downtown. The homefries are delicious and though I'm not a bacon eater, their thick cut bacon was awesome! I'll definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Scott at Matts BB is absolutely AMAZING!!! Some seriously awesome customer service! Thanks Scott! YTM!"}
{"text":"This is a small place with a big name. Luckly we went after the lunch rush about 1:15 and had to wait only 15 min. This is a small place and we had 4 people, so they had to put two tables together for us. We ordered the griddle cakes, the hog and chick, salami scramble and the chop and chick. The wait time on the food was average and it came out hot and straight from the kitchen (which was not far away). The griddle cakes were very good, light and fluffy. The warm maple syrup and real butter were good touches. The salami scramble and the hog and chick were good , but nothing special. The chop and chick was highly recommended to me so I was excited to try it. The flavor was good , but they over cooked it a bit. It was on the dry side and did not wow me. I did like the hash browns. As a rule I have not found any place that does good hash browns.This place does. Crunchy on the outside without being dry on the inside. The service was good and the overall experience fine."}
{"text":"Breakfast - the most important meal of the day and the best, especially if you get it at Matt's!  My biggest dilemma at Matt's is only solved by deciding I can take home what I don't eat and enjoy it later.   Plus, I have to say no whenever I can to their yummy organic chocolate milk which fills me up before my food even comes.   It is truly hard for me not to get their omelets which are extraordinary.  I get basic ham and cheese and the buttery goodness of the eggs along with the \"real\" ham just make any other omeletes I have had just average eggs.  Then there is the frantic moment when the server needs to know if I want home fries or hash.    Ack!  Both are the best although I have figured out that I can take the home fries home pop them in a pan the next day and my house smells like Matt's and the potatoes make everything I make to go with them taste even better.  They have scrambles on the special board that often tempt me away and the beauty is that they put in what is fresh at that moment.  Everything at Matt's is fresh and they only use the very best.  My other addiction is to their pancakes which just blow my mind.  No matter what we get I tend to get one on the side to share with my husband as while I don't want to get just pancakes I can't turn it away.  The most incredible thing I have ever had there is the Huevos Rancheros.  I even had my name put on a list to be notified when they have them and short of a 3 hour drive back into town I will get to Matt's when they call!  My husband is a true blue chop and chick fan.  He can rarely leave the pesto crusted pork chop to order other things, and then he proceeds to nibble every bit off the bone which he assures me is the whole point of the bone.  He also scores my jam as I am not a jam person and according to him and everyone else it is awesome.  I have bought it at the market from the makers as gifts.  The jam goes on the bread which is another treat altogether. Sliced thick and perfectly buttered it also is good the next day.  Yes the wait is evil but you just have to manage it.  There is no doubt we don't go as often as we would if it were not long.  It is hard to go on most weekends as it is a 3 hour chunk out the day (for us drive time, wait time, and yummy time), but on Saturday's you can put your name on the list visit the market and return to find yourself top of the list.  Don't fear missing your turn for if you mark down you are going to the market they will put you back at the top of the list when you return if they already called for you.  My husband also ventures there during the week as a single and says he is seated within 15 minutes any time.  Please note he is a cruel man and he is told to keep his trap shut about these solo visits as my food envy thunders in.  It is a no brainer 5 star adventure at Matt's.  If the food didn't melt my brain with sensory happiness the adorable picture of the owners' son on the wall certainly gets my heart.  Matt and Erenia keep up the great work (and the cute aprons :-))!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place - hands down.  Always amazing.  Reasonable priced, but they go the extra mile  to make things from scratch.  I have never had a better breakfast lace anywhere!!!!!"}
{"text":"A bargain! I love to be able to write a review like this. Good service and friendly, our server just started working there. I ordered the Chop & Chick with Home fries. eggs over medium. Absolute Perfection. The bone in Pork Chop was tender & cooked perfectly as well as the eggs. Plenty of Home Fries with fresh Rosemary. The Sourdough toast came with a blueberry Compote and lots of butter. I'll be back again when I'm in town. I'm curious to try the one at the airport."}
{"text":"The BEST burger I have ever had in my life.  The Msmacita cooked rare, OMG, the grass fed beef just melted in my mouth.  Whenever I fly through here I hope my layover allows me to make a stop.  Give it a try, and service was great during my visit."}
{"text":"I love Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and it's been a personal quest to try the restaurants on Guy's shows. Matt's Big breakfast was one of those places. By the sight of the long line outside the restaurant at 1230, I had big hopes for this place! We sat down and were greeted with water from a waitress who was dressed for the gym or a booty dance in her too short too tight too small shorts.   The meal- 1) breakfast sandwich. Very tasty! The peppered bacon made the dish. 2) famous has browns- crispy outside but the inside was a mushy mash consistency 3) griddle cakes- fluffy and light, but nothing to write home about.   Service- we asked one of the waiters for an extra plate to share. He brought one with dried omelet residue on, put it on our table, saw the same leftover meal we saw, then proceeded to scrap it off with his nail, then put it back on our table. I didn't know what to do but laugh at the awkward experience, at which the same waiter rushed back and asked if that plate was okay. Oh boy...  Overall good but wouldn't wait again for it"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try Matt's Big Breakfast after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. However, for all the wait, including the hour wait outside the restaurant, it was a \"meh\" kinda place. The waitress in front was great with remembering the parties in line, and keeping you updated so we didn't have to be that annoying couple that keeps looking at her and her list to see how many people in front before us.   Once seated, the busboy brought out 2 plates, one which had old crusty food on it. I asked if I could have another plate because it was dirty, showed him, and then he used his finger nail to pick it off in front of us! Then handed the plate back down. Alright I get this is a diner, but still....your finger nails are not clean! and watching you pick off the food does not make me feel any better. I think he realized his disgusting behavior because after that he asked if I wanted another plate. It's fine I said, just praying I don't get gastrointestinal issues from it!  For breakfast, we shared the five spot, and the pancakes with a side of his famous hashbrowns. The portions are large, but the food was average. The five spot breakfast sandwich was tasty, with thick slices of bacon. But it was okay, nothing to wait an hour for. The hashbrowns were mushy consistency, not the crusty deliciousness Guy made it seem like. And the pancakes were good but again just average."}
{"text":"I ordered grilled Chicken sandwich with avocado and fries for takeaway. Cashier seem to doesn't care for the customer, she didn't provide napkin in the bag, didn't care to offer for ketchup or anything else. When I asked her about after I opened the box, her response was very casual and didn't care about customer experience. Food quality is medium but the experience is very poor."}
{"text":"Best. Waffle. Ever. Oh, and the bacon... man... Super high quality, thick, seasoned well... Def a must have"}
{"text":"Go to Matt's...wait in line if you have to...fight for parking...just go.  I don't like going too early, as the American fried potatoes haven't had the opportunity to soak in enough rosemary and get that nice crisp crust from the grill yet.  Hands down, the best breakfast I've had in the Valley.  Bacon arrives fresh each day...I think everything does.  Coffee is terrific and then there's this woman...(Matt's wife), who just simply lights up the place.    I go to restaurants a lot...more than most...more than I probably should.  I will go once on a recommendation from someone.  I will go back again, if the place measures up.  If I go back more frequently, it's because of the people.  And Matt's is about the people.  I've met great people there and although I maybe get there 5-6 times a year, they remember me.  That's cool...and very important.  Simply put, I have not found a meal there I haven't liked, but most often, the Special of the Day is just out of the world delicious.  Also, just trust me here...get the American fried potatoes...again...trust me.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast today with a friend. The special was a spinach scramble, which my friend had. I had the Belgian waffle.  Both dishes were excellent.  We arrived at about 8:00 a.m. on a Tuesday morning, so no wait at all.    Only complaint: the music was a bit too loud.  Definitely a winner!"}
{"text":"YUM! Great breakfast and service--in an airport?! SO SO good! French toast, sausage, eggs over medium; even their ice tea with fruit infusion is fantastic. Sat at counter: served politely and efficiently. Excellent experience! Matt's and Sky Harbor Airport are recognizing Phoenix and Arizona well. Makin' this home girl proud!!"}
{"text":"Totally worth the wait, for all the people complaining about the wait... If you dont have the patience to wait for quality food, call ahead or go to Denny's. Their portions are very large, and honestly I don't get why that is a complaint, get a togo box and enjoy the rest of your lunch or breakfast later.  Everyone is always friendly who works there and you have to respect the fact that almost all of there food is locally sourced."}
{"text":"Cherry bourbon sausage...amazing. Came here at the recommendation of a friend. They were fast and efficient and only a 7-10minute walk from my hotel."}
{"text":"Wow. I would love to go into details about this gem but I'm too full to do it. So all I'm gonna say is cheese omlette, hash brown, and bacon. What a great day to start a day! Parking is a bitch but... I didn't expect any different."}
{"text":"Its just a regular breakfast joint.  Defiantly not worth a wait in line."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying Matt's Big Breakfast. After seeing it on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives we were really excited to try it. We were off to a good start. The wait staff was pleasant and the coffee was terrific. Classic eggs benedict was the special and I was so looking forward to it. Sadly, the eggs benedict was inedible. The poached eggs were cooked all the way through, the Canadian bacon was dried out and there was no hollandaise to speak of. Home fries were soggy and tired. My plate was picked up basically untouched. The wait staff didn't ask and I didn't volunteer what the problem was as we just wanted to leave. My companions had a very average breakfast with soggy bacon. The bill was pretty high. Needless to say, we won't go back. Such a disappointment. The place is really cute."}
{"text":"Great food, the waffles were out of this world! But there weren't very many options to choose from."}
{"text":"Amazing. Felt like I was back home in Texas at an organic restaurant. Full of love.  Everything was filled with taste. Nothing bland."}
{"text":"I've been coming to AZ for spring traning baseball for the past 6 years. Only this year I was able to discover this little breakfast joint. They have the BEST hashbrown I've ever had and of all places, the best strawberry lemonade. They have a simple menu which is what I like and their service is excellent. The only down side is that this restaurant is too small! We had to wait over 1.5 hr to get seated. But it's worth the wait, so we end up eating there 3 times in 4 days. A+++"}
{"text":"Simple, wholesome ingredients, unpretentious food = home run breakfast.  Coffee was the only let down, it was decidedly watered-out, the classic dinner coffee.    Sign up for a spot on the waiting list and check out the farmer's market that's kitty-corner on Saturdays."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! It is a popular spot so be prepared for a bit of a wait however it will be worth it! Excited to hear that they are opening in Tempe as well! Everything here is so farm to table fresh  and the service was outstanding! Great place to bring out of town visitors in a charming spot of Downtown PHX."}
{"text":"I don't see what the hype is about. Food was good, bacon was incredible but I won't make the 20 minute drive back and 20-30 minute wait to eat there again. Also, not a good spot to bring kids."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite breakfast place in Phoenix.  The pancakes are awesome and all the other food is really good.  Restaurant is very small and the wait can be long.  But the food is worth it."}
{"text":"If your really hunger this is the place for you ! Took home half my meal pancakes were on the mark . Service I little slow . Will be back"}
{"text":"The hash browns are too die for. My omelet was well done, not over cooked, and the strawberry spread is delicious."}
{"text":"Very disappointed... Nice clean place and very friendly staff, but the food just really isn't that good!  The coffee was weak but flavorful, the OJ was good (freshly squeezed), the wheat toast with preserves was good, the pancake was very plain, the home fries were bland and covered in grease, the pork chop was under seasoned/bland, and the eggs were good but greasy.  Not worth the wait in my opinion."}
{"text":"Service very slow ... took 10 minutes to get someone attention at take out counter ... chicken sandwich dried out ... should have gone to Wendy's Not you typical Matts"}
{"text":"Oder eggs, hash brown and bacon person next to Oder the same to go after he had his breakfast because bacon smell great"}
{"text":"Had the Classic Eggs Benedict, it was amazing. Vanessa our waitress was great. Always moving and very attentive. Thanks."}
{"text":"I love love the waffles at this place so delicious sweet and the syrup is tasty.  I've had only pleasant experience's at Matt's.  The staff is also excellent very catering to your needs."}
{"text":"I had the waffles which came with a side of bacom strips. The waffle was good and fluffy but the bacon was burned to a crisp. It was dry, overcooked. The service was pretty bad. The waitress was nice though unattentive. I noticed this with the others there as well. And the music? TERRIBLE!"}
{"text":"There's only one thing to complain about and that is that I got too full to eat more. Great food, hot, fresh, made to order! Got the opportunity to speak with the executive chef and he was an absolute delight. There's no doubt I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Matt's is my fav breakfast place ever! I live in la And want to go to phx all the time just for Matt's:) waffles are the bomb.com.  I love the scramble specials too. Wish I lived In phx!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast place. Not as expensive as a lot of other places you will find in airports. Beer prices vary from $5-8 depending on the size and type. Wine will run you about $8 per glass with a pretty limited selection.  I had the Kilt Lifter draft and it was very tasty and helped my 3 hour layover go by a little easier. (May regret the fluid intake as soon as I board)  I also had two eggs and a side of toast, which for $5 I felt was a steal. I will definitely stop in if I am swing back through."}
{"text":"Hands down, best pancakes I have ever had. I would wait three hours for those babies! Went on a Sunday, waited almost 2 hours and boy was it worth it. I would suggest going on a weekday early morning to avoid the wait but I promise you will be glad you waited! You can also do take out. Oh, and get the orange juice!"}
{"text":"Just plain yummy in the tummy! I love shredded hash browns and they do them up right! I love everything they have, though!"}
{"text":"Go Early or be prepared to wait!  Smallest restaurant ever.  SUPER good food!  I've tried almost everything on the menu.  I've enjoyed it all.  They also have fresh squeezed juice and rosemary potatoes and an interesting bread when they don't have sourdough."}
{"text":"Best waffle I have ever had, and the five spot ain't bad either. Food is a bit greasy, and I recommend going on a weekday."}
{"text":"Great breakfast down to the toast. Delicious fresh-squeezed OJ and the Hash browns were to die for. Ham was a bit tough to cut but good flavor. Was traveling alone for work and enjoyed sitting at one of he window seats. Imagine there'd be quite a wait if it hadn't been 645AM on a week day. Will recommend to friends passing through PHX for sure."}
{"text":"There is nothing bad about this place. It's missing something, and it certainly won't make you say wow. That being said it's a nice restaurant, everything is clean and new, the menu descriptions are well written, there's attention paid to the little details. But the food just isn't that great."}
{"text":"Great simple fresh breakfast menu. Whenever I travel to PHX I make it a point to hit this place. I like the \"skinny\" breakfast but it all looks great"}
{"text":"The Matt's new location at 32nd st & Camelback had me excited that it was coming to my area way before it opened it's doors and tho it was later than anticipated, it was awesome. Back was the great food I'd experienced at the downtown Matt's during their first months of business. The place was crowded again this past Saturday morning around 8:00 when I arrived, but a true benefit of dining alone is no waiting. The server was pleasant and cheerful and FAST. I was seated at 8:05 ate my delicious pancakes and superb bacon and paid my tab all before 8:35. I'm hoping it stays this fabulous, as the downtown spot fell out of favor with after the first year."}
{"text":"Many reviewers indicate that it's worth the wait, and I MUST wholeheartedly agree!  Knowing there would probably be a wait on a Sunday morning, my co-workers and I hustled ourselves out of bed a little earlier than we otherwise would have, checked out of our hotel, called for the valet to bring our car, and drove to Matt's.  I was frankly surprised at how very tiny the building was - I knew it was small, but WOW!  There didn't seem to be *too* many people waiting before us, so we put our names on the list.  We waited probably 45 minutes, and were very glad that it hadn't gotten truly HOT out yet.  Once inside, the place looks even smaller than it did from outside.  We were seated at the bar, which honestly looked a lot less cramped than some of the other tables with \"large\" parties (read: more than 2-3 people).  I think the entire place might seat 20 people?  We were immediately asked for our drink orders (coffee, orange juice and water), then our food orders.  I should have paid more attention to what my co-workers ordered (I know Hayden and Sheri shared an order of pancakes and bacon, and maybe something else, while John also had pancakes and something else with hash browns), but seriously?  Once my Belgian Waffle arrived, there was little room for me to pay attention to anything else.    I can't say I consider myself a connossieur of waffles or anything like that, but I've truly never tried another waffle that even comes close to comparing to this one.  The consistency was absolute PERFECTION!  It was crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and the texture was hearty enough to hold up to the (real!) butter and (real maple!) syrup I subjected it to.  Oh, yeah, I also had the thick-cut bacon.  It was just a little too peppery and a little too done for my taste, but it was still quite good.  John declared the hash browns to be the best he'd ever had, and the pancakes got the same pronouncement from Hayden and Sheri.  Service was spot-on and cheerful.  There's just a couple things I would change about Matt's if I had the opportunity:  A) Expand.  With the demand, they could easily seat and serve twice or even three times as many customers and still have a wait on weekends!  B) Get a public restroom.  My very first desire upon leaving was to find a restroom!  C) Relocate.  Seriously, Austin needs a place this good!!!  I know at least 4 people who would ensure good business forever after..."}
{"text":"I drove by this place several times and Decided to stop by as there is always a line of people outside.  Well was I surprised...now I understand why...great breakfast!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here yesterday morning - early on a weekday with one of my best friends, and had no waiting time.  It was a really nice meal and the staff was really pleasant.  The decor is a little too bright for this early morning wanderer.  I'm not a morning person - I need time to wake up & charge up for the day.  I don't suggest this place for any more than 2.  I suggest avoiding the crowds and going early so that the experience isn't tainted."}
{"text":"I love this place!  They have great specials every time!  This time I got the special which was 3 egg scramble with sausage, cheddar & pepper jack  cheese, and their home fries which are amazing... They grilled onion and a little bell pepper with fresh sprigs of rosemary!  My boyfriend got the pork chop with 2 sunny side eggs and home fries.  His pork chop was delicious & seasoned in loveliness!  We both got their oj... I loved it but my boyfriend added sugar to his.  Everything was amazing! Oh- they also have some of the best pancakes I've ever had... I HAD to have one pancake! Mmmmm"}
{"text":"THE best breakfast EVER!! We have been eating here for 10 years and never have been disappointed. From the fresh squeezed OJ to the homemade jam and bread and everything in between! In fact I'm craving it now and may just head over to get my fix before they close today!!"}
{"text":"Matt's is definitely a go to food place while traveling through sky harbor!  I travel a lot for work and I am always flying out of sky harbor airport, when I do I usually always stop by Matt's. They have a variety of stuff to choose from, everything from breakfast to burgers as well as some great sandwiches. You get a lot of bang for your buck as well, most places in the airport are super expensive and you don't get a lot of food. Matt's gives you great size portions! They are also very quick so if you are in a hurry but don't want to eat fast food, Matt's will get you in and out in a hurry."}
{"text":"Great food and service,  especially considering the location. Best airport food I've had.  Reuben was sloppy and delicious.  Cobb salad had a Mediterranean twist... Kalamata olives and balsamic vinaigrette. Yum!"}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation from a local and were really impressed. There was about a 45 minute wait to be seated and the place was hustling and bustling--but the food and service were both exceptional. The iced teas and lemonades have honey in them, which makes them tasty, but also a little surprising if you're not expecting it. I got the Hog and Chick with bacon, and it was very good. The bacon comes crisp and thick, the eggs are good, hashbrowns were dense but throughly cooked, and the sourdough bread with strawberry jam was buttery and fantastic. I also sampled a little bit of the griddle cakes, and they're light, fluffy, and slightly sweet with a cornbread flavor.   I would highly recommend Matt's Place. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"What a treasure! Warm hospitality, absolutely delicious, fresh ingredients with a real homemade taste. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Breakfast was very good! We had strawberry honey lemonade, waffle and the $5.49 meal. The waffle was sweet and delicious, as was everything else. Bacon was alright, coated in pepper, maybe too much. Gave 4 stars just because of the wait. There was 2 of us and we waited about 45 minutes at around 11 am, but understandable being a very small Venue. Few, but good options on the menu. Overall great experience nice staff, cool little place."}
{"text":"Always great food and smiling faces!!! I know its a breakfast joint but try the butter burger!!!"}
{"text":"Good quick eatery in the B - Gates of the airport.  They are zagat rated which was surprising, but I can tell the ingredients was quality.  Food came out a bit cold and was missing ingredients from what the menu stated.  All considered, I'd go back but not rush back."}
{"text":"Awesome American breakfast joint, the portions are big and the ingredients fresh. This place is small so you may need to wait but going on a weekday morning before work is not to bad  of a wait. This place is a great breakfast place but please no parties of six because you screw the rest of us who want to eat too :)"}
{"text":"The food and coffee were excellent. I got the breakfast sandwich, which was better than my husband's pork chop. The menu was a little ho hum, but I still would go back in a heart beat. The potatoes were very tasty. Get there early, we waited about 20 minutes or so."}
{"text":"I grew up in AZ and did not know about this place until just recently from a friend's recommendation. This is the greatest hole in the wall breakfast I have ever had! Be prepared to wait or make sure to go grab a coffee so you are ready for the 45 minutes you have ahead of you. Also, you write your name on the list yourself outside (we were newbe's and a few skipped in front of us on the list because we were too timid to write ourselves at first until we knew it was the norm). Got the special scramble and the waffle and would recommend both again. Above all though, make sure you try the honey lemonade! It is made with local honey and has the pulp from the lemon in there to show you how real it is. Will be back soon, the service was great as well :)"}
{"text":"Breakfast is off the hook. Crowded but short wait time. Excellent staff. I doubt there is anything on the menu that isn't as excellent as what I ate."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I was one of few in the place. Ordered the Benedict, which was the special, and a coffee and o.j. They couldn't even get the poached eggs right. If that's your special, get it right. Sadly the poached eggs were overdone. I didn't ask for hard boiled eggs. That doesn't bother me so much however they have the audacity to charge $5 for an o.j., or maybe it was $4.50. Whatever. Same damn thing. I can't imagine the profit margin on the juice. Paid 21 and some change for a poorly executed eggs Benedict \"special\", a coffee, and an orange juice. Yikes! Congrats on gettin one over on the suckers that think this is a value. This was my first visit. I don't get it and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast. Is it so good that it warrants all the attention it gets?!? Absolutely not. But like I said before, solid breakfast. Nothing fancy, just plain old good breakfast items that are done right."}
{"text":"WOW! This is one of the best breakfast I've had in years, from the fresh OJ, amazing Cave Creek Coffee, special three egg scramble with bacon, locally grown peppers and fontina cheese, with a tortilla and oh the rosemary home fries... drool. My family took me here and I would recommend this to anyone who lives in or is visiting Phoenix. Tuesday morning we waited about five minutes for a table. This really is the best quality local produce in a great little diner. Next time I'm in Phoenix I will have to try the Butter Burger."}
{"text":"Sooooo overrated.  I've been here three times now and this last time will be my last.  I don't mind a wait if the food and experience are worth it, but when you finally get seated at a teeny table with  not enough room for the plate, coffee cup and flatware and then the menu is limited to Denny's fare and just a hair above their quality....well, just go to Denny's.  I haven't been to Denny's in ten years; it will be longer than that before I go back to Matt's Big Breakfast.  Not a fan of greasy food."}
{"text":"Nice location and you can park in the garage for two hours without a charge. However, Saturday morning breakfast was totally chaotic even though there weren't that many people in the restaurant. Obviously the kinks need to be worked out. Food was OK... Not what it is at other locations of Matt's. I'll give it another try in a few months."}
{"text":"Everything was good including the fresh squeezed oj, eggs and sausage. The griddle cakes weren't my favorite, they were just ehh. My husband had the waffle and that was delicious. It's a small place and seems to always be busy. Service was quick. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I loved that they use all natural fresh ingredients from local farms. The place is small so get there early on the weekend if you want to avoid the wait and I don't think they have a bathroom so get that sorted before going. I was very happy with the overall experience and  I would  highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Love their cheeseburger, can tell it's real meat no 90% fillers! Hotcakes, real maple syrup and best bacon ever! Do expect about 1 to 1hr1/2 wait but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service. I had been wanting to try this place for some time. Put my name on the list up front, checked it three times. The third time my name was scratched off. In this hour of waiting I hadn't even been acknowledged. I love small places like this and don't mind waiting, but I would rather drive to Tucson and wait for a table at Franks or BoBos than go back and try this place again. No food is good enough for an hour+ wait and to be forgotten. Again, don't bother."}
{"text":"I've tried all of Matt's locations and this by far has the best views, seating and overall size (less wait times). The food was the standard Matt's, which is great. The five spot with their special bacon is great. They have great rosemary potatoes. Unfortunately this visit to the Tempe location was not up to par based on the service. Hardly had the waitress come by the table. I asked for water but it never was delivered and had a funky tasting glass of ice tea that I wanted to trade out because there tea is good but this must have been mixed with something or brewed too long. Good breakfast just low on the service scale today."}
{"text":"First time here and was pleasantly surprised! The quick and extremely FRIENDLY service! The food was amazing! Delicious! We hope to be able to come back soon! Ordered the Hog and Chick, waffle, pancakes ! All delish!"}
{"text":"A must for breakfast fans in the valley. You can tell by the pictures they have quality food. Can/will be busy on the weekends. The staff is friendly. I've only ate at the bar and have had the same server...... who is absolutely beautiful."}
{"text":"Breakfast math.  quality real ingredients + cooked  well = Great food  My wife and I stopped by to find that we were too late, the place closed 20 mins earlier.  Nuts!   As we were walking away discussing how we were going to come back another day, the door behind us opened and we were invited in!!! yahoo!!! What a treat.  That never happens!!!  Thanks Matt's you rock!"}
{"text":"This place is just decent nothing spectacular. My family and I went just recently to the downtown location. My waitress seemed to be in a hurry asking if we're ready to order every 30 seconds. The menu sucks in my opinion not enough options to choose from. Also, from the getgo I told my waitress that I will have my drink with my food(apparently she forgot). Instead of her pouring that out she put it in a refrigerator and then brought me the same glass of Strawberry Lemonade once my food was ready. This is just not the place for me. I went to IHOP and got a better breakfast the next day. With a much cheaper bill.   P. S. Original Breakfast House is much better!!!"}
{"text":"This place under-promised and over-delivered. It was a definite whole in the wall feeling, and I'm assuming you should be prepared to wait should you go at peak hours. We went on a Friday morning and had around a 20 minute wait. The food was so fresh and the pancakes were absolutely delicious. They really up the ante on diner fare and go fresh and local. The difference is in the taste. Even the sourdough toast was homemade. Well done...and at a great price."}
{"text":"Good place, real friendly... Good food and drink. Not sure how these folks hold down an airport restaurant though. 10+ min to find a waitress or bartender to order, 10+ min to find someone to pay. If you're in a hurry (as ppl at the airport generally are), consider another option."}
{"text":"This place has perfected the breakfast sandwich. Also, order the hash browns. Awesome breakfast after a tough hike up Camelback Mountain."}
{"text":"Regular old American bacon eggs potatoes breakfast. Like an updated, higher-quality Denny's. High quality ingredients, but definitely not healthy. I couldn't get excited about the menu."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype about this place. Looked up best breakfast in Phx and this is the place that came up. No parking area, had to wait forever outside until I actually got seated inside. Then once I got inside I paid way too much for food that wasn't even good. Maybe I'm missing something,  but needless to say I won't be returning"}
{"text":"Fabulous, fresh food. I was alone and was seated immediately at the counter. The waitress and other patrons were warm and friendly. The coffee mug never reached \"empty.\" This was a good experience. It seems to be a happy place--and the food is special."}
{"text":"BUSY, BUSY Place & I had read LOTS of positive reviews - we waited 50 min. for a table (after being told 30-45 min wait time), crammed 5 ppl. at a table for 4 & could not even hear each other talk it was SO loud.  I was expecting a much larger Menu selection, food was fine when it did arrive but all in all this place did NOT live up to the hype whatsoever.  SO many other good choices for breakfast, we won't be back to Matt's - sorry!"}
{"text":"Ate here once after seeing it on TV and it didn't disappoint. The breakfast was great and plenty of it. The place is small and has a fast paced diner atmosphere. Not fancy but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Great drinks. Delicious salsa. And most importantly the exquisite ice."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Phoenix, or anywhere else I've been.  The toast is soaked with butter, it seems as though a quarter stick per slice was used.  It is tasty but probably not the most healthful, if you're in to that sort of thing.  Small small building and busy busy busy.   If you are dining with the sort of person who demands that they be treated as though they are special and likes to order around the waiters, you may want to go somewhere less crowded."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast in town. All very fresh. The wait staff are wonderful. They don't seem to have a certain area that only they handle. Everyone helps everyone. But get there early, it gets crowded fast....But if you have to wait a bit...it's worth it. Honest"}
{"text":"Friendly service and fresh food.  Both are usually hard to find at an airport. We enjoyed our breakfast very much.  They make homemade bread."}
{"text":"When downtown, for breakfast or lunch this is a great option (best at seating parties of 1-4). Upscale greasy spoon with a short menu that includes all of the standard options. They have a ever-changing daily special that is usually the best option to go with, if it sounds tasty to your likes. Some free parking is available in the back of the restaurant, and in the couple blocks around (mostly metered)."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and I wanted to revisit Matt's.  I was here two years ago and I had heard that they moved, 4 months ago, to a new larger space.     The new space is nice, but I somehow miss the tiny old one.  The little place was unique and atmospheric where the new place is cool, but somehow generic-cool.    Staff was nice enough, but it put me off a bit when they wanted $1.50 for more maple syrup.   I said OK because the pancakes were SUPER DRY.   Not good at all.   And the maple syrup is totally sub par.  Tastes like Aunt Jemima.  It's stored in big plastic jugs in the dining room.     Friend's omelette was overcooked and greasy.   Potatoes were just average.   Thick cut marble rye toast was good, but then he loves anything rye.  Come on Matt, you can do better.   Spend more time training your kitchen staff.  And does your wife always wear UGGs, no matter the weather?"}
{"text":"When we first arrived, there was a long line. Fortunately, the staff is friendly and efficient, so the line went fairly quickly. Service was great, the food (griddle cakes for me, pork chop for my guy) was good and arrived soon after we ordered. The only suggestion I would make is that you don't sit at the counters. The metal stools were so slippery that we had to brace ourselves against the counter to keep from slipping off. Otherwise, I recommend the place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were passing through Phoenix on a road trip and I heard about all the good reviews about Matt's so we decided to try it. The wait to be seated was about 40 minutes but it was definitely worth it! They're wheat bread and strawberry preserves were incredible along with everything else on our plate. Too bad we don't live closer otherwise I would be here all the time!"}
{"text":"100% bomb! Everything they make oozes amazing, homemade, quality goodness. The pancakes are heaven, the hog and chick is fab, and the rosemary breakfast potatoes are perfect. I have been a handful of times, and it's always worth the wait.  Note: This place is ridiculously small (but charming), so don't go with a bunch of friends and expect to sit together...or be seated anytime soon. Carry out is a good option, but only for those who have had the sit in experience first ;)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in town. I always tell out-of-town guests to eat breakfast at Matt's for a wonderful lasting memory on your tastebud and mind!!"}
{"text":"Love the food there and the portions are big.  Service fast and the servers very friendly. My only negative comment is that the stools at the counter area area a stainless steel and very slippery.  I felt that the whole time I was there I was fighting to stay on the stool.  Maybe they should put some non slip strips on them LOL. Or invest in a different style of stool for the counter areas"}
{"text":"I wanted to really love this place because of the reviews, but the food was definitely not worth the wait. Sorry, but not sorry. I was excited for the \"homemade\" pancakes but they were so dry and didn't taste like pancakes should. We also ordered an omelette that was super cold and the cheap sliced cheese wasn't melted. Maybe because it was fake. I give two stars for the good fresh squeezed lemonade, but I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Food was above average I will give them that. Seating is jam packed and a little uncomfortable. I definitely wasn't impressed with the location considering the hype it has. I've been to the one on camelback and enjoyed a much better experience. Wasn't too happy that I couldn't sit at a 4 person table on a Tuesday at noon when there were plenty of spots available. Need my space"}
{"text":"Took our large family to this place at noon on a Sunday, they accommodated us rather quickly for how busy they were with an 8 top booth right next to the host station.  Nice surprise.  Ok the negatives, I've never understood the restaurants with limited beverage menus but this place takes it to a new level.  RC. cola.  Nothing. Else. This might work for the millennials crowd searching for some tough love therapy but how about a coupe of more choices? I get the fresh squeezed OJ and honey lemonade as high margin items for Matts kid's college funds but maybe a clear soda and a diet soda of some kind for the young ones.  The food. Breakfast is the meal I love to take family out to so we do a lot of breakfast places.  This is seriously the best breakfast food I have had in the last year.  Waffle was simple with powdered sugar sprinkled but had this sweet flavor that no doubt came from some kind of ingredient in the recipe.  Incredible.  The cheese omelet with $1 add ingredient  of mushrooms. Wow, simple but another winner.  Older Kids had menu standards of \"hog & chic\" and they raved about it.  I took a bite of the hash browns, not really a hash brown kind of guy but they were unbelievably unique- not crunchy, not greasy, just about right.  The negatives.  Service was pretty sparse. Could be they were overloaded.  They were pleasant and all just not around enough. Sat for long periods with an empty coffee cup trying to make eye contact with someone....bright spot was Lupe.  Attentive to tables that were not even his (ours included) seemed to be looking at the whole place ready to help.  Great part of the crew that lifted the sub par rating of the staff to a passing grade. Funny side note was the manager?host? seating everyone.  Guy was metrosexual hipster caliber right down to the intentional single side front shirt tuck.  I kind of got a kick out of the soup nazi meets Nev Schulman  attitude but the older kids were annoyed...."}
{"text":"Still good as ever.  They have Moved one block up so there isn't a ridiculous waiting time anymore.  I usually go by myself so always sit at the bar/counter area.  Staff is super friendly and my usual:  Waffles with bacon, OJ, and black coffee.  I always end up going there after I land at the airport.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I really thought this place was going to be super good. The menu was limited and the food was good but not as great as everyone makes it out to be. I will not be back."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place for breakfast. Prompt service, great coffee and good food.   I ordered the Five Spot and my other three family members ordered Thursday's special- Eggs Benedict. Everybody at the table was happy with their food, the waiter was courteous and we had our breakfasts on the table in very short time. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I've visited.  Everything we had was fresh and tasty.  Service was great.  A bit hipster, but well balanced by smiles and quality eats."}
{"text":"My bacon came from the pig in back, the rosemary in the breakfast potatoes came fresh from a garden in back right next to the chicken coop that layed the eggs that went into the waffle mix.....at least in my mind, because that's how fresh all of the ingredients tasted."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. The service is too notch and the prices are reasonable. If you are looking for a breakfast spot, this is it!"}
{"text":"The fam and I were hitting some DDD spots last week in Phoenix while we were out there from LA, and we had to hit Matts.  I've actually thought a lot about this place since, and I have to say I dig it.  It has a serious funky factor - it's tiny, loud and the servers are friendly and outgoing.  As for the food, the pancakes were rock star - absolutely delicious.  If I was on death row getting my last meal, those cakes would send me to the great beyond in peace.  Other foods were good, and I don't get the deal with everyone saying the coffee is crappy - it's better than chain restaurants, so I don't know what the problem is.  There is one thing that's keeping me from giving it 5 start.  While we were there, about 5 minutes after we ordered, the power went out on the whole block.  To their credit, they finished our order, but the place heated up and filled with smoke from the grill (the fans weren't working), and by the end of the meal we couldn't see the back of the restaurant from the smoke.  That's fine and all, but someone called Matt and he came down and was stomping back and forth through the restaurant - walking around outside, back in, back outside.  The place was full, and it would have been appropriate for him, as the proprietor to talk to the customers, let us know what's going on - he didn't do anything, and we were all just staring at each other and him.  It was a weird scene - he could have set everyone at ease, and at least poured everyone some free iced tea, but there was nada.  Power failures aside, the place is the bomb, and just what a breakfast place should be."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've ever had! Get the Hog and Chick and the chocolate milk. The thick cut bacon is awesome... My only negative is the wait is about 20 minutes at 9:00 and gets longer as the morning goes."}
{"text":"I've been hearing good things about this place for so long, it was ridiculous I hadn't yet been. I'm all about supporting local business & breakfast is my favorite meal, so this past Saturday I decided to check it off my foodie bucket list. I met 2 friends at 10am. One of them had gotten there at 945 and put our name on the list for a table of 3. Almost 1 hour later, we were seated at a 2 top with an additional chair pulled up. To start, a hipster waitress wearing a huge gold watch and too many bracelets asked what we wanted to order after we had been seated for no more than 2 minutes. Menu-  I've been craving French toast all morning. Come to find they don't have French toast. \"French toast is seasonal\". Really? Waitress is back again asking what we want after an additional 2 minutes. I ordered a waffle that came with 2 pieces of bacon for $7.50. Waffle was good, served with real cream butter. They do have real maple syrup which is a plus. The bacon was thick, but peppered on the sides which I don't like. Maybe I'm greedy but I also think they should have given 3 slices for a $7.50 plate. I also ordered a cup of coffee (which admittedly I am a coffee snob). Ick.  Burned and watered down at the same time. Needing the extra caffeine, I got my coffee refilled once the cup had been empty for almost 15 mins. I actually asked a server passing by twice if they could refill it.  They never did bring the creamer I asked for (also twice) so I couldn't even drink the 2nd cup. All in all, we waited entirely too long for a crowded place whose food was nothing to write home about. Our bill was almost $50 including tip for 3 people. I recommend you skip this hipster spot that has been hyped up entirely too much. Simply doesn't meet up to expectations IMO. If I'm craving a hipster breakfast and am prepared to shell out $50 for 3 people, I will swing by Postino's for brunch on Saturday/Sunday and get a meal with fresher ingredients and much better coffee and service. Likely a shorter wait, too."}
{"text":"This is a kind of place I picture of when I see that Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives show on tv. That obviously not being an insult. This place is a must try. Little loud but the food and prompt service made up for it."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious breakfast!! Waited a little more then an hour but the bike/coffee shop down the road is the best time kill."}
{"text":"Loud, crowded, overpriced, mediocre.   Poached eggs came with the whites uncooked and gooey - Twice! Pork chop which was recommended by server was dry and bland.  They are not friendly for allergies or food intolerances. I ordered almond milk and they brought regular milk. They did not offer a substitution for toast.   I gave two stars instead of one because someone (manager?) did come to the table and tried to assist, but there's only so much you can do when every food item received was unacceptable.  Not worth the price or the wait. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here the past 3 years. Other than the wait being long, the five spot sandwhich and waffle make this place one of my favorite in the nation."}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch, and ordered the AM special. The special was originally a 3 egg scramble with provolone cheese, ham, and fresh locally grown organic spinach. I subbed out the ham for their amazing bacon, and this was definitely a treat! I got this with white toast and their delicious home fries (they're the best I have ever had).   It's too bad Matt's doesn't open more locations around the valley. I really wish they had one closer to Scottsdale/ Tempe. I would be there 4 times a week!"}
{"text":"Loved it the pork chops were Amazing and the jam and bread was the best honestly long wait.. But definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast Place I've ever been to hands down.  The bacon is heavenly, and the pork chop is amazing.  I usually just go for the special of the day when it is a scramble, can never go wrong with that.  One thing though is that they recently made their hash browns thin cut.  I miss their thick cut hash browns, they were the BEST.  Please go back to your thick hash browns Matt's!"}
{"text":"The wait can be a bit extreme at time but if you bring a friend to talk to it helps the time pass.  However, I wouldn't recommend waiting out there in the heat if it's 100+ outside that's for sure.  As for the food, the pesto pork chops and rosemary potatoes will satisfy any man's appetite.  In general, the handful of times I have been there never disappointing but I also have never been blown out of the water either.  I will still keep going back though."}
{"text":"Like many others saw this place on triple D.  Have eaten here a couple of times since and have enjoyed it every time.  Go out on a limb and order some of the odd combos they have as speacials and you won't be sorry.  A lot of people complain about the wait however there is one sure fire cure for it.....get up a little early and be there prior to 8am and the wait will be very short.  A group of 8 of us arrived at 745 and were in at 8am.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Big Portions.  Come hungry.  Leave satisfied and fat.  Food quality is top notch and you MUST try the bacon.  Peppery, thick cut, and just as good as bacon gets. I had the special (which was eggs benedict). Sauce is a little on the sweet side but really very good.  No shortcomings here.  Great place for high-energy, busy breakfasting to get your a$$ going!"}
{"text":"Just walk by...food was cold, although our server was very nice she forgot to bring toast and hostess was rude. Giving the place 1 star is a stretch"}
{"text":"OMG, you must be kidding and this place is in business?? so i have heard of Big Matts and wanted to try it. This afternoon i went their for the first time and what a JOKE. first of all i arrived at 12:15 PM and the front door was locked. I asked couple of men that were standing outside how to you get in this place and they told me from the front door, which i was standing in front of. So i knocked on the door and the server opened the door. My first thought is to the owner, dont be cheap and just go ahead and get a real lock for the front door. Then I asked servers where the bathroom was? she told me they dont have one, however they share one with the hotel next door. (this is not a Hilton by the way). I asked i just want to wash my hands. She told me they had hand sanitizer up front. so i used it . I understand the place is small, however, there is health requirement and I am not sure how they pass this. I believe the employees would wash their hands more then once a day. CAUTION!!!! HEALTH.   Food. the server was nice and took my order. I asked for their best item on the menu and she highly recommended the daily special. Okay that is what i will get. I got two scrambled eggs, fresh motezzerla, sausage (disgusting) and sweet peppers, this was served with home potato's and toast. how bad can the eggs be, the sausage was uneatable, the potato's were full of Rosemary, and ONE slice of toast for $ 8.95. I have been to numerous breakfast restaurant  and never remember being served ONE slice of toast. Please dont be cheap for $ 8.95 you can serve two slice of toast.  I am not sure what the hype is about this place, i will never go there. if you want breakfast go somewhere else like \"the breakfast club\"."}
{"text":"Great food, quick service, good atmosphere! The hash browns and omelette were delicious."}
{"text":"Great food! The Hog & Chick is perfect! Eggs cooked properly which is a challenge for most places.  Average service.   Glad to see Matt's expanding."}
{"text":"The service  was good however  the food  was very greasy.  The ham was very salty and the rosemary  potatoes  was full of oil. Not allot to chose from the menu. Had a waffle  for dessert  and was really  good."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast prior to my flight. This location not as good as original in downtown Phoenix. Matt needs to oversee more."}
{"text":"Have heard so much about Matt's but never tried it before, so waking up early on Sunday, I decided to head over and check it out. Got there around 7:30 this morning, and it wasn't very busy yet-plenty of open tables and counter space. I picked out a table and noticed the Sunday Special of steak and eggs. Decision made. It did take my waitress a couple of minutes to come over, but no biggie (for now). On her first approach, I ordered iced tea, and the steak and eggs (rare and over easy eggs) plus sour dough toast. The food came up very  quickly...Unfortunately, it was the last interaction I had with my server until I was finished. The food was very good. The home fries were delicious, tender chunks of potatoes, sauteed with onions, salt and pepper and rosemary.(A little heavy on the rosemary for my tastes, but that is just me) the eggs were a perfect over easy. The steak was a flavorful centercut sirloin, cooked to a perfect rare as requested. I always worry a little about sirloin being a tougher cut, but it was tender for sirloin. The toast was a slice of thick cut sourdough, definitely NOT straight out of the grocery store. On the side of the toast was a ramekin of some sort of homemade preserves. I couldn't quite figure out what it was, though.  Food gets a definite \"A\".   Service on the other hand, left me wanting more.. As I was waiting for my food, (and while eating), I noticed that the waitresses all kept huddling up and talking, instead of working. I never got a \"check back\" to make sure everything was ok. Especially when ordering a steak, it should be done quickly to make sure the steak was cooked correctly. I never was offered a topping off or a refill on my iced tea. Even when I was finished with my meak and my glass was empty, the waitress finally came over and offered clear my plate, she still did not offer a refill..  I would come back for the food, the another poor service experience would make me reconsider a third visit."}
{"text":"We didn't end up eating here because there was a weird vibe in there. The waitresses were staring at us and one waffle with nothing else is $9."}
{"text":"ate there this am. Waited 45 min. This is part of the culture of this place so be prepared to wait. The food was great. We had the special, extra bacon and lemonaide. this bill was 30 bucks including tip. I am a fan. If you are not a fan of the AZ heat, you may want to wait until fall to chow down. It's hot outside and hot inside. It's a tiny place with great food! The bacon is yummy and the toast is THICK sliced with homemade jam.( Didn't have coffee cuz we got it across the way while we waited for our time to eat.)"}
{"text":"Great place! Local fresh food, fast service, always delicious! Great location and views as well!"}
{"text":"Good if you like your food cold and over-cooked."}
{"text":"First off I LOVE this place! I have never been disappointed with the food or service. If you love breakfast food this is your place. You have to try the Salami Scramble with home fries (which are the best damn potatoes this side of Idaho).  Also, if you're lucky the special of the day might be the eggs benedict that are making me hungry just thinking about them.  If you get there around 11:00 am be prepared to wait but they will seat you pretty fast. The customer service is great and the prices are cheap! Don't come here if you want a healthy breakfast because it won't be but it will be some of the best breakfast food you will ever have!"}
{"text":"Great Service from the moment you walk in! Food tasted good and good presentation! Martha was great!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to rain on people's parades in Phoenix, but this place is average. Is it good for breakfast? Absolutely. Is it worth the hour-plus wait people go through every weekend? No way.  The couple of times I've been there, service has been okay. Friendly servers, but slow with refills on drinks. Also feels rushed - who can blame them with lines out the door? Atmosphere is loud and a little cramped, but not terribly uncomfortable.  The food is good. I would go back, don't get me wrong. But is it anything special? Not really. I've had pancakes there as well as eggs with bacon, and it's pretty standard."}
{"text":"The menu is extremely limited and the service here was HORRIBLE! The workers weren't too friendly, except for two of the guys that worked there. The portions were decent sizes but the food definitely wasn't worth the price. At the end we split the bill and when we told the girl that she had split the bill wrong she started to argue with us so we just decided to pay the incorrect total and leave. We are definitely NEVER going back there."}
{"text":"I would totally give this place a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the long wait. The food was delish!! My kids had the waffle which is huge and the real maple honey is to die for. The staff is very attentive and friendly. If you have time to kill due to the wait and want some yummy breakfast, then this place is it!"}
{"text":"Flippin' AMAZING! Portions as big as your head. Bring you appetite and check your diet at the door. There was a short wait, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews, we finally went to try for first time.  Between the long wait time just to be seated, poor service, the constant waiting and having to ask for refills.  We even went to the front and asked for our check rather than continuing to wait for it.  The food was good no doubt about it, but with as much hypster hype as there has been about Matt's Big Breakfast, we expected better.  Probably wont be back...."}
{"text":"Matts Big breakfast is great.  We go there frequently.  Yes it is small but isnt that part of the deal that makes Matts place special?  I think so.  They really do a great job of using every inch of the place to feed hungry patrons.  Almost always the service is quick, and typically the staff is helpful.  There has been the occasional bump in the road but we go there often and everyone can have an off day.....I will be back!   If you want a great breakfast Eat at Matts!!!!!"}
{"text":"Greets spot for breakfast. We waited an hour for a table on a Monday morning which I assumed would be dead. Once seated we were helped right away. The menu was small but a thoughtful selection of breakfast and lunch options. I had the salami and scramble with home fries. Delicious. The salami was a perfect salty meat for the eggs. The home fries were perfectly seasoned and the Orange juice was amazing. Who knew OJ could be that good. I thought this was a great breakfast and well worth the wait. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I had their belgian waffle, which came with bacon and advertised real cream butter and real maple syrup. Also got orange juice and my girlfriend got a salami-egg scramble thing.  The lady's salami-egg scramble was great (and a new taste!) but my waffle was THE BEST WAFFLE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. I sipped my tiny $2.50 (I think) orange juice and FELL OFF MY CHAIR, AMAZED BY THE DELICIOUSLY SWEET FRESH SQUEEZED OJ.  After being revived by my frantic girlfriend, I quickly JUMPED UP AND HUGGED EVERY EMPLOYEE IN THE BUILDING.  True story.  We went at 1:30 PM on a Sunday and sat right down-- your mileage may vary as this place is apparently legendary and I hear can attract quite a crowd when busy. There's like 10 small tables in the whole place plus a bar, and virtually no parking, and no shade, so don't expect to be catered to (outside of delicious food.)  Also, Matt has inspired a new invention: fresh squeezed orange juice shots. Seriously, I'd buy a few if they existed."}
{"text":"They have Mr. Pibb. That's fun. I first read about Matt's in an America West in-flight magazine and put it on my list of places to go.  You know the wait was about 20 minutes, the staff was quick and the food was good. I would say the biggest appeal about Matt's is that it seems like the food is reliable, you go there for breakfast and guess what you get it straight up.  What I most appreciate, is that Matt saw potential in an old downtown building and is doing his part to bring business to that part of town."}
{"text":"One of the best morning meals I've ever had. The griddle cakes and chicken apple sausage were so, so, SO good. The atmosphere is real laid back and the service is excellent here. Next time I come to Phoenix I will most definitely be eating here."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with a nice fluffy waffle! The waffle comes with thick cut bacon that's delicious but a bit too peppery for my taste so I sub sausage (doesn't cost extra).Yummy light maple syrup. My boyfriend is literally obsessed with their pancakes and could probably eat them everyday! Definitely plan on ordering the french toast special on Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Had friends in from out of town and had heard how great this place was so why not.  Visited on a Saturday morning (8:30am).  Very busy, long wait and parking is a challenge. P.S. feed the meters. I didn't get busted but lots of others received parking tickets on the street.   We had a variety of meals (breakfast sandwich, cheese omelet, hog and chick and a special of the day) and waters around (for four people).  The meals were good, wouldn't say great.  The ambiance was less than desirable.  It's very loud, very cramped, not very comfortable and rush, rush, rush.  It felt as if they couldn't get your order quick enough and get you out the door even quicker.  We had plans so the speed was ok.  What I later found annoying was that I had been grossly overcharged.  This is partially my fault, as I should have checked the check, but the rushed atmosphere along with my trusting nature, (I just gave her the credit card to settle up, without looking at the check) got me in the end.  Looking at the check later, I realized we received another tables check as there were six meals and drinks on the ticket and we had only four people in our group.  In the end, I was overcharged about $20, not including the 25% tip I left on the overinflated bill.  My fault, just a warning to beware due to the extreme haste at this place."}
{"text":"It's in a great location; I have to give it that. However, the food is not worth the long wait! My friend and I waited 45 minutes to get seated. We knew what we wanted right away and ordered the steak Sunday special (medium rare), the five spot, waffle plate, and one pancake on the side. They brought out my steak well done and although more than willing to cook me a new one, the new steak was still subpar and quite pricey at $15! The waffle was soft and kinda deflated. The five spot was pretty good, but our pancake on the side never came out. The overall experience was meh, but the long wait on top of the subpar service gives this place an overall 2/5 score. Pass!"}
{"text":"I rarely agree with the culinary opinions of Guy Fieri, Human Cheese Fry, but I guess even a stopped clock is right twice a day.    For about a year, I was at Matt's once a week when work would take me from North Phoenix to Tempe.  Service was nice, food was good, prices were silly, chairs were cramped, pretty much what you'd expect.  But after a while, I realized I was paying around $8 for eggs, bacon, toast and hash browns.  Sure, it was good, but it was a little much.  Still, I stop by Matt's every once in a while to enjoy the food and atmosphere.  It's a great place to take your vacationing relatives, foodie friends, or other people who you wouldn't mind being crammed into a small space with.  HOWEVER: If you stop by after around 7 AM on most weekdays, or at all on a weekend, be prepared to wait.  The weekend lines are ridiculous; you can hear people proudly proclaim how they woke up at 2:00 AM to drive down from Flagstaff to get the food.  Plan accordingly."}
{"text":"What can I say about Matt's?!  I feel very lucky that a friend stumbled upon this place and shared it with me in the early years.  Well worth the wait and one of the best not so hidden gems in town.  There is only one thing keeping me from 5 stars.  Tabasco... really?  In my humble opinion, a breakfast restaurant with no Cholula or Tapatio is missing the essentials.  Tabasco is bush league and Matt ... that is one thing you are not.  Your wife is hispanic, right??  C'mon brother - ditch the tabasco and get the real stuff.  Even your cooks keep a stash of the good stuff."}
{"text":"I reached out to management via their website to point out a problem I had at PHX airport B terminal location. They seemed concerned and interested in my input. Then I got a message telling me to call them 5 days later. It makes sence they would contact me and ask for a good tome to call ME. I'm a customer trying to voice a legitimate concern. I told them i would still try it again and report back to them. I never heard back. I dont think they realize frequent flyers like me try to find good reliable places to eat and become regulars. I even offered to come back again! And let them know how it went. But by not bothering to contact me again shows they dont care. They must figure most people will come in only once. No interest in cultivating a reliable consistent customer base means they will miss out on alot of revenue. Most people do NOT bother to write reviews. They just dont go back. BTW the reason i contacted them was that my big beautiful salad had all white chopped up romaine lettuce. They use very low grade romaine. And then try to hide it by chopping up the white lower part of romaine heads. I assumed they got the white super finely chopped by mistake from thier produce purveyor. And simply wanted to point it out. But their decision to not follow up tells me the very low quality romaine is the norm. This restraunt is designed for tourists I'm guessing. One time only customers. To bad they dont care. I could have been a regular customer as i fly through PHX 4 times a month. Keep it up and you will close in 18-24 mo."}
{"text":"We decided to go to the Phoenix location for Father's day breakfast. Hubby saw them featured on Triple D.  While yes the wait was long (almost an hour) we felt the food was well worth it.Hubby and I don't like blueberries and I am not a real big fan of eggs, but their blueberry jam is so amazing I wanted to buy some to take home (which you totally can!). They even cooked my eggs the way I wanted (done very well) without me having to send it back to cook longer. The food was so much and so good that we couldn't finish, but we wanted to so badly. Will definitely come here again and wait."}
{"text":"I have been to Matt,s mean time and had good food but this time was not good in matter-of-fact it was of-full . The potatoes where undercook. The sausage was sliced but dried out and chewy. I just paid and left. I will go back someday."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Bland. If this is what Phoenicians rave about, no wonder they're so unhappy..."}
{"text":"Been here twice - best breakfast in town. You will have to wait - but the staff set the right expectations, so you know exactly how long you're waiting. Once you sit down - they are fast, efficient and again . . the food is outstanding.  Good job Matt's. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We sat at the bar so we could see the food go out. It all looked and WAS great. Fresh squeezed juice, homemade preserves, strawberry honey lemonade."}
{"text":"One of the best \"diner style\" breakfasts I've ever had. I ordered the \"chop and chick,\" a rosemary slathered pork chop with 2 eggs. The chop was (at my request) cooked with a perfect pink center and the \"over easy\" request on eggs was executed perfectly. Great, friendly service, too!"}
{"text":"Delecious! Big servings and helpful staff. Their menu is a bit small, and the lines often require a 60min wait, so come early! We only waited 5 min. Not sure I would have waited 60!"}
{"text":"Yeah, Matt's definitely deserves 5-stars.   Did I have to wait longer than normal for a Wednesday morning before 8 AM? Yep. But I knew ahead of time that Matt's has some hefty wait-times. (As long as I know ahead of time that I'll need to wait, I never have a problem with it.)  The service, once we were seated inside, was awesome. The waiter came over and saw that we were ready to order and didn't dally at all. He took our order and drinks at the same time. Within 10 minutes, our food was in front of us. I think that is impressive - for a place with such a long wait time, once you're inside, they get you eating as soon as possible.  I had the salami scramble. I loved the huge strips of salami. The eggs were cooked perfectly - not too runny, but definitely not too cooked and dry. My friends had the chicken sausage with artichokes scramble (it was a special). They were both as happy as I was.   Matt's is worth it. Go, have a great time with your friends, and eat a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Loved the food especially the hash browns! I do wish they had offers for soda as a drink option."}
{"text":"I like the bright, small-diner atmosphere and the use of cage-free eggs, organic produce and grain-fed natural Iowa pork and Angus beef.  I found the rationale stated on the backs of the menus and on the website, \"We believe that food prepared this way not only tastes better but is better for you\" quite ironic considering the amount of butter and olive oil their food is fried in.  My stomach couldn't take it.  I guess if I go back for breakfast, I can always get the Frosted Flakes for $4."}
{"text":"School teacher with a summer vacay mission: eat breakfast at every joint in town that you can't normally go to without waiting in a weekend line!    Matt's was at the top of the list!  Five stars for the buttery delicious waffle - a little crisp on the outside, a soft and tender inside and the BEST bacon in town. 2 stars for the chop and chick, eggs and skinny over-cooked pork chop with the wimpy soft breakfast potatoes. I'll round up to 4 for the ROCC bottomless coffee and the nice counter waitress. (BTW, do all restaurants just top off the creamer containers from other tables and give them to someone else? Maybe that's standard but it kind of freaked me out.  Maybe it's better for me to just not know!)"}
{"text":"Amazing service and great portion and food. Thanks yelp! This place has many great ratings for a reason! Hmmmm bacon!"}
{"text":"We had to wait about 35 minutes,  but once we sat down service was very quick! I got the special scramble and my husband got the waffle. Both were very tasty!! Coffee was good. The toast and preserves with some bacon are a must. It was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"took car for repairs this early this morning and had time before taking friend to work so he said, \"Where are we going for breakfast?\"  I said, \"I don't know, where are you taking me?\"  Realized we were in area of Matt's Big Breakfast, looked it up on Yelp for address and decided to try it.  Special today was Eggs Benedict with choice of hash browns or home fries.  I normally don't like poached eggs but thought I'd give it a try.  Glad I did.  The hollandaise sauce was delicious, the canadian bacon was very flavorful, nice sized english muffin and I choose hash browns which were soft and moist but a little too dark.  friend got the 3 egg salami sopprosata omelete (sure spelled wrong) with hash browns and oj.  the homemade, organic strawberry preserves they serves with his toast was amazing.  not too tart, not too sweet, just wonderful.    will go back again, however, probably not during the snowbird season.  we were able to get right in this morning and we did hear some regulars talk about how it was nice to see so many people in there today, considering it's now off season for visitors.  apparently, as others have indicated, there can be very long waits to get in."}
{"text":"I had the scrambled eggs special with ham and sweet peppers and home potatoes. The herb smell and flavor notes were very lively."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place on Yelp. We order the Omelet with the Wisconsin cheddar cheese with hash browns/home fries and sourdough toast. I have to say it's some of the best brunch food I've ever had. The omelets were perfectly cooked and loaded with cheese/ham. The hashbrowns were perfect and the toast was to die for! To top it off the service was prompt and friendly. We will come back if we are ever in the area again!"}
{"text":"One of the must in Phoenix. Really nice breakfast before heading off to work/visiting."}
{"text":"After seeing all of the reviews when we first moved out here, we decided to give it a shot one morning while exploring Phoenix. We really weren't all that impressed. The food was \"ok,\" the service was \"ok,\" the dining area left something to be desired, for sure, and was incredibly noisy. I guess if we're around the area and literally can't find anything else, we may stop by again... But it was just \"ok.\" We don't understand the hype."}

{"text":"First time here, service was excellent the portions where big and the rosemary potatoes where awesome"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place for breakfast. Try the hog and chick . Daily specials are sure to please"}
{"text":"Just as everyone says, the food is awesome! BUT...if it's served with an attitude, damn it drags the experience down. I was totally disappointed in the place. Maybe a too go order would be good for you? Food is still good enough to fetch four stars."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast has fresh squeezed juices and big portions. My cheese omelette was chock full of lots of cheese and the thick cut toast was so satisfyingly good. Had a side of savory ham, so delish! Love this cute breakfast place."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot. Reasonable prices for a great meal. Biscuits and gravy were delicious."}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday. It's not a huge place but we got seated immediately. The staff were all very polite, friendly and attentive. I got breakfast potatoes, ham steak and eggs. Usually I would comment on the meat, but the potatoes were brilliant! It was all served in a timely manner and prices weren't ridiculous. My meal was about 9. Which is standard these days I think.   Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My friends and I found this restaurant via Siri and Yelp. The reviews were so great that we had to go! We went on a Sunday around 11...bad move! Our wait was about an hour. While the food was very tasty,  I'm not sure that it was worth the wait time.  Our service was average; we kept having to ask for small things like spoons. One of my friends had the special,  chicken artichoke sausage and eggs which were delish! Another friend had pancakes and apple wood sausage; pancakes were good but sausage was burnt. Got a free replacement but it arrived lukewarm!  And there was a moderate cost for extra syrup. I had the hogs and chick breakfast which was great.  Nice place but next time we will plan a better time to come."}
{"text":"The location was cool and trendy I loved the decor. Our waitress was very friendly and professional but the other one was showing too much cleavage for a breakfast cafe setting.  My pancakes were dry and not very tasty although the portion size was huge. They were also crumbly sort of like cornbread which I don't really find to be appealing for pancakes.. They had a very organic \"made from scratch\" taste but not as good as what my mom could make from scratch and she's not a good cook. The jam was very delicious. The lemonade was heavenly. It was very noisy. My husband ordered the porkchop with hashbrown and eggs. He decided his favorite thing was the jam. He normally doesn't like sweets and is a huge meatlover. The porkchop wasn't very flavorful husband thought it was dry too. Both of our menu items could have tasted better. They were quick service was great. I was expecting more of the food. The quality in the ingredients was there I'm assuming organic maybe local? But our breakfast just wasn't that flavorful. Maybe it was what we ordered? After trying our food we both regretted our choices and left disappointed."}
{"text":"As the 5 stars show \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" Ok, it is only breakfast but  great, consistent fair. Tiny little place so you will have to wait but they keep the folks rolling in and out. Been there twice and have sat at the counter both times. The Hog & Chick with bacon, thick bacon...awesome!  Eggs the way you want. Get the hash browns as they are better than you can make at home, but if you like your potatoes chunky then get the home fries but a warning for people who aren't into rosemary, home fries have rosemary on them. Fresh sliced toast and homemade jam, I think it was plum. My wife had the omelet and loved it."}
{"text":"I travel a lot....thrilled with new restaurant options. Matts is first disappointment.   20+ min for a less than mediocre Reuben.  Olive & Ivy much better and worth the hike to A gates.....and most likely faster!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times each time better than the last no the best for little one big still greatest pancakes and if you can get the cherry sausage do it in it a big meat consumer but omg this black heresy sausage was to die for and don't get me started on the coffee !!!!! Love this place only four stars cause the long wait .. But well worth it"}
{"text":"Great quality breakfast food with awesome drink selection. Friendly staff, wide menu selection and fast service. I almost forgot I was in a airport, one of the best restaurants in sky harbor. Full size bar, to-go ordering and open late with breakfast served all day! I have hard time seeing how anyone wouldn't like this place! It is a little pricey but not bad at all for being in a airport. This place is now a regular stop for me when I'm flying out of sky harbor!"}
{"text":"Matt's new location is bigger, but they have preserved the ambiance that makes Matt's a breakfast destination.  It doesn't matter how big they make the diner; there will always be a line to get in there!  The simple secret is the fresh, real ingredients they use, locally-sourced whenever possible.  When you're a regular, they know your name and your order.  Big plus, in my book, is the new digs have a bike rack.  LOVE Matt's Big Breakfast!  It truly is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"So we waited for a table for an hour. in the winter. and it was windy. my hair was flying, my fingers were freezing and I was getting increasingly annoyed. why cant they expand their space just a little bit? The waitress kept running outside to check people off their list, and started handing out menus so that we could order. It took the joy of of looking at the menu and deciding what to eat. I was looking forward to a nice leisurely brunch after which we planned to go to the museum.  We would have left, except that this was downtown Phoenix and dint want to lose our parking spot.   Finally, after a little more than an hour, we were seated. the place is TINY. Tables are close together and just as luck would have it, we got a table right next to the door, where every time she opened it, i was greeted with nice gush of COLD air. And people waiting outside could see us sit in the warmth and eat.  That being said, the food was excellent. I can't seem to remember names of our dishes, but the eggs were very good, with potatoes, toasted sourdough bread, orange juice and coffee.  But was the wait really worth it? I don't know! I don't think I'd want to wait for so long for a table. I'd recommend this place to friends for sure though. I think I just contradicted myself! don't get me wrong - excellent food. just that the waiting pissed me off. a lot."}
{"text":"Ribeye Steak and Eggs... Best Breakfast in 15 years of traveling.  Be prepared for a bit of a wait.  Great service!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Really only wanted a bite and cocktail waiting on delayed flight. How hard is NO Butter on toast? Sent it back 3x and it was never returned correctly. This was a side no less. One scrambled egg and dry rye fiasco. If that wasn't enough, she swooped my drink away with 2 sips left."}
{"text":"THERE IS NO BETTER BREAKFAST IN THE CITY! You will most likely wait a few minutes for a table but it is time well spent.  I give Matt's Big Breakfast 5 solid stars for friendly and efficient service,  the finest ingredients and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix I went to Matts for breakfast!!! Everything was delicious! The waffle, honey lemomade, breakfast and surprisingly the sourdough bread with the homemade blueberry jam was AMAZING! Make sure you order sourdough and blueberry jam!"}
{"text":"This review is for their location in the Phoenix SkyHarbor Airport, which my friends tell me is every bit as good as the main one.  I love Matt's Big Breakfast. Great food - some may say comfort food - but done in a way to make it even more enjoyable and healthy at the same time. I've never had anything bad here. The only problem is that it is so popular - even in the airport - that you need to make sure you have the time to wait if it is busy!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in Phoenix! The scrambles are off the charts, as are their home fries. Yum!"}
{"text":"Went in with my Son 5 and My daughter who is 18 months. We got seated in 2 top table with the high hair between the 4 top next to us, very tight squeeze. Especially alone ugh two children and other patrons next to is it just didn't seem logical and I would have gladly waited for a better spot than we were in. What really gets me is that they don't have a kids menu at this location??? Really... for being in such a location that has families surrounding it and to not have a option for kiddos is just outrageous. On the family note again, the food can take sometime and they don't supply any crayons for kids as well. End of the review for me is this place seems more of a place suited for peeps minus children and family kinda joint. Kinda a bummer because my kiddo loved your pancakes and syrup!!! And doesn't like any other places."}
{"text":"This restaurant is hard to describe.  The restaurant itself and the menu are really simple, breakfast staples, but they are done so well that they taste better! All ingredients are local and organic.   I always try to do the \"special\", which is usually a type of scramble.  Always delicious!  There are only about 7 tables in the whole place, so I left off a star for the wait you will see on the weekends.  However, it is 100% worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Matt's Butter Burger is THE dish to have here! Matt starts his lunch menu @ 11am. The breakfast here is good don't get me wrong just skip breakfast & go 4 the butter burger. Also make sure u don't park on the empty dirt parking lots in front of & behind Matt's or you'll get a $120.00 ticket! Park on the paved streets/lots only & keep in mind parking is limited."}
{"text":"I could tell the beef was good quality but they could've still added just a little salt and pepper."}
{"text":"Food was great! Had a wonderful breakfast. Highly recommend!!!  Organic and local food. Bacon was so thick and well cooked. The whole grain bread was great, with a homemade jelly. I am a picky eater, but this food was quality!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Hog and Chick breakfast. I order the eggs basted with bacon and home fries.  The bacon was fantastic.  They offer hash browns or home fries with a side of toast.  The home made jelly is wonderful.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Crowded on the weekend, but I'm a fan of breakfast anytime. The food is impeccably delicious, service once seated is friendly and quick, coffee is delicious, and don't miss the homemade jam with your toast. My 12 year old son and I enjoyed our date with bar seating last visit, and he polished off everything on his plate and can't wait to come back. Everyone I've taken here has loved it. Thanks, Matt's!"}
{"text":"There hasn't been a breakfast place as good as this for a while. I loved the local produce, the ambience and the location. It's the best way to go out for breakfast and consider the direction of your upcoming day in a relaxing, yet stimulating environment. The menu will have you coming back again and again, you can't do it all in one sitting. I'm happy to recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast in a warehouse setting. We tried the Belgian waffles and bacon and eggs.  The food was served quickly, was hot and fresh. Service was excellent and the staff was friendly. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Amazing food at a low price. Quality ingredients and awesome service."}
{"text":"It was like we didn't exist. It took around 10 minutes of standing waiting to be seen. We actually watched people come and go behind us because no one was there to greet us. Eventually, somebody came.   The first thing that struct me as odd when we finally got seated was that we could not modify ANYTHING If I wanted a waffle on the side, our waiter said I had to buy another full meal that had the waffle. They wouldn't even give my Mother the option of removing her onions from a meal someone said was optional. Very disappointing.   Aside from that, the food wasn't bad actually. Up until we noticed my Mother had hair in her potatoes. She was only half way finished her food when we informed our waiter. He said he would take it to his manager and return shortly. So while we wait, I search my food like a madman hoping I don't find anything, resulting in me not even wanting to eat anymore. The waiter returned and said that it wasn't hair, it was only a scratch in the plate.   Really...? A scratch that can move and land on other food with a push of a fork? Right  He also returned empty handed. If it was just a scratch in the plate, why didn't he give us the food back? My Mom left not only still hungry, but offended as well. The food didn't take too well to our stomachs either...  Thank you very much, for being terrible. We will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever, anywhere. Farm fresh food. Lightest waffles. Delicious local bread. Unbelievable bacon."}
{"text":"On my recent vacation I learned that Guy Fieri can be trusted with any food decision.   We waited 1.5 hours on a Saturday morning to get in to Matt's, and I would wait longer next time if I had to.   The staff was incredibly friendly and the food was beyond description.   I ordered the Five Spot, a side of Home fries, and a Honey Lemonade.   The Five Spot was a breakfast sandwich featuring a fried egg, thick cut bacon, cheese, and grilled onions. Its possible that there was another element on the sandwich, but I was in taste heaven and didn't stop to consider what the sandwich was made of.... My home fries were thick cut potatoes with lots of grilled onions and large pieces of rosemary. The large pieces allowed for the flavor to permeate, and I was able to pick around them so that it didn't feel that I was chewing on little sticks.   The honey lemonade was so great that I ordered a second glass to-go!   Matt's is small and seats only 25 diners at a time, but it is definitely a flavor powerhouse!   From now on, I will encourage anyone I know traveling to Phoenix to stop by Matt's. It was fantastic."}
{"text":"Yea!  Matt's on Camelback is open.  Same menu, great service, great breakfast.  Enjoyed the new location. It has the same buzz as downtown.  So far, wait isn't quite as long.  Try everything once!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the big deal is about?  The place is always packed so they must have something going on but the two times I've eaten at Matt's the food is bland or borderline bad.  It's breakfast food!  You almost have to go out of your way for it NOT to taste good but Matt's seems to manage."}
{"text":"Nice surprise for airport food. Had breakfast with a few people and everything was very good. Food was hot freshly made and tasty. Fast service and even though there was a line to get in it moved fast. Staff was friendly and hustled to get you on your way. If you in the airport and hungry I. Would recommend you try it. I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Matt's a couple of times now.  There is always a line.  Most recently I went on a Wednesday, which they will tell you is the slowest day,  and the line was shorter that day.  Matt's is small, not in a quaint way, but in a cramped way.  I sat at the counter.  It's impossible to sit comfortably at their counter, because of the lack of leg room, but the other problem is that  they have put one too many chairs at the counter, so I was bumping elbows throughout my meal with my neighbors.  If you go by yourself, they won't let you sit at a table, so you're stuck at their crappy counter.  (don't get me wrong...I normally love to sit at the counter at a restaurant, as you get better and faster service)  One of my meals, the AZ scramble (a special) was pretty solid.  And I like the rosemary homefries.  Other meals (including the salami and eggs) weren't that remarkable.  Matt's won't be my first, second, third choice for breakfast in the valley.  Too much trouble for inconsistent results.  If I want to wait in a line I'll go to Morning Glory Cafe, where the atmosphere is SO much better and the food is better.  If I don't want to wait in a line, there are many other breakfast places that offer good consistent food without a wait."}
{"text":"Awesome toast. Awesome waffles. Awesome coffee. The bacon wasn't crispy, but everything else was so awesome it didn't matter. New, bigger location. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time at the airport in Phoenix, and Matt's is a pleasant surprise and great breakfast for airport restaurants. The staff is friendly, and the decor is bright. If you ever are at Terminal 4, great spot for food and drinks. Plus there are many places to recharge your phones and computers."}
{"text":"No freezer in the joint so when they run out of OJ they have to literally go and buy more oranges!  The food is fresh and homeade.  I haven't been to their newest location which I hear is much larger inside to accomodate the massive breakfast crowds."}
{"text":"Was in town for work. Saw this place on DDD and went on the way to the airport. Awesome food. Had the special- chicken sausage scramble with hash browns. Both excellent. Best meal of my trip here. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Matt's is good and certainly worth doing at least once.  The food is solid to above average even if it is a little pricey for breakfast but not outrageous.    The real draw is the location which is next to the downtown farmers market.  So on Saturday you can hit the market while waiting for your table, buy something to strengthen your locavore cred and then eat at Matt's which is a hip reclaimed location.    Then off to buy some new Steampunk junk.."}
{"text":"This place gets you with the smell because smells really good, but do make sure you have time to wait for your food. A simple sandwich to go it took over 20 minutes. I am just glad I had time to wait for my flight. The staff however is great, very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great brunch but no alcohol!!! In any case I love their midwestern cuts of pork and excellent breakfast flavors. Busy and popular."}
{"text":"Good occasion get some friends together who are virgin Matt's BB goers and we waited about 40 min for our table which ultimately wasn't too bad as we got seated in the private VIP nook at the front of their newly located establishment. The decor was plain and simple and service was top notch as our water was always topped up. I went for brekkie with the hog and chick and hubby did the BLT and our other two friends also went with lunch.   Somehow I remembered that the hashbrowns were better than what I dined on today, there was a slight bitter/sour slant to them and I was a bit put off, perhaps too over buttered for my taste today, however thick cut slice bacon saved the day as usual.   All in all the company was priceless and we will likely stick to eating near our place as it is a trek."}
{"text":"So, it was 7:22 a.m. on the first Saturday of 2008 when we walked into Matt's Big Breakfast.  The place was maybe half full when we were taken to a table for two with a seat on the side.  A friendly waiter came by for drink orders; I went with apple juice but was later informed they were out.  The whole order went a little something like this, 2 coffees, 1 milk, 1 waffle, 1 cakes, and 1 special of ham eggs green chili and cheese scramble.  I hear the coffee was drinkable.  The waffle and pancakes had somewhat of a buckwheat taste but not sure if that is what they actually were.  I am a huge fan of Belgium waffles and found myself terribly disappointed.  I see a Belgium waffle as having a slight crisp of an edge and a soft center.  This waffle was very soft with no crisp and almost like a moist sponge.  The special was not the best and the pancakes seemed pretty heavy.  The home fries seemed like they were cooked in bacon grease and maybe sat there too long.  I did like the small quaint feel of the restaurant.  All of the staff was very friendly and worked together.  People of all styles came for breakfast, there were regulars, people in a hurry for the airport, couples, families, singles, people of all kinds.  They all were all asked, \"How is the food?\"  They all seemed to enjoy.  At the places prime they could probably seat 24 people, give or take.  I will probably not be one of them, but I am glad I was one once."}
{"text":"Amazing. Simply the BEST breakfast place in Phoenix. Always friendly staff, super fast (not the wait to get a table), the highest qualify food. It's refreshing to eat at a restaurant that clearly takes pride in the products they buy, and the flavor of the food they serve.  Every item we've tried has been beyond delicious. The only down side is the usual wait to get a table. They do a great job of being on their game, and serving quickly without making you feel like they are rushing you. This is a MUST try for any breakfast lover. Best advice: get there early, and try the griddle cakes!!!"}
{"text":"Great bacon and pancakes (called griddlecakes), got there at 9:00 on a Saturday morning, had a 30 minute wait in the shade.  Great service and new interior for this location."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great atmosphere, excellent coffee (they have their own house blend of a local coffeemaker) and phenomenal food!!!"}
{"text":"The food is incredible. Most servers were nice but I'm rating a 3 because our server was soooo rude and grumpy."}
{"text":"I don't get the rave reviews or how anybody can claim that this is the \"be all, end all\" for breakfast.    Pros- A friendly server Decent bacon, though heavy on the pepper  Cons- Overpriced for what you get-$7.50 for pancakes a la carte and my personal favorite $1.25 extra charge for more syrup!  With a side of bacon and a coffee that meal alone was $12 before tax & gratuity. 1 slice of toast with a 2 egg breakfast...who does that? 6oz Orange Juice....$2.50! Three in your party, oh I'm sorry you will have to squeeze into the corner with an extra chair because we won't seat you at a table for four is how the visit started!  I understand why everyone claims that it is always so busy, there might be 20 seats in the entire place!  Not going to be back any time soon with all of the other options downtown for breakfast these days."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, just make sure you get there early because it gets packed!"}
{"text":"Ugh!  I thought maybe I should try this place again before I slam it on Yelp, but after reading some of the other one- and two-star reviews, I realize I'm not nuts.  And there is no way I'm going to wait for hours to give this place another chance.  If you want to wait in line for two hours and then receive a cup of grease along with your hash browns and eggs, then Matt's is the place for you.  Disgusting!  Not to mention the bathroom is next door in a hotel room."}
{"text":"Maybe if I'd ordered the full breakfasts that looked so good to me, I would have been happier. But I was hoping to save a few bucks by ordering a cup of coffee and a side order of steak fries. I asked the waitress if the fries were big and she said yes. What I got would have stuffed into my coffee cup, for $4.90. So fries and a cup of coffee and tip cost me nearly $12. For that price I could have ordered a full breakfast. I know airports are supposed to be expensive but that is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I have been going to Matt's over 10 years with my family and love this place. I always order the waffle and bacon....so yummy! If you are looking for a great meal and in downtown Phoenix, you won't be disappointed. It is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a Friday. Waited a hour and a half to be seated, but it was worth the wait.  Breakfast here isn't fancy, just good.  They specialize in fresh pork products. I had the homemade country sausage and eggs. My son had the pork chop and eggs.  Both were very tasty.  We also split an order of griddle cakes.  They were light and fluffy. Overall, a great breakfast establishment, but plan on waiting. I can only imagine how long the wait is on weekends. Kudos to Elena, she does a great job of making sure things run smoothly and that patrons are taken care of."}
{"text":"I was in downtown Phoenix this morning and decided to try this place out.  I have several friends that rave about Matt's and of course they have a good rating on yelp.  At 8am on a Friday this place was packed.  Parking is terrible and they have a guy that makes you move or doesn't allow you to park in other lots so you are forced to find a spot on the street and walk.  The restaurant is smaller and very busy/loud.  They seated us fairly quickly and the service was very good.  The menu option are pretty basic and only have about 10 items listed.  I ordered the cheese omelet with home fries and sourdough toast.  My wife ordered the eggs, hash browns, bacon and sourdough toast.  Food was out within 5 min.  Again, no complaints about service.  The food though was nothing special and certainly not served in HUGE portions like many of the reviews claim.  I found the potatoes to be fine and the omelet to be an omelet (nothing special).  My wife's food looked like scrambled eggs from a buffet and hunk of soggy hash browns (literally where sitting in grease).  I would certainly go to other places (Biscuits, Butterfields..._ than Matt's again.  Unfortunately, there is nothing special about their food and, again, the parking terrible."}
{"text":"Average breakfast and limited menu.  Pancakes were dry.  Waffle was good as was the bacon.  Not sure it is worth the long wait"}
{"text":"I have wanted to visit Matt's for quite some time now. My attempts have always been thwarted due to the extraordinary lines, the lack of time, and a growling stomach. Today, finally, I remedied that situation and finally ate at Matt's.  Is Matt's overhyped? Perhaps. The small venue nearly guarantees a long wait. Is the food worth it? That is always a matter of opinion, but in mine, I think it was. I ordered the pancakes, pancakes that happened to be lightest and fluffiest I have probably ever eaten. For a side, I chose the cranberry walnut toast. It was good, as expected. Toast is hard to mess up unless obviously burnt. The friend who ate with me ordered the special that day, an egg scramble with sausage, havarti, and sweet peppers and rosemary. After sampling a bite, I wish I had ordered the special instead. The pancakes were good, but the special was great.  Will I go back to Matt's? The answer is yes, though realistically it may not happen for a while due to the typical long wait times. Given the fact a wait is common, it might be a nice add to offer free WiFi or free coffee service outside for those waiting."}
{"text":"This place is hands down phenomenal! On vacation from Chicago and decided to try Matt's out. They have this strawberry home made preserve that will make you forget all your worries in life. They also have apple smoked sausage that is sweet and savory! Don't forget to try the hash browns!!! Best ever... crispy on the out side soft on the inside , yet not soggy one bit,with all sorts of flavoring! Not just the plain old hash browns you get elsewhere. Local or not, Matts's is a MUST!!!"}
{"text":"We drove in 11 am Sunday, 6/ 7/15, from east Mesa, 27 miles, for the best breakfast! We waited 20 min to get in, seated at the counter. where we could see into the kitchen, and both had the Chick and Hog breakfast. OMG - bacon to die for, sourdough toast from heaven when the homemade strawberry preserves were slathered on and snappy service. Always a great choice to eat! Mrs. Matt always welcoming you as if we're coming to their home. Now, I need a nap!"}
{"text":"Quick service all around. Amazing food... Sky Harbor has revamped their food choices and I can honestly say this place is up there with Arizona top breakfast places (heard good things about their other locations as well.) Great ok every way.  Oh, and the bacon. The bacon was unbelievable."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  About the restaurant itself.  It's right by downtown Phoenix, and in fact right next to a Light Rail stop--so keep this in mind, parking is metered and sometimes hard to come by easily, if you live by a light rail this may be the smarter option.  The place is seriously tiny, only about 6-8 groups of people can be seated at one time.  A slight drawback is that there is limited outdoor seating, which, given the predictably large lines even on weekdays, is a problem.  The Phoenix sun will make a 45 minute wait seem like an hour and a half wait.  Now about the service.  I've always had a good experience with the people who work here.  The first time I came here, apparently one of the owners saw that I looked lost, because she came out and very kindly explained how people are seated, where I can go to get coffee in the meantime.  She even suggested I leave my cell phone number and she'll call me when my seat is ready, in case I'm shopping for example.  The waitresses always serve us quickly and never leave us hanging, and they're always smiling, which for some reason makes the experience so much better.  Now for the best part.  I swear, they put crack in their food, because although their breakfast options are simple, they are out of this world.  The first time I came here I got the waffles.  Perhaps it's because they use REAL maple syrup, or all of the ingredients are organic and locally grown, but they make the best waffles I've ever had.  I don't even know how one makes a good waffle really, it seems pretty formulaic, but it's stellar.  I ordered it with bacon, which was also wonderful--the bacon used was the good stuff, not the excessively fatty bacon you buy at the supermarket.  Every bite is spectacular, and when you're done, you're full, but not the kind of full you'll often get at breakfast joints where you think you're going to explode or take a nap--full, but refreshed.  The second time I came I got the pancakes.  Not the best pancake I've ever had, but still, superb and the real maple syrup just sends it through the roof.  The third time I went I got the waffle again (see above).  Before I came here, I was excited about leaving Phoenix for New York due to the incredible array of dining options you get in that city.  Now I'm worried there won't be anything as good!"}
{"text":"Huuuge fan of original. Airpirt location not so much. Chik pesto sandwich dry smaller than bun and flavorless. Should have went to mcdonalds. Yuk and im a chef my kids even said yuk"}
{"text":"Just got home from Matts' saw it on Triple D decided to test the light rail and take a trip for breakfast. Sorry to say very disappointed. Although we were seated right away and the service was friendly the food was nothing extraordinary and overpriced. It was good but nothing extraordinary in fact the home fries were exactly what I make at home. Sausage was ok but too spicy for my taste. Hubby said the bacon was nothing to write home about in fact he wanted pancakes but wasn't willing to pay basically $8 for a stack of pancakes. Seating was very uncomfortable in wheelchairs and the noise level was like sitting on the runway at Sky Harbor. Still trying to figure out what all the fuss is about. Plus we're home less than an hour and hubby is hungry again. We won't be back"}
{"text":"Outstanding food.  Get over the wait people.  That's what happens in a desperate-for-culture town like Phoenix gets a few good places to eat.  You think they complain about this in cities that have a soul?   The waffle-outstanding.  Hashbrowns- best ever.  Bacon-great.   Its local, its fresh and its unique."}
{"text":"Cannot overstate what a great experience this was. Gotta start with the food: my griddle cakes were amazing and my wife's waffle was just about as good. Delicious thick slab, peppered bacon was the perfect side. Coffee was not as good as the food (always the conundrum-give up coffee shop quality for better food?), but at least plentiful. Service was beyond friendly, though marred by lacking silverware after our food was served (thankfully, the butter still melted). Probably the best airport dining experience I ever had. Hope our connection next week allows time for a return engagement."}
{"text":"We went at about 9 on a Monday morning, and didn't have to wait in line at all.  I had the Hog & Chick with bacon, hash browns, and sourdough toast.  It was fantastic.  The hash browns were a little crunchier on the outside and softer on the inside than I would have preferred, but overall they were good.  The bacon was different, but in a good way.  It was very thick, not overly crispy, a little sweet, and peppery.  I'm not usually a fan of bacon, but really enjoyed theirs.  The toast was fantastic.  Perfect for: when you want a typical breakfast done better"}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago & there service and food was great. The portion size was big and tasted even better. Very friendly environment. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The meal was great, whole wheat  toast was very tasty with preserves and blueberry  lemonade was thrist quenching!!"}
{"text":"I honestly dont understand what all the rave is about. Chicken sandwich was good. The omelet my husband got was average and pricey. The waitress barely checked on our table and her shorts were so short her butt cheeks were hanging out."}
{"text":"It appears as if my first review of this fine establishment was pushing the envelope a bit, so allow me to reintroduce my opinion of one of my favorite places to dine in this city.   Matt Pool and his breakfast restaurant have received national critical acclaim for their use of local, fresh, organic ingredients and their simple traditional preparation of American breakfast classics.   The number one complaint I encounter about this restaurant is the wait. Of course there's a wait, it's probably the most famous breakfast joint in this state, and there's a reason people flock to it 6 days a week: because its really good food served by a really good staff. I'm sure that the people who complain about the wait here are the same people who complain about the wait at Pizzeria Bianco.   To all of those people, I pose this question to you: since when has dining out in America become this rush to get in, stuff your gullet and get out as fast as possible? Why is dining in this country no longer about the experience and the socialization you get with your fellow diners? Why not come downtown, sign up for a table, and then stroll down to Fair Trade for a latte while you wait, or take a nice walk around and see what the Roosevelt district has to offer? We're always in such a hurry...I say it's nice to slow down, spend some time with our friends and family and nosh on a breakfast that is totally worth the wait. I believe that many restaurants have spoiled the average American consumer with instant gratification--how many times have you refused to wait at a restaurant because the wait was 30+ minutes? We want good food, and we want it now, screw everyone else, and if you can't feed our bellies within 30 minutes, we'll take our business somewhere else. This attitude is crap.   You have to slow down and appreciate how hard this little restaurant works. Matt's wife is there 6 days a week to ensure that their business is performing at the level at which it should. The kitchen staff is there from 6:00 am to almost 4pm sometimes churning out thousands of plates of fried eggs, thick peppered bacon, hash browns, home fries, pancakes, pork chops, burgers...The point is, a lot of love and thought has gone into this restaurant to make sure that every single ingredient put on your plate is of the highest quality possible and is prepared by a very talented kitchen staff.   It is a small restaurant, but it's always warm and inviting, and the coffee is always hot and fresh and they might not serve you a huge glass of orange juice, but it's always 100% fresh, squeezed that morning by the staff.   After my plea to try and understand the other side of this restaurant, I know that I may not have been able to make everyone stop and reconsider any opinions they might have about this place: the wait, the small serving of orange juice, the confined areas, and that's OK. All I'm saying is that this place is an institution in downtown dining...and it's really nice to go an experience the food, the service and the though that goes into running this business if only every once in a blue moon. And if not, that's OK, because there are plenty of people who will gladly take your place in line."}
{"text":"Went to matt's the other day to see what the rave is about and just as I expected nothing but self perpetuated hype with the help of the food network nothing more. The service was ok the coffee nothing special and my hog and chick was very unremarkable at best. It was not that the food was bad, however, if you can't be seated right away it's not worth the wait. This is not a special place. No gem to find her just pricey breakfast food and there are other choices that you can do better with. I saw a guy paying for his breakfast using three different credit cards....I mean what did he eat? And how much did it cost!!!!?? Anyway, if you are into over hyped breakfast joints and food that is mediocre at best then you may like matt's. Nothing against them but you guys are not all that when it comes to what you serve and your 15 minutes of fame has long been expired. Making people wait to eat here is nothing more then for show..trust me this is my review and I was seated right away just imagine if I had to wait in line what the review would say. Save your money and look elsewhere for the start of your day. I give matt's 5 stars for boring me with their breakfast and coffee and I give them another 5 stars for being able to convince people to pay over five dollars for a lacluster breakfast which amounts to culinary rape of one's taste buds. Do yourself a favor when you pass by this  place and your hungry just drive past and go to any other nearby spot that won't   Molest your good senses.  To make it you have to rely on your food and staff........not guy fieti and the food network!"}
{"text":"Good food for a reasonable price, especially for airport food.  And the fact that they have some local craft beer only adds. Highly recommend if you are stuck in the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"Really good breakfasts. Our waiter, Michael was hilarious and upbeat. He made the whole meal fun. The food was very good. I'd eat here if it was outside the airport. It's obviously more expensive than an outside restaurant, but even taking that into consideration, very good food. It cost us about $50 for four to eat breakfast. A normal breakfast enter is too big. It would be safe to order one breakfast and split it."}
{"text":"The place is tiny, you have to wait at list 30 minutes to the taste the most expensive small oj and very greasy breakfast! although their bacon is pretty tasty. I wish they wouldn't rush you so much."}
{"text":"I work in the area so tried a carry out from this location.  Horrible.  They give no priority to carryout and this is really not much of a waiting area.  I waited for 20 minutes just standing there in the way of everyone else and the bathrooms.  Finally the food comes up.  I just don't think this type of food holds up well to carryout and they use cardboard containers which just dont' work well either.  I thought the food was just plain gross and my toast was actually as black as asphalt.  Who would put that in there and think it was okay.  Those homemade preserves are running and disgusting and not a fan of their homemade ketchup??  I think i like Denny's better.  The parking is awkward here also, you are goign to have to go in the garage and get a ticket, hopefully you get out without issue.  Lots of people have problems."}
{"text":"Gosh, we love this place but not at this location. Slow service and terrible food. We nearly missed our flight to bring breakfast on board. The burrito was filled primarily with potatoes. I don't mind spending money at the airport for a good drink and grub, but our $60 dollar tab was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"At first glance of the menu, I was put off by the prices and basic menu selections.  The long wait times suck too, but be patient because it's worth it. The food here is very good.   The locally made raisin bread there is excellent! The sausage is fantastic, too. The coffee was delicious. It reminded me of Seattle's. Generous helpings of home fried potatoes, great pork chops perfectly seasoned with rosemary.   The service here is excellent.  The wait staff is a well oiled machine and they move the waiting crowd in front with very swift precision.  Its a little on the expensive side, but if you're craving something a little extra and are patient for the long wait to be seated, this place is worth it."}
{"text":"When I saw that Matt's had four stars on here, I was anticipating something pretty great. After eating there, I felt duped. I waited for almost an hour to find that there were only eight things on the whole menu, and none of them were worth the wait or the price. I got the special of the day and it was, kindly put, less than special. The omelet was cold, bland, and nearly empty of filling and flavor. My boyfriend had the cold and dry pork with less-than-thrilling eggs. The only saving grace was the strawberry jam, but when jam is your only redeeming factor, you've got some work to do. After trying to power through this underwhelming meal, I got the check and thought \"THIS is what they think that food was worth?\" I entirely regret my decision to go to Matt's. I felt deceived by the four star review and felt like my fellow Yelpers deserve more honesty than that.  However, since then, I had the pleasure of going to Mark's Cafe in Tempe (at Rural and Guadalupe) and had an absolutely incredible experience. Rather than wasting your time and money at Matt's, I suggest going to Mark's. Great food, great price, great selection, great service,... Take your money to a breakfast spot that will earn it."}
{"text":"Really wish I could give this 3.5 stars, but system won't let me.  Ate here last week while on a layover.  Could not pass up trying the Bloody Mary (even though I don't actually like vodka) once I saw the bacon!  The cheese was a little weird, not gonna lie.  Also had the enormous Reuben sandwich, which was really delicious.  Service was great, friendly, food was plentiful, and the atmosphere was comforting.  Would definitely eat here again if given the chance."}
{"text":"This may sound strange but I've never actually had breakfast at Matt's Big Breakfast, only lunch. In my opinion they have one of the best burger's in town. My only criticism is that the side is potato chips. But I love the burger. My friend gets the ruben and he says its one of the best he's ever had. The service is always great there too."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, food is as good as their original downtown location. I've been to the other locations dozens of times and almost always get the daily special.  Cool fresh inviting design surrounded by the new State Farm campus.  Didn't have a wait today but that probably won't last once the word gets out."}
{"text":"If you have time during your layover for more than grab and go, this is a nice little place to grab some breakfast. I had Matt's Big Breakfast. Three eggs, bacon, sausage, pancake, and potatoes. Everything was delicious! Thanks Matt for allowing me to eat your breakfast!"}
{"text":"Schrieners chicken enchilada sausage and eggs are amazing!  Waffles are incredible and portions are really big.  I am a breakfast buff and I'm really impressed with the great food and fast service!  Can't wait to come back soon."}
{"text":"I hate complaining but this place is highly overrated. The place is small and the food is just okay. I had the waffle, some bacon, eggs, and hash browns. Nothing to write home about.. just review. Haha"}
{"text":"Came here on our way out of town back to Tucson. Great breakfast. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite being seasoned with rosemary. My husband had the Hog and Chick and really enjoyed the bacon. I had the Monday special of Green Chile Heuvos Rancheros and it was great. Would definitely come back when we are in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"After all the hype this was an overpriced disappointment. I orderd the griddlecakes with milk and coffee to drink. I also ordered a side of bacon as several reviewers recommended it. Including tax but not tip my total for breakfast was $16.01.    The pancakes tasted like Bisquik and the bacon was crispy black and looked and tasted like the cheap grocery store bacon you buy in the shrink-wrap packages. Even funnier the \"three pieces\" were actuallly only 1/2 pieces of bacon at around 4\" long. Overall I've had much better breakfasts at The Good Egg and First Watch at a lower price.   Another disappointment was waiting for me in the parking lot. An employee had parked her white Volvo behind my car and blocked me in. I first waited for her to finish unloading the car, assuming she would move the car after she was done. Instead she came out once more, closed the the trunk and went back inside. I had to go back inside and ask her to move.  The employee did finally move her car but she didn't bother to apologize."}
{"text":"What a great place - small funky and right on time. I love this place - its old school charm with your mama's kind of cooking - huge portions, excellent food - sloppy joes - no way - WAY!  Not fancy - but I love the tight quaint atmosphere - reminds me of a neighbor joint in Chicago. Try it - you'll lie it! Historic area of the Phoenix Downtown area. Very reasonable - and REAL food!"}
{"text":"Long wait but amazing food!!! The five spot sandwich, hash browns, and bacon was the best!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!!!   I love breakfast places and have been to many great ones all over the USA, but I think this is the best one I have visited. While staying Sheraton a couple blocks away, for a work trip, I woke up early to be at the front door at the 6:30am opening.  -Great food (large portions and fresh ingredients) -Best bacon I have ever had -Friendly Staff and excellent service -Small venue -Long wait if you don't arrive early (If you come solo wait is much shorter)  If I ever get back to Phoenix I will be go straight to Matt's!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. Great atmosphere. Omelet was so good. Service was efficient, and friendly. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place and if I lived closer I would come here every day. I've had breakfast twice here with my boyfriend. I so want to branch out my order but both times I ordered the Hog and Chick with bacon and hashbrowns. Thick-cut, delicious peppered bacon and crispy on top, soft in the middle hashbrowns, what more could you want? The thick slices of toast with jam are a really nice touch and the honey lemonade is to die for. My boyfriend always gets the Five Spot breakfast sandwich that has eggs, bacon, onions and cheese on a fresh roll. De-lish! Next time we go I plan on trying the pancakes, I always eye them enviously when I'm there.  When you get there, simply put your name on the list and the number in your party. The pad is usually on top of the water cooler by the door. Then grab a seat in the shade if you can find one and wait anxiously for your name to be called. Don't let the wait detour you, it's completely worth it. Now that it's cooling down the wait won't be so unbearable, especially if you're like me and want your weekend brunch around 1. (I've waited about 30 mins on average)  The restaurant is small and there are only a few tables but it doesn't feel crowded. The staff is super friendly and quick with your orders. You can usually hear some good tunes coming out of the kitchen. The prices are beyond reasonable for the quality of food that you get.  You will leave full, happy and extremely satisfied."}
{"text":"It took us forever to finally get our butts in seats at MBB because frankly we aren't early risers and it gets crowded. Well, we should dragged our butts out of bed! The food was great and well priced. I have always wanted to try their waffle but also felt like having an omelet and potatoes. So I had my omelet and potatoes and my fiancee got the waffle. Best of both worlds! The service was good, the ambiance is friendly, parking is easy. It's a great local spot, the kind that you take visitors to...if you can get out of bed. And you should. I have other things on the menu I need to try!"}
{"text":"Always packed!  Service - This hurts in the service department. Sorry. I just never feel important to the waitstaff.  Food - Well... it's a big breakfast... As Advertised!  Notes: Did i mention that it's always packed?!"}
{"text":"Not as long a wait as I was expecting.  Great service and the Griddle cakes were great. I would definitely came back, when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Matts Big Breakfast is our go-to breakfast spot! We love the amazing service and the food, which is always consistently delicious! As a private chef I will only eat high quality of food, And in their Tempe location even the parking is great. As a private chef, I only eat at high quality restaurants and that's why I eat at Matts Big Breakfast"}
{"text":"The owners of this establishment will go above and beyond to make sure that the people who visit their restaurant eat healthily and are always satisfied."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here during our trip to Phoenix because the restaurant was featured on triple D. The food was amazing, the jalapenos in the eggs were fresh (a rare treat for a michigander) and the chorizo was spicy. The best part though was the rosemary potatoes! perfectly crispy and they did not skimp on the rosemary."}
{"text":"Another breakfast in the books, thanks in part to yelp and the devoted food review culture. Upon arrivng at Matt's Big Breakfast, the line is insanely intimidating. If we weren't so far out of Scottsdale, I'm not sure my girlfriend and I would have withstood the wait. Boy were we happy with our decision to stay. The wait lasted about 45 minutes and we were in and out of the restaurant in about a half hour. I ordered the Five Spot sandwich and my beautiful girlfriend ordered the pork chop meal. We both had water with our meals and the total cost was $19.06. The wait staff is fairly attentive, nice, and very efficient. Unfortunately, we buffered the wait with coffee drinks from Royal at the Market coffee, located just down the street, and they told us at Matt's that outside drinks are not allowed which kinda sucked being that we just waited for 45 minutes in the hot sun. At this point, our expectations were very high and we were a little irritated by the wait, therefore the food had to deliver BIG...and it pretty much did. My sandwich was on a great brioche bun that was loaded with cheese, sunny side up egg, and two great slices of bacon. I also ordered a side of homefries which were perfectly seasoned with herbs and grilled onions. We both agreed the homefries rocked. My grilfriends pork chop was fried and came with this interesting light basil pesto shmear that was perfect. Her eggs were scrambled and the hash brown potatoes were more like a potatoe pancake and she liked it. Her dish also came with local sourdough toast and a great mixed berry jam. Nothing in this meal was cooked bad or served cold. We will probably return again as long as the temperature outside permits. One last FYI: Beware showing up in large groups."}
{"text":"yummy yummy.  I love Matt's big breakfast, and return frequently.  I never mind the wait the staff is amazing and courteous.  The food is fresh and delicious and rotating specials allow you to try different things from their menu.  I am a huge fan :)"}
{"text":"Went to Matt's after checking on Yelp when we landed at Phoenix airport.  It seemed like a nice place to eat based on the reviews. The restaurant is very small and located on an unassuming street corner just south of downtown.  Free parking is difficult to find so bring change for parking meters that are in abundance.  We arrived at around 9 in the morning and it was already warm, and yes there is a wait outside.  There is also not much shade other than a couple of umbrellas and the overhang.  I can't imagine really long waits.  By the way, don't go inside to sign up.  You put your name on a note pad outside of the door and they'll come out to get you when it is your turn.  Our wait on an off-day was about 15-20 minutes.  (Update:  Looks like they have moved).  The room for us inside was counter-seating next to the register.  It was a tad bit cramped and we didn't have a lot of space to wiggle since we were dealing with servers passing by us constantly.  The service was attentive and pleasant.  All the servers seemed like they were college co-eds but they did not lack any kind of customer service quality.  They buzzed around with purpose and had no problems with menus, rude customers, or getting around the cramped quarters of the establishment.    The food is excellent.  We shared a three egg omelet with chicken apple sausage and local hot peppers that was one of the best I've tasted.  The pancakes were fluffy and delicious, and the side of pepper bacon complemented everything perfectly.  The star of the meal is the home fries; an amalgamation of potatoes, buttery goodness, and rosemary.  They are scrumptious beyond belief.    Overall the experience at Matt's was excellent, and maybe the new building will allow for better parking and less wait time.  And while the food was outstanding, the conditions for waiting, the parking, and the cramped spaces inside only warrant 4 stars."}
{"text":"My boss brought us here for breakfast and it was excellent! The food was great, service was impeccable and the wait was not too bad. They advised us the wait would be 15 minutes but we were seated in about 5 minutes. The portions were large and definitely got out money's worth. I plan on going back again."}
{"text":"Went here after seeing it on DDD. The waffle and bacon were amazing! Got there right before the rush (Sat around 8am) so we didn't have to wait. They don't have tables big enough for 4 (it's a smallllll place) so we sat at the counter. Everyone's food was great. ONLY problem was for some reason, the waitress refused to give my husband water. I say \"refused\" because it turned into a joke but he asked her like 4x and still didn't get water."}
{"text":"Been on my list since I saw it on tripD and stopped in both times going through Phx, was pleasantly surprised and happy with the service and the food. If your in Skyharbor you should try it!"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast this morning and it was great. Friendly staff, delicious food. Only negative is that it's really loud. Otherwise, it was awesome!"}
{"text":"A shining beacon of mediocrity.  Pros - it is a restaurant.  They serve food.  That food is okay.  Cons - despite ample room, the outdoor seating was closed because (I shit you not) hostile pigeons had overrun the courtyard.  Also, the drinks were over priced and watered down.  Finally, service was by and large quite slow.  It wasnt bad, but nothing stood out.  It simply was."}
{"text":"I'm pretty forgiving my nature but you've got to be kidding me when I just watched my tuna salad sandwich and coleslaw sit under the heat lamp for over 40 minutes, and then it was served to me.   At least I was charged full price after pointing this out and not eating my wilted hot sandwich and slaw.   Too tired to be an ass  over it so I just got the hell out of there.... Jeebus"}
{"text":"I had to see what all the hype was about. We weren't about to wait in line, so we ordered take out. It was an average breakfast, good but nothing to be impressed by or wait in line for."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Came here on vacation and it was worth every penny.   B-Rabbit Approved!!"}
{"text":"After a long night shift at work, bf and I decided to try this place, with all the great reviews, how can you go wrong?! Looking at the menu for a bit, I decided on the Pork chop and eggs. This is where I went wrong, I was extremely disappointed. For starters, I'm super happy it came out so quickly, but at the same time, that tells me it was cooked ahead of time-huge turn off. So I get my breakfast and was immediately turned off, my \"Iowa cut\" pork chop was about 1/3 the size of an Iowa cut chop. (Yes, I do realize that I am in Arizona, but I expect to get what I'm told I'm getting!) Next thing that caught my attention was the green color! I about sent it back, not sure what the green paste on it was, but it didn't taste as bad as it looked. Ok, as you can tell, I was very irritated with the pork, but moving on. Potatoes had too much Rosemary, I figured home fries were simply home fries, they were a sad example. Half of them were stale, the other half were mush. Eggs were done as asked, very happy with that. The toast and homemade Jam were awesome, but again, the bread was a bit stale...   The only reason that I didn't give this place one star, was my bf plate. He had the waffle with bacon and a side of sausage, simply AMAZING! Really wished I had followed my intuition and ordered that too!  Staff was very friendly and alert, made you feel like a home town type feel, however, I felt bombarded. Every time he took a drink of his coffee, we put our fork down, or even took a look around, they were at our table. I felt rushed and didn't appreciate the feeling much, they weren't busy, and had plenty of open tables...   Will try again, but certainly won't go back for the pork chops!!"}
{"text":"FRESHEST ORANGE JUICE EVER.  How many places have you been to where someone writes about the toast? Even the big fatty piece of toast we got was incredible.  Only had to wait about 15 minutes on a really busy Tuesday (yes, really busy Tuesday) morning.   Weird quick tip to add: if you are seated on the stools, you kind of slide off if you don't sit back far enough."}
{"text":"Matt's was certainly enjoyable (all locally grown organic for my BIGGEST bfast-love the peppered bacon) and Michael (server) was a treat. This world needs more of his spirit, especially in this profession.  Keep smiling!"}
{"text":"Came here and just ordered a drink, but the service was so quick and friendly. The staff was very helpful, and all of the people around me who ordered food - it looked delicious. It's hard to find good airport food, but this place uses fresh ingredients and actually seems to care instead of the usual apathetic fare. The lady next to me was being really difficult and making a custom sandwich, and the bartender was so accommodating. Next time I am in terminal 4 gate b I will definitely come back here! My only complaint is I wish they were open longer!"}
{"text":"I was kind of surprised about the small menu since I have heard a lot of hype about this place. I was happy to see the words \"cage-free\" and \"organic\" throughout the menu. We tried the Thursday special- Eggs Benedict, a side order of bourbon cherry sausage, a side of bacon, and a stack of griddle cakes. All of the meats were awesome, especially the sausage! The griddle cakes were not bad, they tasted like maybe they used corn flour in addition to the standard pancakes you get everywhere. The prices are higher than your average breakfast joint, but it comes with the quality of the product, so I think they were fair for the organic options.  There is just not really any reason to go back since we tried almost the whole menu... I'm not embellishing on the small menu part!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast for the church crowd.   Would give them 5 stars but no alcohol at brunch. We are in Mimosa and Bloody Mary country!! Get with the program LOL."}
{"text":"I don't like the service here. The food is so-so. To many young girls working here with NO clue about service. Food We think is way better Dennis because the prices are way better."}
{"text":"Ordered a Cheese Omelet to go. After 35 min. went to counter to inquire how much longer. Cashiers came back saying she didn't know what happened to order. I requested a refund as I was going to be late for flight. Manager showed up 8 minutes later, to inform me she had to issue refund through my e-mail. No apology was given and still have not received a refund!"}
{"text":"These guys have it nailed, the breakfast is \"of Champions\". The fresh blueberry jam that comes with the killer fresh toast is so good I could eat it off the floor. (and possibly did cause I dropped some off my knife :). The only reason that I give them 4 instead of 5 stars is that WE GET IT you are small, you're hipster, you're non commercial...but for the love of Pete make the place a little bigger, so more than 3 people can eat inside at a time and we don't have to go on a wait EVERY time we come. But the quality is awesome."}
{"text":"Matt's big breakfast is a nice treat on mornings I don't feel like cooking! Its close enough to ride our bikes which we love. While taste and food quality is much better than typical chain restaurants, its nothing I can't prepare in my own kitchen. That said, the fresh squeezed orange juice is amazing! I will go to Matt's just for that!!!! My husband and I joke that it is a version of Village Inn for a younger and health conscious generation. We will continue to return as long as we live here!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, eggs were running, not a good variety on the menu. Waited about 45 minutes for Terrible service and a breakfast that tasted awful."}
{"text":"We got to Matt's on a Sunday afternoon and only waited about 15 minutes! Hooray, what a good start to what I hoped would be the best breakfast/brunch experience I've had in my 7 years in Phx! The service was outstanding, too!   My fiancé got the Salami Scramble and I got the Chick and Chop. Maybe it's because I grew up in the south where food like this is pretty standard, but I really didn't taste anything special about the breakfast, even though I really wanted to have the \"foodgasm\" that so many others here claim. The hashbrowns were good, but very, very greasy, and my porkchop was overcooked and very dried out, and was completely overpowered by Rosemary, which I typically love.   My highest compliments go to the honey lemonade, the berry preserves we were given for the thick sourdough bread, and, of course, the waitstaff! Overall, I think the place is overhyped, much like Pizzeria Bianco, but worth a shot for the experience.  I personally would have felt robbed had I waited more than 15 minutes and gotten food that just made me go \"eh.\""}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've ever had. They say on their menu that they try to buy local, and fresh and make straightforward dishes, and it definitely is a winning combination.   Service is a bit chaotic (they use a bit of a team approach), but attentive and effective.   The place is also a great value; they serve a lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"Loved the bacon and griddle cakes.  My boyfriend cosigns the bacon review and loved the hash browns."}
{"text":"I was in phoenix on business and im allways looking for some good eats , I found this place with the help of yelp and food network app on my i phone .  I originally planned on getting the waffle that everyone raved about , but ended up getting the Special Andouille sausage scramble ( spicy!) but very good . Hash Browns were good and i also liked the sour dough toast .  When i go back im definatly gonna try the waffle  Be ready to wait for a seat , it doesnt seem very big .  Singles get seated faster because they have counter style seating"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to have flown out of the US airways terminal and I'm so glad we did because this place is THE PLACE for breakfast within an airport. I've heard of the downtown location so i was eager once I spotted this bad boy.   I got the waffle which came with bacon.. The perfect combo for sweet and savory. The spices they use for the bacon separate this place from any other breakfast joint. I would come back here in a heart beat.  I might to stop at the downtown one more often now!"}
{"text":"Living in Carefree, we don't get downtown Phoenix very often.  When we do, it is a MUST to have breakfast at Matt's.  It may be a hole-in-the-wall, but it is a great hole-in-the-wall!"}
{"text":"Look up deeeelicious and you'll find eggs, bacon and potatoes by Matt!  Love the locations and love the staff.   Job well done, friends!!! :)"}
{"text":"The food here is reminiscent of a standard American breakfast diner. It's clean, service was good, and the food was hot. The home fries were, unintentionally, the star of the show. There wasn't a whole lot aside from the decor that sets this diner aside from others."}
{"text":"An hour and a half wait...I thought after seeing this on DDD (from the Food Network) that it has to be pretty darn good considering how they raved about it. Was wrong to believe them. It was normal breakfast food that just tasted fresher than what you could eat at Denny's. Not sure why people are obsessed with it. I guess for that long of a wait you expect very yummy food and it was a let down."}
{"text":"I ordered the BBQ chicken dinner and got a tiny piece of chicken that was totally dry. The waiter was embarrassed and gave me another piece so I gave this place two stars instead of one. Five stars for my waiter zero stars for the food."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast ever!!!!! Try the pancakes or \"griddlecakes\"- they won't fail! Sweet and tasty!!"}
{"text":"Way overrated!!!!  1st off, u sit down and they'll have ur food to u in 2 minutes!!!! People start watching and u start to feel pressure to hurry up.  They want u in and out so they can take in new customers.  It was very odd! I couldn't even enjoy a cup of coffee. The food was below average and I mean it!! Denny's is just as good for 1/2 the price.  I got 2 eggs, greasy potatoes, bacon and toast for $12.50.  I don't mind paying or a hearty breakfast but this was far from it! I'll never be back"}
{"text":"The menu is pretty lameski if you don't go in for a lot of meat.  Here's my problem with Matt's: if you order the cheese omelet and have their paltry selection of veggies added to it, you're paying more than you would for a meat omelet.  That's pretty stupid; meat costs more than vegetables, and is a bigger deal to store and prep.  How hard is it to offer a reasonable vegetarian option?    I've eaten there twice for breakfast and lunch, and quality each time was middling.  The hashbrowns were not good, really slimy and squishy on the inside.    Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast is a nice, quaint little breakfast joint that does breakfast very well. A friend and I came here this morning and we were very much pleased with the food, the atmosphere, and the service.  We both ordered the day's special. It was a apple sausage scramble with spinach, a helping of hash browns, and some toast. Everything about the dish was very well done. The eggs were scrambled just right so that they were buttery, a lil creamy, and very fluffy. The apple sausage was just alright. It wasn't bursting with flavor and could've used a lil more heat or smokiness or something.   The hash browns are worth raving about though. The top layer of hash browns were crazy crispy which is always a good thing. But beneath the crust were some great gooey gluey but not soggy potatoes that perfectly complimented the crisp of the outside. The crisp:gooey ratio was flawless!  Even the toast was fantastic. Went with sourdough. Always do and forever will. The jam was made with fresh berries. The toast was thick and well-buttered. Went great with the freshly made jam.  All-in-all it was a good breakfast experience. It wasn't the best breakfast in the world. It wasn't super phenomenal or mind-blowing. But it was certainly above average so I'll give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is now my #1 breakfast spot in AZ! So delish and my waitress, Janiel, was awesome. She made recommendations and was spot on with her description. The pork chop was juicy and not over salted. I got pepper jack cheese on my hash browns which were actually brown. I am going to frequent this place. Great food, great service, and great vibe. Staff was laughing and joking around which tells me they have fun while working there! Thanks for a great experience Matt's Big Breakfast of Tempe. Keep it up peeps. Highly recommended you visit THIS location!!!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE breakfast restaurant of all time! This food Is just the best food ever. Their waffles and pancakes are like nothing you have ever tasted before, they literally melt in your mouth when soaked with their home made syrup! Best home fries that I have ever tasted, so full of flavor and the rosemary gives them a unique flavor. You can really tell that the owners really know about breakfast/lunch and that they care about the quality of the food. I highly HIGHLY recommend this restaurant. The wait time can be long but definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Stick with the basics because they are done so perfectly you'll never find better. Breakfast time can get busy if you're later in the day but come early and it's still mellow. The bacon is superb, eggs done perfectly, and tasty potatoes. We've been many times and they never fail to cook everything perfectly. The quality of the ingredients really shows thru."}
{"text":"I'm probably the lone dissenter in the land of Five star reviews here, but here goes.   I wanted to love Matt's. It's adorable and close to home.   I don't eat pork, which eliminated a good portion of the menu right off the bat. That's fine, it's not like I expect restaurants to cater to me, that's what my kitchen is for.   I had the cheese omelet. It was good, but could have used some spices. The hash browns were ok, despite the fact that they were floating in their own grease.   Matt's is great if you like breakfast with a bucket of grease on the side. It made me sick, so I won't be back."}
{"text":"While the food tasted OK, it was served completely cold. The server must have gotten distracted because we were one of the first people in the restaurant when it opened early in the morning. We waited longer than we should have for the food to come, while people that came after us we're being served in half the time. Also, we asked if we could substitute one pancake in place of home fries and toast, and we were told that we would have to pay $4.50. Crazy! After flying all night, we were really looking forward to a great breakfast. We would not dine here again."}
{"text":"Love this place. I went there for the first time this morning. It was outstanding. When we where told the wait was over an hour we debated not staying. I am so glad we did. Totally worth it.   Everything was cooked perfect. The homemade bread with preserves was awesome. I got the hashbrowns which where great. So much butter which I know is bad for you but if you are coming here for breakfast I doubt health food is what you are looking for. My girlfriend got the home fries which where actually better.   Just the best breakfast in town period. Go there and wait it out. So worth it."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, fresh food. Wonderful, friendly, on the ball staff.  My wishes for this place are:   They would put an awning and some misters outside for while you are enduring the long wait. The sun was beating down on us and we almost left as we had our 6 year old....it was getting to be a bit much. Easily rectified with some more shade and misters. I'm guessing they don't bother as they get enough business even without them.  As vegetarians, when we get something without meat, and don't sub it for something else, I always wish the price would be adjusted slightly. Wishful thinking in most places, I know.  Open something in Laveen Matt. :)"}
{"text":"So I'm heading out to California and I decide to \"load up\" before I hit the road. I've been wanting to try Matt's ever since I moved here last year. So, I get up early to try to get a head start on traffic and lo and behold, traffic. I finally get there after a few wrong turns (Thanks stupid GPS, you're going back from whence you came). I sidle up to the bar and now the decicsion begins. Eggs? Omelette? Cakes? Cakes it is and a side of bacon. While I wait with my cup of coffee, which wasn't half bad, I take in the smallness of this place. Glad I got there early. The GriddleCakes arrive with the bacon. The sweet cream they use makes other places cakes seem like toast. Rich and fluffy with the melting butter on top and real maple syrup, Wooo! The bacon was nice. Cooked to where it wasn't too crispy or too rubbery. And with pepper. Now I just hope I don't fall asleep during my drive. Oh, and what's with the metered parking. I put my .60 in the meter which should have given me an hour and I go out to my car 45 minute later and the meter says expired. What?"}
{"text":"DO NOT MISS Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix. Here's the deal, saddle up to the breakfast bar & get set for a terrific breakfast, served by FUN, attractive servers. Matt only seats about 35 customers, so be patient, you'll be rewarded. If you have some flexibility, stop in around 9:15 AM Monday thru Thursday, often times you can get seated with no waiting. A local favorite & well known throughout Phoenix...FUN !!"}
{"text":"Get the home fries get the home fries get the home fries.  How I never heard of this place before is beyond me. Found it by accident over the weekend and have never been so happy.  Ive been looking for a good greasy spoon breakfast place since i moved here and this place is great.  Its small, there will be a line, but its so worth it.  I got the 5 spot (SUPER thick bacon, REAL eggs, onions, cheese on a roll) and my boyfriend got the griddlecakes, it was delicious.  The waitresses were nice, the place was clean which i imagine is a chore considering the cramped quarters, and the food is just awesome.  Its casual, you should show up early, and 2 people can eat very well for under 20 bucks."}
{"text":"The new location does add a lot more room! But the old house I preferred, even if it meant an hour wait. I always walked else where and got a coffee to pass the time. Kudos to the cereal, though a tad pricey, but they do not slack off on portion sizes for the dishes. Worthy of a side note, order the bacon! (unless you do not eat meat)"}
{"text":"Food was decent....wait was long...service was great! When we arrived we were told it was going to be a 45 minute wait. We really waited 30 minutes. The wait staff is plentiful and are very friendly and helpful. The food was brought quickly and was correct as ordered. The waitresses asked several times if we were doing okay and refilled our drinks promptly.  Will return!!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down amazing! First time there and I will definitely be coming back. :) friendly staff, fast service and very comfortable setting. Their menu is simple which I loved! Their ingredients are top ingredients. Don't even know where to start..... My absolute fav was the waffles! So amazingly tasty! Their home fries are so delicious. My dish came with toast so I got wheat toast, it was so delicious and it comes with butter and jelly theee best!! And to top it off the bacon is oh so yummy ;) Wish they had a location in the LA area. Love this spot!"}
{"text":"OK, maybe I was a bit premature giving a rating after one visit.  Went back the next day.  Got there before 8.  Place was nearly empty.  Ordered hog and chick.  Not nearly as good as previous.  Bacon was burned and hash browns were greasy and dark brown.  Needed a knife to cut a piece out.  Servers and cooks spent much time chatting.  On my first visit the place was packed, but food and service were excellent.  Maybe they work better under pressure?"}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food at reasonable prices! Ate here on a late Saturday morning after a 45 min wait. It was worth it! Although they have plenty of waiting room, my co-diner and I combed the area for neat shops and street art! Great start to our day!  The only thing I didn't like was that they charge for extras like another small (1/2 cup) cup of syrup for my three thick griddle cakes.  Overall I enjoyed it and my date was impressed so I would go again just - no griddle cakes for me."}
{"text":"Yummy hidden gem in downtown Phoenix, though since Food Network has been there, the place has exploded. This is a tiny converted house and boy is it small. The inside is cute though and there are tables packed in along with a counter top bar.  The wait is long, and it is also worth it. The best days to go of course are the weekdays. Just avoid the weekend period. Local eggs, cheeses and milk. Local goods in general. The coffee was to die for! Home made jam! Thick cut delicious BACON! Do stop here."}
{"text":"LOVE the new location. It is always delicious, but the new building is much more spacious and can move a lot more customers. It still has the same vibe as the old place, just bigger!"}
{"text":"Coming from busy Los Angeles, California, this place is stellar in the mellow neighborhood of Arizona. A little mom n pop breakfast house. Little in size but big in name where I had to wait for 45 minutes. Yes!! just for a plate of breakfast.   Friend and I got the pesto pork chop and the hash brown ham combination. Hands down best hash brown ever! Crispy on the outside but savory sweet potatoes on the inside. Eggs were huge and had a very sweet yolk...organic maybe.   Overall was just very satisfying for a simple American breakfast. Nothing fancy but premium ingredients for solid goodness. Honestly best hash brown  and home fried potatoes I've had thus far. Caramelized and seasoned to perfection. I can really eat potatoes every day if this place was around town.  Street parking but it's not bad at all on a weekend. I'm glad I was able to swing by on my visit here. Definitely must try if you're close in town."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast is a place that I try to get to multiple times a month.  To put it simply... it is amazing.  I am not a big breakfast person, but I would gladly make time to get over there for some food when I can.  The Eggs Benedict and most of the specials are great!  I typically choose hash browns over home fries, as the hash browns are a little lighter, but both are quite tasty.  Most people overlook the lunch items on the menu, they are just as good as the breakfast items.  The pesto chicken sandwich and the big butter burger are quite delicious.  What else to say... The staff is very friendly and attentive. I have never had a bad experience there and it is well worth the wait if you have the time.  Oh and do yourself a favor... make sure to get some Bacon (unless you don't eat bacon)."}
{"text":"The wait was REALLY long, but we were prepared by the other reviews. I like that you give your order before you go in so you get your food right away. However, the food is only a step above other, more convenient places. I'm over it."}
{"text":"While I'm giving this 5 stars, I do understand the 3 star reviews. The menu is basic, and the food is fairly basic too. However, I'm giving 5 stars because everything they do, they do right and if you order the right items they can be uniquely delicious. I'll run through my usual order of the Hog and Chick. There are a few options.  The way I get it is with eggs over easy, home fries, bacon, and sourdough bread.   I'll start out with the bacon. Even if you've had a lot of bacon in your life, you've probably never had bacon like this. It's on a whole new level. Don't even think about not ordering bacon. It's somewhat caramelized and peppered at the same time, but not sweet, more pepper flavored. It's hard to explain. Nothing about it is overbearing. They always seem to cook it just right too.  The eggs are eggs, and they aren't done up any differently than you'd expect from over easy eggs however I would say out of the 5 times or so I've been here, they have been cooked perfectly each time with a liquid yolk.   The home fries (always get the home fries over hash browns here) are diced potatoes mixed with sauteed onions, salt, and fresh rosemary. This tastes really good, and perfectly ties together the eggs and bacon. A few small bits of rosemary add a great flavor. The hashbrowns, while they are competently made, are plain in comparison to the home fries. So go with the home fries.  And finally, I save my sourdough bread for dessert. It's served warm with butter and homemade preserves. Superb bread, and together with the preserves makes for a treat.  I also enjoy the ambiance at this location. Even though you might have to go a little out of your way to get to it, parking right in front of it is easy. Once you're inside, it's bright and cheery and has a nice energy without being either too loud or quiet. They don't play music. The wall painting features local landmarks including Hayden Butte and the old flour mill, and the football stadium. The bar seating is really comfortable and serves me well for going in alone with a book.  Tables and booths are great when you're there with other people. The interior isn't hipster/trendy like a lot of places, but also isn't boring or dull. Great place for any breakfast/brunch occasion."}
{"text":"Fresh oj and a great omelette and excellent service! The toast was super fluffy and delicious."}
{"text":"Quite unremarkable. I don't understand the attraction.  I've wanted to try Matt's for a long time. I had heard that they had great Belgian waffles, so perhaps my expectations were high. They were not met. The waffle was served with cold/hard butter - impossible to spread on a waffle. I was hoping for a crispy-on-the-outside - tender-on-the-inside waffle. It wasn't bad... just not what I had hoped for. Served with three strips of peppery, peppery, did I say \"peppery\" bacon. I am not a fan of pepper bacon, but what made it worse, was that it was limp and barely cooked. It was also served (as stated in the menu) with 2 oz. of Pure Maple Syrup. It wasn't enough syrup for the size of the waffle, so I asked for a bit more. Whoa! - That would be an extra $1.50 charge! I declined.  When the waitress stopped to see how things were, I stated my disappointment at the food and the up charge. She left the table and told no one. What appeared to be a manager also stopped by the table. Again, I voiced my displeasure. She left and told the female owner who returned to my table (a plus for communication). The owner said she would take the bacon off the bill (this was also a big plus).   Then, unfortunately, she proceeded to justify why they charged for more syrup; how much it costs and the long process it takes to produce a small amount of Real Maple Syrup (NOT a plus). I said that I understood the \"economics\" of it; I just felt that in this day and age of drink refills, etc. that it was not the greatest of customer service. She continued to argue and state how long she had been a restaurant owner, etc., etc. I was not interested. I WOULD have been interested if she had simply acknowledged my feelings and apologized for the fact that I wasn't satisfied.  In the end, she told me she would take care of the bill. This might have been a plus, but she said it with such disdain, that it literally left a bad taste in my mouth. (I DID leave a tip for the server)  Note to servers, managers and owners: Don't argue with the customer - you will never will the battle, or win us over. Don't try to justify your prices/service/problems, etc. - we don't want to hear the reasons why. We want you to ACKNOWLEDGE the fact that we are not happy. Simply LISTEN - then tell us you are sorry our experience wasn't better.  If you can do or offer something to make it better, GREAT!  But do it with a smile. Kill us with kindness - not contempt."}
{"text":"I waited for 2-3 hours awhile back because everyone was raving about this place.. I had the pork chop but it wasn't anything special. Maybe I was just tired from waiting so long. I didn't get what was so special about the place. But I will try it again and maybe find the magic in it."}
{"text":"This place lives up to it's hype. I had the waffles w/ thick cut bacon and hash browns, the flavors discovered my lost taste buds. The bacon has this special seasoning that goes nicely on it. One of the best hash browns I ever had. Long wait but worth it, the waiters are average they all work together which they try very hard to speed things up. 4.5."}
{"text":"I won't lie. I had been dying to try Matt's Big Breakfast ever since I saw it on DDD years ago. Since I live in NorCal, and the only reason for me to visit the Phoenix area is MLB spring training, Matt's has remained an elusive temptation, taunting me from afar.   So when I decided, after a 20 year absence, to take another trip to baseball's March mecca, I knew that a visit to Matt's was on my short \"must do\" list. I LOVE breakfast, and I am willing to wait for a good one.  It was a little intimidating to roll up and see the hoard of people waiting outside the restaurant on a Tuesday morning, but we put our name on the list and took our place amongst the throng.  We were seated after a wait of just under an hour and the waitress arrived promptly to take our order. My dining buddy and I both ordered the Hog and Chick, she with soft scrambled eggs, sausage and homefries, and I with over medium eggs, bacon and hash browns. We also decided to split a waffle. The homefried potatoes were good, but the hash browns were out of this world-- crispy on the top and bottom and soft and buttery in between. Seriously the best hash browns I've ever had. The bacon was thick and peppery, and lthough the waffle was tasty, I would have preferred it to have a crispier outside. The hand sliced whole wheat toast with homemade strawberry jam was perfect.  I've been to a few places featured on Food Network, and though some of them haven't lived up to expectations, a few of them are home runs (Voula's Offshore Cafe, The Squeeze Inn, Bette's Oceanview Diner). Matt's knocks it out of the park."}
{"text":"I love breakfast food! I wish I could go to breakfast restaurants every day lol. Let me tell you the Belgian Waffle I had here at Matt's was the best Belgian Waffle I have ever had in my life. I also got the home fries which were really good, hash browns not too bad either. I did go a second time a few weeks later and got the same items. I would go again and try the pancakes this time."}
{"text":"We had a terrible experience here.  The place was absolutely deafening; we couldn't talk while eating because we couldn't hear each other.  The food we were served was cold, they messed up my order, and overcharged us.  The waiter only came by to get our orders, deliver the food, and deliver the bill.  He never checked on us or asked how the food was.  Even if the food had been warm, the overall taste was bland and unappealing.  Not a good way to start our day in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Food was great but service was crap. We waited for an 1 to be seated. They skipped our name so we waited 20 extra mins. It would have been longer if I didn't ask what place we were in. I like drink refills and the server didn't ask if I wanted another.  Food 5 stars  Service 2 stars"}
{"text":"SLOOOOOOWWWWW. Do not come here if you have any sort of limitations on time - not even for take out. I've been here a million times and there is NO sense of urgency from anyone. To greet your table, to take orders, to get you anything. I know this and still made the mistake of ordering take out. Why it could possibly take 25+ minutes to make scrambled eggs & toast to go is beyond me. The food is good but not worth the excessive waiting. It borders on ridiculous. The staff is hit or miss with friendliness - but usually miss."}
{"text":"This place was SO built up in my head because my friends love it. At the end of the day, it was just \"pretty good\". I would never avoid the place, but i also would never really feel a need to go back."}
{"text":"I definitely would have to give Matts a 4 stars max, could not give it a 5 stars because I do believe they are of a five star quality but lack any originality as say a Liberty Market.   Have heard a ton about Matts and I do have to say that they have quality food, Went there and had waffles with bacon and a side order of potatoes. They do make basic food very well and that is a good but it is basic food. Nothing imaginative or out of the ordinary, so nothing to really to say WOW that is something new. Again though they do basic food very well which is harder said then done, and that is why I would recommend it, I would not go out of my way though just because of the location and the size of the place, but I only judge by food. If you can get in the food is very good even great."}
{"text":"Had the 3 pancakes and their Bomb.com iced tea (unsweetened, but so good you do not need or want to add sugar) the staff was do great to us. Our table was wobbly and another waitress totally stopped what she was doing to help us out. We will be returning!!"}
{"text":"When I am in the mood for an omelet, hash browns and sourdough, this is my new go-to place! I don't care that I live 45 minutes away, and frankly, I don't care about the wait either!  MBB is worth every penny! So the place is really a hole in the wall, and it is noisy at full capacity. I haven't gotten out of a sit-down breakfast joint with even mediocre omelets and terrible coffee for less than $25.00 for two, but at MBB, we hit the jackpot! Here, I got a fluffy omelet with mushrooms (not from a can) and a mound of cheddar cheese, cooked perfectly (and I didn't even have to ask for it on the soft side), along with a heaping portion of the best tasting hash browns (fully cooked and not part raw)! And the sourdough toast . . . at least an inch thick, already buttered -- yes, buttered -- with homemade strawberry jam on the side. And, did I mention how great the coffee is, and within about four sips, they are there to give you a refill without having to wave them down?  Everyone was so nice, from the nice young man who seated us, to the two (or three) waitresses that alternately handled our table (one took our order, two refilled our coffee, another took our bill). Service was top-notch! I can't think of any restaurant in our area of North Scottsdale that is even close to being this good! Especially for the price!  When our waitress asked if she could get us anything else, I said, \"another Matt's Big Breakfast . . . in North Scottsdale!\"  I've already started coming up with a list of things we have to do in Phoenix so that we can go back to Matt's again!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I really understand the hype around MBB. I guess if you love traditional fare, it's the place for you, but I can make most of their dishes at home, for half the price and none of the long wait."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Phoenix! I had the waffle and bacon, it was the best waffle I've ever tasted! Hubby had the pork chop, he loved it! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great accommodation for food allergies.  Service was a little off...big welcome, but then they didn't notice we were sitting there and served folks who had come in after. Still highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great little diner. Coffee is ok service is good. Food is ok for breakfast. Inexpensive and atmosphere is good."}
{"text":"was in town for spring training walking around one morning looking for a bite to eat and ran into this gem because i saw a line outside and decided if people are waiting this long to get a seat it must be good as to be a reason for the wait and i was not dissapointed i had the special of the day which was eggs benedict with thick cut pieces of ham and a most excellent hollandaise and i destroyed it so much flavor my mouth was doing backflips wish i could have tried so much more on their menu but thats gives me another reason to visit beautiful phoenix again so next time u see a line outside of this place or any for that reason dont run away because there has to be a reason people are waiting to get inside and matts will not"}
{"text":"Quick eat and beverage.  I order the Cobb salad which was subpar.  It was tossed in balsamic which I have never seen before. A lot of the sale was wilted and brown and it was lacking the key ingredients of protein."}
{"text":"This is what breakfast should be!  I am a regular at least once a week.  Monday's, the ranchero verde is the best in the state!"}
{"text":"I really just don't understand the overall hype of this place. While visiting the great city of PHX for a training seminar I took the advice of the awesome people here on Yelp about trying the best place for breakfast in PHX and it was MBB. The food was just hmm ok nothing really to rave about but the only thing I can complain about is the $2.00 charge for syrup!!! Other than that it was ok I would recommend \"Scramble\" on North 7th Street"}
{"text":"I saw Matt's Big Breakfast was listed on the 10 best breakfast places in Phoenix. My son and I drove downtown today to try this place out. Their breakfast menu has about 10 items. My son ordered THE CHOP & CHICK and I ordered CHEESE OMELET w/peppers/onions and we shared the GRIDDLECAKES. Everything was really good. The Griddlecakes had a great flavor.  This is not a place to go it you want to eat and visit. This place, they seat you, take or order, bring you the check, to go box, clear your plates and if you're still in your seat they ask you if you would like a drink to go. I will say, this place is a well-oiled machine the employee work very well together but for me, when I go out to eat I like to visit."}
{"text":"I am 26 years old and I've had a lot of good breakfasts, but I can honestly say this was the best breakfast I've ever had!  We waited 45 minutes at 10 am on a Sunday morning and it was SO worth the wait!  The bacon was semi-sweet, super thick, and had peppery spices on it.  The eggs were fluffy and were so good they did not need salt.  The potatoes had rosemary or lavendar or something and were amazing.  My husband had the steak, it was phenomenal, my bro and sis in law had pancakes that were the best I've ever tasted.  This meal was so good it was almost erotic.  Hubby and I slept all day after.  Eat there."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here on a Saturday morning. The place was packed but they got through the crowd quickly. All fresh cooked and local fresh ingredients.   They don't have a kid's menu (we have two elementary age kids) but they will do off-menu items such as single, large pancakes or waffles.   Service was excellent and very friendly.   We had egg scramble special with jalapeños and locally made chicken sausage. Had a good amount of spicy and a liberal amount of cheese.   The portions were generous to the point where we are half and packed up the other."}
{"text":"It's about time that people be a lot more honest in their reviews of Matt's Big Breakfast. This place is over hyped in every sense, and mainly - still - because of its faux-trendy/hip atmosphere...  that was cute five or so years back. Though, what matters is the food and maybe the surroundings of a place, right?  Well, the servings are hearty (pack an extra artery), and the home fried potatoes are tasty.  That's about it. End of review.  No... got to be a little more honest here.  The rest of the menu is mediocre at best, and hardly worth an hours' wait in line and/or just to be seated, nor enough to chew on or pay for.  The first or second time might be cool, you may enjoy it.  But the third time there you'll be honest to admit that there's far better elsewhere. As surroundings go, the place is like a muggy gym locker room but smaller in size, and so poorly ventilated that you'll think that the proprietor's must think nothing of sitting in the humidity upon a toilet of a rest stop in Austin, TX with their plate of food on their knees. Me thinks that anyone with a few simple squares of aluminum foil and heat could cook any of Matt's menu items within their own kitchen and very likely do better within 20 minutes flat, easy.  I don't mean to sound harsh or scathing, but after hearing so many sheep over hyping this place time after time you realize it's all fake kissy-kiss talk.  \"Phooey!\", I say.  The most important thing you must know and take from this - regardless of whether anything I'm saying here is something you agree with or not - is to beware of the... ehm... \"coffee\".  Sincerely.  I've heard many others state that you must be an incredibly gracious customer to take a sip.  Merely a whiff of its bouquet brings to mind a vinaigrette of acrid rags and dank wool socks.  Most folks count on having a great cup of coffee with their breakfast; a great cup of coffee is obviously required in conjunction with breakfast.  Like the necessary combinations of two things: Sun & Moon, peanut butter & honey, soap & water, doesn't everyone have a knowing that if you're going to serve coffee during breakfast it needs to taste like coffee?  Even if it's the most watered down brew it needs to taste something LIKE coffee.  Apparently Matt's will hear none of that; they don't seem to be aware nor have heard the talk that some folks don't return just because their coffee resembles what Grandpappy brewed up in a drop-pan a week ago ON TOP OF the coffee grounds that he brewed a month ago, then filtered through newspaper taken from the doghouse outside and used a second time to line the bottom of a bird cage.  (Shwew!)  In fact, I can count two separate occasions when I had actually overheard a server apologize to customers who'd commented on their putrid brew.  Utterly disgusting.  The servers and cooks are nice, friendly and personable (I'm talking - genuinely enjoy what they do) and that, admittedly, counts for a whole lot. Nonetheless, give Matt's a try at least once. At least. But, pass on the coffee... or, \"Don't go into the light!\" as they say of near death experiences."}
{"text":"THE WAIT IS WORTH IT! Most breakfast places in Phx., even the so called better ones, are medicore to say the least.  I've lived here my entire life and I can honestly say this is the best breakfast I've ever had in Phoenix. I definitely will go back and wait again. Skip H."}
{"text":"So I'm watching Diners, Drive-in's and Dive's on the Food Network and they do a feature on this place.  Go on and on about the waffles.  So the next morning, we head over.  Walk up to the building and people everywhere just standing around.  So I walk in side and was stopped by a server and told to step outside.  She handed me a clipboard and walked back in.  Apparently, I was suppose to put my own name down on the list to be seated, so I did.  We waited almost and hour.  We were finally called to head in.  Walk in and can't believe how tiny this place is...they sit the three of us down at a table made for one so we're all fighting over elbow space.  Look over the menu and decide to order a waffle, eggs and OJ.  Server tells me the waffle iron is broken.  That was the only reason I came here because of the so called world famous waffles.  So I settle for pancakes, eggs and OJ.  They bring out my teaspoon of OJ.  Seriously I have never had such a small glass of OJ.  The food finally arrives, and to tell you the truth, it was good but not worth the hour of my life I spent standing outside waiting.  I'll stick to IHOP."}
{"text":"Great food but usually really busy. I always love what I order and you can tell they use quality ingredients. The only downside is that you usually have to wait."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork chop. It was succulent and drenched in flavor.  We also ordered home fries and hashbrowns. Personally, I don't really like home fries or hashbrowns very much in general. However, these were seasoned to perfection. I couldn't get enough of them.  My husband ordered the blueberry lemonade.  It was also divine.    The only downside was that it was pretty noisy when you went inside. It was also a bit crowded. We had to wait outside for about 15 minutes before we were called in.  They did provide all those who waited outside with complementary lemon water.  Once inside, the staff was friendly and courteous and our food was brought out to us promptly.  I love Matt's big breakfast."}
{"text":"Amazing bacon. Simply superb and unexpected for an airport terminal. Phenomenal. Great price."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after I saw that Guy Fieri loved the Chop and Chick. We ordered the Chop and Chick with home fries and asked for the strawberry preserves with the toast...yum! The chop was flavorful and eggs cooked perfectly! The honey lemonades are a must! We also got the griddle cakes and they were the best pancakes I have ever had! Moist and perfect! There was a wait but for good reason! Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.   Hip, Cool spot. Only drawback was loud . Everything else great and food was good"}
{"text":"This place is super small, we waited more than 20 minutes to be seated. The food is absolutely delightful and generously portioned."}
{"text":"If you like breakfast, and you want to flavorgasms as you eat, this is the place for you. I got the salami scramble which is three scrambled eggs with molinari sopressata salami, and I got the side of hash browns and toast. (Potato side and toast comes with all egg meals) I never would have thought of salami in the eggs, but it was the perfect complement with the peppery taste it packed. That being said, the eggs themselves were extremely tasty and could have been eaten plain. Coffee was hot, fresh and taste good. The toast was Texas sized toast and they had quite possibly the best strawberry preserves I've had in years, if not ever. Service was fantastic; my only negative that is keeping this from being 5 stars is the hash browns.  I'm not complaining about them, but they weren't on par with the great quality of everything else at Matt's. I highly recommend this place, but the wait can be long depending what day and time you get there (this place is loved by the locals) we got there at 815am on a Sunday and were seated immediately (the last available table)"}
{"text":"MBB tries to be trendy, tries to be hip, tries to be the face of breakfast in Phoenix.....well, they're 0 for 3 and a big strikeout.  Not worth the wait. Overhyped Food is only average Full of food lemmings Without the DDD episode this place would be slightly below average on it's best day.  There are much better choices for breakfast."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to eat at, and I will go out of my way to venture here from Scottsdale. They used to be in a tiny spot that would have an hour plus wait, but they have moved to a much larger location that can seat many more and rarely has a long wait. Try the waffles, or the daily special. Everything is locally sourced and DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"This place is not as good as everyone on Yelp has made it out to be. Be prepared-the whole place is packed and the dining area and the bar are sat by a host who keeps an ever growing waiting list. I was flying solo. The host was able to squeeze me in and offer me one of the bar seats available. The service was fast and friendly. I had the Hog and Chick (two eggs scrambled with thick cut bacon, hash browns and wheat toast). The hash browns and toast were drenched in butter and my thick cut bacon was greasy and fatty. I probably should have went with the Skinny Chick (their egg white and more healthful breakfast option). The jam/preserves they give you for the toast is very scrumptious. And the coffee was good."}
{"text":"A great local place for a filling breakfast!  Just get ready to wait for a table...the space is small but they do a good job of getting people in and out quickly!"}
{"text":"There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said so I'll be fast and say stuff that possibly hasn't been addressed. -A big minus for me, the menu online is outdated.  Add two dollars to the price of everything.  Also the portions seemed to have shrunk a bit from whenever pictures here were taken. -There is only one 4-top, everything else is 2-top or counter, so plan accordingly.  We got there early and put our name on the list despite the agonizing taunt of all those empty 2-tops.  The bf was a little grumpy the waitress didn't put 2 tables together, but admitted there really wasn't room to do that without blocking a path. -The decor is cute and Ikea-esque.  Very clean and bright, I felt like I was in a Real Simple spread. -The blueberry jam tastes like normal blueberry jam.  It's cute and nice to get in a cup instead of a package, but otherwise not special. -I ordered bacon because everyone said the bacon was amazing, even though the sausage looked really good.  My bacon was thick-cut but burned and not particularly tasty regardless of doneness. -They cooked my eggs over medium!  I always ask and usually get over easy anyway.  I appreciate the effort, maybe he was concentrating and accidentally burned my bacon. -The home fries have a LOT of rosemary, so don't get it if you're not a big fan.  It perfumed the whole plate and the leaves soaked in the oil seeped into everything.  I liked it. -Don't come here if you want a quiet, private breakfast experience.  The guy sitting behind us seemed grouchy as soon as he was seated and spent the meal glaring at my in-laws, presumably for speaking loudly over the restaurant noise (like everyone else).  He made a lot of pointed throat-clearing and loud newspaper rustling that seemed to embarrass the crap out of his wife and perplex patrons around us.  I really don't know what we did, but don't be this guy."}
{"text":"(The opening times on Yelp aren't correct)  Decent burger - decent beer, decent service 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in downtown Phoenix. Not that there's a ton of competition. Old school food with modern twist. The staff was super nice and quick. Prices are decent. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast:  Yes it's busy.  Yes it's tiny.  And yes there's a 45 min. wait on a weekday @ 10:30.  Don't you people work?!    But you know what?  All these things add to the charm of the place.  I secretly believe that people like to wait, they love the anticipation, people eat that sh*t up.    Now, with that being said, on to the food, it truly is delicious. There is no hype when the restaurant can actually deliver and prove that it was worth every minute of the wait.   Lemonade: fresh squeezed and flavored with honey.  A natural sweetener that is incredibly refreshing on a hot day.   Waffle: most definitely the best waffle I have ever had.  Fluffy, light, piping hot, real butter and real maple syrup.   Omelet: quite possibly the best omelet I have ever had.  Cooked to perfection with American cheese, mushrooms and bacon.  No skimping on these additions either, large button mushrooms, plenty of cheese and large chunks of thick cut bacon.   The bottom line....  Matt's Big Breakfast:  Big on taste.  Big on portions.  Big on appeal.  Even bigger on charm."}
{"text":"I remember watching this on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives. I really liked this place. Great food and the staff was great. The wait...More than worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Be ready to wait because it is very popular place."}
{"text":"A good place to enjoy a late breakfast marred by relentless crowds insistent that eggs waited an hour to eat taste better. Easier to get in as a solo diner."}
{"text":"The food was unique according to breakfast standards. All the staff were very friendly and able to provide excellent service - even with all customers. The food was delivered quickly and tasty, and the waitress behind the bar was always quick to refill my coffee and ice water during my stay here, I Recommend."}
{"text":"We initially thought it was a cozy place and enjoyed the atmosphere. They seemed to be disorganized or confused about which server was helping each table. We never knew who was our server as we had 3 different people ask if someone had taken our drink order. The hash browns were extremely burned. The server gave us an attitude when we asked for separate checks. Not sure if they deserve a second chance."}
{"text":"Worth the wait AND the hype. I ordered the pancakes, which admittedly are a standard staple, but they were amazingly delicious and I had to finish the entire massive portion. I didn't eat again until dinner after consuming these fluffy, flavorful pillow of carbohydrate bliss, which were just accentuated by the whipped butter and maple syrup.  The service is fast and the line moves quickly, but there was a line even at 10 a.m. on a random Friday."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because the menu is somewhat limited. However it had everything I wanted and was delicious. People are very friendly and a cool sort of vibe.."}
{"text":"From LA area visiting Scottsdale AZ this place was great bought some strawberry jam ketchup and bbq sauce for Home breakfast was awesome will return"}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast is pretty yummy. I would have to agree though that a big fuss is made over this place. I have had the pancakes twice and both times they seemed dry. I think the biggest problem I have had is having a \"big breakfast\" and not enough to wash down my pancake the size of a UFO with. The juice is understandably \"freshly squeezed\" but a glass the size of a shot glass for almost 3 bucks is ridiculous. Personally I'm not one to enjoy water with a meal, which is probably your best choice so you don't end up spending your life savings on shots of OJ. They do have sodas but in a can and that's if you are an RC fan. The funny thing is I tried once to bring in a drink to help with the aid in digestion of my breakfast and they have a sign on the front door that reads \"No outside beverage\". Damn!"}
{"text":"What do they do to make a basic breakfast so good? Well, actually mine wasn't basic. I took the special off the board: Andouille sausage, havarti cheese (I think), a lovely red spicy pepper three egg omelette AH-mazing, their famous potatoes on the side. Thick slices of whole grain bread on the side with a tiny bit of butter (I wish it had more). One of my kids had the breakfast sandwich with bacon, one had the chicken marinated in pesto sandwich, and the husband had something I can't remember but everyone was very full, very happy even after waiting well over an hour to get seated.  We did ask for a grilled cheese sandwich for our kid and the waitress looked at us stunned and said it's not on the menu. True but they have bread and cheese right? Oh well. What I loved more than anything was every staff person you come in contact with says: Thank you for waiting!   I hope to go back soon even though it's a 40 minute drive from my house and more than likely an hour wait to get in - it's worth it."}
{"text":"The best breakfast you will ever have. I can't tell you why - maybe take the most simple foods but make sure they are the highest quality, cook with butter or olive oil and you get perfection?  I don't know the secret but people will wait in line for over 30 minutes to eat OATMEAL there?!  I've eaten there twice - my first review must have been written on the other location. This time I had the simple breakfast sandwich. Two eggs, bacon, cheese on a soft fluffy roll. The bacon is outrageous, thick, peppery yum. The sandwich is really big and luscious.  My older kid gets the basic eggs, potatoes, toast and bacon. The younger got the waffles - incredible light, fluffy and flavorful. I can't remember what my husband got but he was a happy, happy man.  The wait is tough especially in summer heat. I've been approached by homeless folks both times. The last one was hilarious. He asked me for a cigarette and I told him I don't smoke. He looked at me with amazement and asked: How did you quit??? Like we have been the best friends forever and he is in awe in my ability to quit. Ha! I laughed and said I've never smoked. He nicely moved on to the next group.  **I had to edit this as I forgot to compliment the service. I love, love, love how everyone says \"thank you for waiting\". There is no arrogance here. Super attentive service always offering more water or coffee."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've EVER had! At an airport?! It was almost worth missing my next flight. If you have to be stuck in an airport, look for this restaurant!"}
{"text":"It's everything and then some.  I only give it four stars because of how packed it is, and it can be kind of claustrophobic at times.  Other than that, I will wait all day in that line outside just to eat here!  So super yummy!  Definately a must try!"}
{"text":"Because of all of the other yelpers describing the long waits, my partner and I decided to try Matt's on a Wednesday, mid morning.  We waited about 10 minutes before being seated.  I enjoyed the unpretentious atmosphere of Matt's Big Breakfast.  The service was excellent.  When I say excellent, I mean our waitress took our drink orders immediately, answered our questions expertly, and brought our meals exactly as ordered (which is impressive because I can be a tad high maintenance).  Our food was pipping hot and very tasty.  I had the cheddar omelette and added mushrooms and onions. I ordered home fries (roasted potatoes with rosemary and onions) and fresh squeezed orange juice.  The orange juice was just the right size, and not too sweet.  The omelette was chock full of mushrooms, onions and cheddar.  The potatoes were golden brown and delicious with a little extra salt.  My partner ordered the griddle cakes which she said were soft, buttery and with the real maple syrup, yummy.  While Matt's is pretty small, I think there's plenty of room to enjoy a great meal!"}
{"text":"Beware food may be unsafe!!  Three of us ate here yesterday.   Service was fine, but we were sick all last night and today.  100+ temperatures.  Clearly food poisoning.  They should have their cleanliness and food preparation checked."}
{"text":"I love this place, this is basically the Harlow's of downtown Phoenix.  The food is great - that cook makes one hell of an omelet, the first one I ate was so good I sent a tip back to him.  The waitresses that work the counter remember your usual order after 2-3 times, and it's just a great experience.  The only reason I would put it a tiny notch behind Harlow's is that they don't have as diverse a menu, but that's not that big a deal to me, as long as I get my omelette.  Great breakfast place."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time about 10 days ago, on a Saturday morning around 9am.  We had to wait about 30-40 mins.  Holy smokes!  What a meal!  Menu - very limited!  Like 7 items for breakfast.  I was dubious...  Coffee - A+ - locally roasted by the Roastery of Cavecreek.  Fantastic! What a surprise and a delight!  Toast - A+ - artisan bread, very thick, with real butter.  We got the whole grain.  Amazing!j Oh - with homemade fresh preserves.  Hashbrowns - A+ - holy smokes, I don't know how they managed to take something so mundane and make it terrific.  Crispy, crunchy outside, softer on the inside without becoming mushy (retaining texture) and flavorful to boot!  Eggs - A - I can't really evaluate the eggs too much, because I put 'em on top of the hashbrowns and diced 'em up.  Service - B+ - Service was great - until the end when our guy left the check and dropped us like a hot potato.  I wanted more coffee.  They were SUPER busy, and scurrying all over.  I'll give them a B+ overall on service.  We even had an older guy check in on us to make sure everything was alright - like a manger or owner?  But ya gotta finish strong, too.  Paid our bill, and was able to get a small \"to go\" cup from the cashier.  That coffee was so delicious!  In the end, it was absolutely amazing to me that such simple familiar fare could be so outstandingly better than typical.  It really was quite a surprise.  I love breakfast at restaurants - probably my favorite meal of the day.  I SO MUCH WISH this place was closer to where I live.  This is what all restaurants aspire to be."}
{"text":"My family took me here for breakfast today 9/13/15.  See my yelp review for Charlston's yesterday which was 5 star.  This was my first encounter with Matt's.  It was for my birthday as was Charilston's yesterday.  Unbelievable!  Are you nuts?  Almost, not quite an HOUR wait on the street??????? And then, when we get in there, NO ice in the water?  No lemon slices for our \"free NO ice water\".  And, NO  salsa for the potatos?????   We asked the waitress to break down the bill (11 of us) and she said they will not do this.  HO HO  HO.  NEVER AGAIN!!   Finally NO regular white bread toast???  This place is a joke.  I spent a dollar extra for a BIG piece of burnt ham steak.  I wouldn't do this for TJ's out on Avondale south of Van Buren which is truly great!!!  If you're on the West Side, go to TJ's.  If you're on the East Side, try Mircle Mile on the the weekends for breakfast or the Bisbee Cafe on Dobson and Guadalupe.    This place is way the hexx overrated.."}
{"text":"I refuse to tell anyone about this place.  The last thing I want is for it to get so crowded that I have to wait an hour and a half to get a seat, like the Matt's downtown. So, stay away! It's all mine!   But if you insist on continuing to read this, then I guess I'll have to tell you that this is the best breakfast joint around. Everything is cooked to perfection and the staff are very friendly and attentive.   Hog alert! If you love bacon, you won't find any better-anywhere in Arizona. Period.   This particular Matt's has a great open view next to Tempe Town Lake. The only down side is that parking is a premium because... it's at Tempe Town Lake.   Don't let me catch you here making me wait for a table! lol"}
{"text":"We stopped here on the road home to Austin.  We try to eat gluten free which was kinda hard for me as a vegetarian. So, I went for the waffles, which comes with bacon, and they would not let me substitute it for eggs. So I had to buy eggs on top which was kinda weird.  They also tried to sit my husband and I at a two top table with our toddler and infant.  I'm sure you can imagine how crazy it was trying to eat with our drinks, etc... For four people on a two top.  They did eventually let us add a second two top, but I was already feeling anxiety from the logistics of juggling the situation that it was hard to enjoy my food when it came.  The food was AWESOME.  Three rating for the logistical issues."}
{"text":"Yes on every level! I love the small, hipster vibe. I feel like this place is authentic in that regard even though it's becoming \"so mainstream\" to have a restaurant that is laid back. I love the bacon!It is my favorite bacon in Phoenix! I eat a TON of breakfast restaurants/takeout . It just depends on what you are looking for in a breakfast or brunch and mood. I am sure you will enjoy this rustic vibe. And did I say BACON?"}
{"text":"Our favorite bruch spot in Phoenix. Great food, good portions and fast and kind service! The toast and jam is so good!"}
{"text":"Matt's has spoiled me for breakfast anywhere else...even at home. Remember the days when  you were satisfied with fast-food breakfasts or even Shoneys? They say a dog will chew on a bone until you give him a steak..and once I tried Matt's, I couldn't go back to growth-hormone, trans-fatty el cheapo choke n puke.   Been to Matt's at all locations, including the airport, and the Tempe location delivers the goods just like you want them to. Everything locally sourced, jam home made, and pure maple syrup.  Organic cage free eggs, and their iconic thick cut bacon. I personally love the french toast! There is literally not a bad item on the menu. Yes, it is popular...yes, you might have to wait. But that's a trifle when you are sitting down to the highest quality, tastiest breakfast/brunch meal in town.   If you want to try the lunch, go for the Reuben, the Burger or the BLT. They all rock."}
{"text":"Wowzer ! I love this place. I get to a lot of breakfast places but this is awesome.  #1. The service is some of the best I have ever seen. Very happy attentive folks!   #2. The food was always fresh, local, cooked perfect."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast. Hash browns were awesome along with cheese omelet/onions/ mushrooms and sourdough bread. Cool spot in Roosevelt Row."}
{"text":"Every time I fly out of phx, I always eat here. It's amazing. Great food and great service. Sit at the bar, Paul the bartender gets you in and out fast."}
{"text":"So the food is fine..but the \"new\" location eeew! Its sooooo gross!! We sat st the bar and right at the window next to us was  a homeless guy takung off his socks..then makinga drug deal..then across the st a guy jumped in the dumpster and a transient couple was making out on a tarp..came from california and was wanting to eat here..never again!! The parking scks too if you do come here the reuben looked good and strawberry lemonsde was yummy. My salad was meh.."}
{"text":"Enjoy it when I can get in, but the last two times that hasn't happened courtesy of their new host. Both times went by myself to sit at the counter. Both times was asked to wait, then watched multiple others show up and just grab the seats. He has no control of the dining room and appears continuously overwhelmed."}
{"text":"This place had really good food (especially the bacon) and was timely with my takeout order. It saved me from early morning starvation so 5 stars !"}
{"text":"It's 5 freakin Stars!!!!  I've had the pleasure of eating at this establishment several times and I am continuously impressed by the goodness of the food and customer service this fine establishment has to offer.   The  food prices here are more than reasonable based on the quality and portion sizes offered. You can order the special and it will feed two at the right portion sizes. I leave food on my plate almost every time as I am stuffed.   Two areas to be prepared for are: 1) to wait outside in the phoenix desert heat to be seated, this is the rule; the exception is walking straight in and being seated. 2) The restrooms are there but the only hold one person at a time. If you got to go you may wait again in line.!In the men's restroom they have a toilet and urinal but no divider, so it's one at a time. Can't speak on the ladies as I am not one nor am I a pervert.  The customer service is awesome to me; I am called by name. I go here but I'm not a regular."}
{"text":"Attentive and creative service is hard to come by these days. This 5 star is mostly as a result of the service provided by Michelle. After looking over the menu which seemed pretty limited I had made up my mind that I'd just enjoy the amazing coffee at Matt's and opt for a short ride to Snooze instead for food. I let Michelle know that nothing really stood out so I'd take my check for the coffee. She said with a warm smile \"Is there something you were looking for? I'm sure we can make you happy!\" I told  her I was a fan of a skillet type of breakfast. She immediately said she could do that and started making recommendations on what to include in it. Just seemed to genuinely care about making me happy with a great breakfast which kicked my Friday off perfectly. Off-menu skillet was great Michelle! Matt's lucky to have you:)"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait, but it is so worth it. Must try the Belgian Waffle!! so so good. Totally homey, down to earth deliciousness. Just GO!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town. Be ready to wait almost any time. Better towards closing time at 2:30. They use local ingredients. Yummy waffle with huge piece of bacon is the best."}
{"text":"Boring menu, super long wait, everything here is just OK. You will wait more than an hour if you go on the weekends, you will Be starving by the time you're seated, and you will get your food and think: \"that's it?\"   Not sure why this place is so popular, it could be so much better."}
{"text":"Best airport breakfast EVER! One of the best breakfast joints ever. Potatoes well seasoned with fresh rosemary. Bacon is thick and meaty and also peppered nicely. Food has really good flavor. We got double charged for coffee because we got it at the to-go side & then decided to sit, but it was an understandable oversight. Other than that service friendly and attentive. Love that they have ketchup without high fructose corn syrup & pure honey."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend. Don't let first impression fool you. Very small. Air conditiones. Street parking. Service was phenomenal. Food was great. Ate the daily special omelette (3 eggs, turkey sausage, peppers) with tortilla and hash browns. Very good. Will definitely return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Best waffle ever! Cute atmosphere, you can tell he loves what he does! Good job, Matt"}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is good. The food is AMAZING! It's a must go here in Phoenix. Just be prepared, because of how awesome it is- it will be crowded. But oh so worth it."}
{"text":"Our first stop when arriving in Phoenix! It was fantastic the very vegetarian friendly! I loved my veggie omelet and my boys said the best waffles ever! Definitely a must while in the Phoenix area"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!  Everything on the menu is incredible.  Especially loved the Belgian waffle.  The ambiance is a bit basic and hole in the wall, but the service is great and the food is the BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"I was willing to wait for 1 1/2 hour  for the best breakfast I  was reading about ... boy, I was disappointed.  CON: *Bacon was dry .. really really dry *Hash brown  ... burnt on the outside soggy with butter on the inside. Don't get me wrong. I love my butter .. but that was just way too much. *Tables are tiny - we had 3 pple and a toddler  and they put us with a table  for 2. Please explain to me how we were suppose to eat ?  PRO: *Matt was really nice *Service was great *The sour dough bread with blueberry jam was really good.  Will I go back ?  ... No."}
{"text":"**Disclaimer: this post is long.  For a summary/breakdown of my rating, scroll to the bottom.  Let me begin by saying that if I could award this establishment 0 stars, I would have. I visited Matt's for the first time yesterday morning with a few of my coworkers.  I was told great things about this restaurant and was excited to try it out.  I ordered their special which was an egg and cheese scramble with pepper jack cheese, pork tenderloin, and roasted green chilies; it came with choice of hash browns or diced potatoes and a flour tortilla.  A friend told me they had great diced potatoes so I went with it. Wrong choice. I love potatoes, I love flavor, but there is such thing as over seasoning, and Matt's perfected the act.  I took a bite of the potatoes first, before trying anything else, before adding anything to flavor my food, and was blown away by the amount of rosemary.  I assumed it was just a fluke, nope. Tried another potato and it was just as bad.  You couldn't taste the potato at all!  Just seasonings.  I doused them in ketchup and still couldn't choke them down. The scramble was decent, nothing spectacular, nothing awful. The flour tortilla was terrible.  I assumed they were homemade, since Matt's boasts about all their natural, non-gmo, freshly this-and-that food.  The only way to describe the flavor was salt dough, the kind you have a five year old put their hand in to create a Christmas ornament... Yuck!  I asked for some butter, which came with a side of judgement that I will get to in a moment, to put on my tortilla but it didn't help at all, I gave up on it and tossed it down on my plate next to my unfinished rosemary...I mean potatoes. I also had a \"large\" glass of fresh squeezed orange juice.  It tasted good, but silly me, I didn't think to check the price before I ordered it.  $4.50 for a large glass that was /maybe/ 16oz.  I get that they offer freshness where most do not, but get a grip!  I know this issue was my own fault, it could have been avoided if I had just glanced at the price.  The juice is not factored into their low rating.  Let's discuss the service!  Since it was a late, weekday morning, I didn't anticipate much of a crowd, and to my relief, there wasn't one, so we were seated rather quickly.  Someone promptly brought us water and took our drink orders, then made several trips to bring us our drinks (there were only 5 of us).  Whatever, we got over it.  Then we went to order and discovered that substitutions are not made, even for those with food allergies and intolerances.  Because that's fair, right?  We didn't have to wait long for our food to come out, which was nice, but then the service fell flat, like their job was done, time to move on to the new paying customers (not that there were a whole lot of them).  A completely new waitress came and asked as we were finishing up how things were, which was when I asked for a side of butter.  She looked at my plate as if to see what I could possibly need butter for, as if it was any of her business.  Got the butter, it didn't help make my tortilla taste better, then they dropped the check off (I had inquired about separate checks when we were ordering...they don't do that here).  This may just be my own issue, but I feel that we shouldn't have to ask the waitress to refill our water, yet I did.  It's called being attentive in your customer service.  The vibe that this place put off was just plain snobbish.  I stem from Southern California, where restaurants with natural, non-gmo dishes are a dime a dozen, and they don't serve up near as much of a pretentious attitude as this small diner in downtown Phoenix.  Honestly this place needs a huge reality check.  Rating summary:  Customer service: 0/5 stars for being completely unaccommodating Food quality (taste): 1/5 stars because natural food should not taste this bad... Prices: 2/5 stars because I understand that natural food is not always cheap, but that doesn't mean gouge your customers. Atmosphere: 0/5 stars; over-priced, penny-pinching and pretentious do not make for a good restaurant vibe.  Overall: terribly overrated.  Do yourself a favor and make your own natural breakfast at home; it'll taste better, save you money, and the service you'd get couldn't be any worse than what you'd receive at Matt's."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast!! One of the best I think. You have to wait for it but your won't regret it. If I return to Phoenix I'll go back here for sure."}
{"text":"I am an avid visitor at the downtown location, so this visit was very disappointing. I had high hopes at first because they were able to accommodate my request to substitute meat for pancakes at no extra charge, however my dreams were crushed when the food came out less than 5 minutes later.   The pancakes just weren't good. I've had \"just add water\" box pancakes better than these.  I requested scrambled eggs, but I got a fried egg chopped up. The potatoes were cold and tasted as if they threw some hour-old potatoes on my plate. I love Matt's potatoes, so I know how they should taste.   When I told my waiter my issues with the food she took my plate back to the kitchen. Then she returned with the check, expressing how she gave me a 10% discount. I hate ate a few bites of my food, so I was baffled that she was charging me basically full price for a meal I did not eat. I agreed to pay for the pancakes because I ate most of them, but refused to pay for the eggs and potatoes. The manager approached me, and with a not so great attitude told me they weren't going to charge me for the meal. He didn't apologize for the terrible service, but instead acted as if I was just being problematic.   Again, I love Matt's Big Breakfast, but I will stick with the downtown location and never patronage at the airport location again!"}
{"text":"So, this place is hidden so it was a little hard to find but when I finally found it there weren't very many parking spaces available. So, I found one and walked over and noticed there is no sign or anything explaining what to do because when you get there you walk through a little gate and there are people sitting at tables outside and inside people are sitting and eating. We sat at the table outside for about 15 min before being told we had to get our names on the wait list.... so we did and the wait was long. We were finally seated inside and they don't have much variety so we ordered and my companion got a side of hash browns that came out looking like green ramen noodles. The food was mediocre and the server was getting really friendly with my companion. Wasn't terrible but wasn't great, I probably wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Not the best but not the worst.  I took a seat at the counter since there was a wait for a table and I was a party of one. Bartender/waitress flopped down a menu.  After perusing, I ordered The Hog and Chick, which was basic eggs, meat, potatoes and toast. I asked if I could pay extra to substitute a pancake for the toast.  Waitress gave me a dumbfounded look and said \"yeah, I guess but I don't know how to do that\".  That was the red flag I should have paid attention to. Then she asked, \"sausage, bacon, or ham?\" I picked ham.  Ordered a coffee that came in a tiny cup. They don't have cream, just milk.  Food arrived, decent in taste and usual presentation.  Pancake was small and average.  Here's the kicker...ticket showed pancake substitute was $5! For one pancake.  Ham was an extra $5! (which I just discovered should have only been an extra $1)Tiny coffee that I had to ask for a refill was $3.50. My ticket was $26 for a slightly better breakfast than Dennys! I didn't question it as the waitress didn't seem like one to mess with.   Entertainment was a super flamy and friendly waiter catering to his customers and giving much better service than I had and watching a line cook repeatedly digging out waffles that were stuck in the waffle iron and ripping in half. He used them anyway for the waffle orders to go. Too spendy for what I ordered, probably wouldn't recommend nor return.  The place should be called Matt's Big Ticket Breakfast. Boo."}
{"text":"One of the best places for breakfast. The place is very cute,the staff is very friendly. The food is one of the best and the homemade jelly is outstanding! The owner is nice and a hard worker, so is the rest of the staff !"}
{"text":"Great place to eat between flights. Was hungry and tried their breakfast and it was amazing!! Definitely coming here again. Super great friendly service makes this a top notch place for me."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 31/2 stars...  First of all...just check this place out and decide for yourself- that is if  you don't die of heat stroke while waiting in the 110 degree summer sweatfest that is most notably Phoenix. Or better yet just thank Matt once you make it inside for not bothering to accommodate patrons with some type of effing shading device!!!!! PLANT SOME TREES!!!! UMBRELLAS!!!! OVER HANG! PATIO! A GUY U PAY $3.35/hr WITH A HUGE PIECE OF CARDBOARD! ANYTHING! ok..you get the point.  (I understand this setup in any other state people, but seriously....!) and btdubs..the outside is just fugly...trees plz!  blah blah blah... once you make it inside everything is great! Simple, basic food, friendly service, quaint atmosphere, decent prices. Yeah you could make it at home, but you can make any breakfast food at home, that is the point of \"going out\" for breakfast.  *TIP! call ahead and order and then eat while you walk to your car! superkewl time saver DOH!"}
{"text":"This morning's target was Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix. After all of the media hype over this little original were they going to be as good as promised?  We were thrilled to find that Matt's is very close to the Light Rail stop at Roosevelt and Central, so we took the train and didn't have to worry about finding a parking spot. A very good thing as it turns out as there are a few parking lots near Matt's but all of them were full.  I had heard that's Matt's was small, but I was not prepared for just how small. One car garage small. Including the kitchen! This causes a major problem for hungry customers, the wait was nearly two hours! Wow, this place must be great if people are willing to stand out in the rain for nearly two hours to get in.  Once we were inside and seated things actually moved pretty quickly. We actually had food inside of ten minutes of ordering. The only con inside I saw really was how loud it was. But hey, I could live with that.  The food was very good. My wife had the Chop and Chix, a lovely seasoned pork chop, eggs perfectly cooked, home style potatoes and toast. I had a Salami Scramble, three eggs, Molinari sopresseta, hash browns and toast. It was all very good, very flavorful.  However, after the hype and the nearly 2 hour wait to get in I was expecting outstanding not just very good. The other reality check item for Matt's was the price. I ordered a soda, $2.75, what I received was a 12oz can of soda. Yup, nearly twice the price of a six-pack of soda at any store in town for one can. A 4oz glass of orange juice, granted freshly squeezed, was also nearly $3.00. Hmmm, I didn't order any.   Total bill for our breakfast was $27.00 plus tip.  Bottom line? Matt's Big Breakfast has very good food, but only very good food. There was nothing exceptional here to justify all of the hype, there are many other breakfast places here in town with food at least as good if not better than Matt's for less money and without the marathon wait to get in.  If you go to Matt's expect to wait at least an hour, you will enjoy the food I promise. Only you can decide if the wait and the price are worth it."}
{"text":"thanks to diner drive ins and dives and guy fierri for bringing this place up on the show wow its the best place in town from service from start to finish thanks sooo yummy and clean worth the long waits to get in try it!!!"}
{"text":"In town for meeting and found Matts Big Breakfast.   Great food and service.  Recommend highly."}
{"text":"This local eatery was excellent.  From the eggs to the irresistible home fries and the awesome sourdough toast with fresh preserves, a truly great meal.  Parking was tough due to local construction."}
{"text":"I've been in love with Matts since my first visit to the Phoenix location! The food is delicious, the service is fantastic, and it has, in my opinion, the most delicious breakfast served anywhere. I'm so happy they've expanded to Tempe.  I would recommend The Chop and Chick as a great place to get a sampling of savory heaven. The pork chop is seasoned perfectly and is a perfect example of being tender yet firm. The eggs are always sublime, and the home fries will never disappoint.  If you've got a sweet tooth, the pancakes or the waffle are also delicious. I'd kill for their batter recipe.  Will continue to keep coming back for more"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant. First, let me say that this restaurant has awesome fresh squeezed orange juice, excellent coffee, and great service. The food was generally good. Ham was tough in spots, and my meal was definitely in need of salt and pepper.The port in my breakfast special had no taste at all. Hashbrowns were somewhat burnt. I could live with this though. However, I had to mark this restaurant down due to the lack of comfort of the \"urban\" stainless steel stools that are provided to customers at the counters. Here I think style was a major concern over comfort, and I urge the owners in this eatery to sit on their own stools for an hour to experience the whole dining experience. While eating there, I spent most of the time trying not to slide off of these quite small, hard and slippery shiny stainless steel wonders, and since no rail to rest your feet on is provided, staying on them depends on you using the small rails along the bottom of the stool to try and stay on them. By the end of the meal, we couldn't wait to get out of there, just so we could stand up and stretch out our backs from the lack of support, hardness, and strain of trying to stay on these little torture devices. If the idea is to make it uncomfortable enough to keep the turnover quick at the counters, then they are perfectly suited for the task. However, we will strongly reconsider whether to return, and if we do, will never sit at the counter again. Good food is available all over the valley, and being comfortable while eating is also available all over the valley.   As a suggestion to attract and keep customers, I want to make a couple of suggestions:  Fix the stool situation. They are a big drawback.  During the breakfast wait, instead of that watery whatever it is that you offer to all the people waiting outside (water? lemonade?), serve coffee. When the guy brought that out, many of us said \"Coffee, awesome!\", and then realized it was something far less appealing. By bringing out coffee and mugs (OK to use a variety from Goodwill or whatever), you will have an automatic coffee sale and people will enjoy hanging out while waiting. You can stage it from inside to control losses and offer it to those on the waiting list if you want, but it would endear a customer such as myself to the restaurant.   When you put down the check, explain how it works. \"We can take care of this for you or you can pay at the counter\" would be helpful. We weren't sure what to do and had to ask.  As it is, we may or may not return to this restaurant. Might give it one more try."}
{"text":"little gem, i love it! Good local positive vibe!"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast and their bacon is to die for...I always stop when flying thru..skip their brkfst sausage tho but be sure to get a Bloody Mary...Yumm!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed the second time around. Service was awful as in she took my order delivered it and never once came back to see how it turned out. When I was leaving I told her how awful it tasted she said sorry have a great day. My french toast was so undercooked and burnt on the outside I couldn't even finish it."}
{"text":"This was my go to place for breakfast then about 6 months ago I realized my last two visits had drastically changed. The hash browns were not cooked like they used to be at all and were disappointing. The food over all was just ok, not the GREAT experience it used to be. I hope they have improved again and weeded out that bad cook. I might add the new location although bigger has lousy acoustics and all sound is magnified beyond comfort. VERY LOUD! Not conducive to a good time."}
{"text":"Matt's was the perfect breakfast after a wedding the night before. The food is delicious and high quality. I loved the taste of all of the ingredients. I had the chicken sandwich and the breast meat was juicy, and paired fantastically with the pesto sauce."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of people talking about this place so decided to try.  Small space with a lot of 2-tops so I'm glad I came in a party of 2!!  Expect to wait a long time if you bring a bigger group.   Food is good, executed well and quality ingredients.  The waffle is great!   It's EXTREMELY LOUD in here and for that reason I probably won't come back.. I couldn't hear my breakfast companion at all which kinda ruined the point of going out for breakfast in the first place. Concrete floor, brick walls.. They would do well to make some small changes, hang up some fabric or canvas on the walls, panels on the ceiling to cut down on noise."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! I waited an hour for this brunch while visiting friends a month ago, and the memory makes my mouth water.   I never, ever drink hot coffee -- but even that was delicious.   The waffle was light and flavorful, and I practically inhaled its buttery goodness. (It was admittedly kinda wimpy compared to my friends' plates, especially without the bacon for this vegetarian).  The macaroni salad was unusual -- with a vinegar or vinaigrette dressing -- but lighter than traditional and very tasty.   Totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! This has to be one of the best in Phoenix. The waffles were light and fluffy and the bacon was perfect"}
{"text":"Great food, and the service from Chelsea was second to none. Overall the experience was fantastic."}
{"text":"The best! I love to stop and eat at Matt's while waiting to leave from Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"Stopped by on Saturday.  Placed was packed (no surprise), so I rescheduled my visit to Monday morning when it was less crowed.  Grabbed a seat at the counter and was cheerfully greeted and offered my choice of beverage.  I ordered the waffle which came with bacon (unlike the pancakes which don't) and a 2 eggs on the side.  My order came lickity-split except there was only one egg, not two.  Not to worry, I was assured that it would get corrected and it did.    The waffle and bacon were delicious.  Authentic butter and real maple syrup.....yummy.  The eggs were.....eggs. Coffee cup never reached the bottom and was always being refilled.  Considering the place is called Matt's Big Breakfast, one would think that there would be offerings on the menu....but the place was still packed so Matt must be doing something right.  I'll be back and recommend that you pay them a visit when you are in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Nice enough server, but evidently there is a condiment shortage: no ranch or bleu cheese dressing, no sour cream. Bread for tuna sandwich looked as if it had the possibility of tasting good but I didn't try it as it seemed to have been left in the arid AZ sun all day today; dry as a bone. Beer good. Glass warm. May be my least favorite airport meal to date."}
{"text":"I wanted to come here because it's close my house and the gym I became a member at. I walked in with my girlfriend, there were two spots open at the bar and 2 or 3 tables open, we didn't wanna wait behind the two people waiting and no one was at the counter. So, we decided to sit at the bar, ever place I've ever been the bar is open, we sat down, looked at the menu only but a second and a mar came up to us very loudly and said \"there are two people in front of you, you can't sit here\". Mind you there were several tables open and the two people in front of us had been sitting there waiting. Was very unprofessional to announce it like that and since when is the bar part of seating? I'll avoid this place and take my business elsewhere, I understand this might be minor, but when there are multiple places open and you disrespect customers, it's never ok."}
{"text":"Matt's food is fantastic. The BEST hashbrowns I've ever had in my life. I often get the chop and chick and it's delicious. The toast is thick and comes with homemade jam. My one complaint--and it's a huge one for me--is that they do not have cream for their coffee! I simply don't understand their thought process in not offering cream. Their coffee is good, but not with milk or almond milk. Sorry, but this has actually been a dealbreaker for me and I will go to the Phoenix Market Cafe close by instead. I couldn't take a star off for it though because their food is so good. But PLEASE PLEASE Matt, offer CREAM for your coffee and I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but this one needs to be known. I live in Phoenix and usually fly out of gate B where this restaurant is located. I past by it going to my gate today and it was very busy. After I checked into my gate I had some extra time to go and have some food and a drink. I stood there for the hostess to take my name on the reservation which she never wrote it down, I asked how long and she said it would be 5-10 mins. I said okay, she continued to take others peoples names with 1 to 4 people in their party. She never acknowledge me, I finally said you didn't write down my name and then she finally did. No sorry, nothing. In the end she went over my name twice and sat two different reservations, I finally walked away. I am glad I didn't spend a dime at this restaurant. The worst customer service ever. I recommend going somewhere else to spend your money."}
{"text":"Just about the best waffle and bacon I've ever had... Wow! Excellent coffee and service too."}
{"text":"The food was good but the 45 minute wait ruined my experience."}
{"text":"What can I say That Ayesha didn't already cover? I love breakfast..and I love butter. Breakfast + butter + more butter = Matt's.   I had an omelette which was filled with delicious cheese and as Ayesha mentioned the mushrooms had been cooked up in butter before going into the mix which is how I do it at home. The eggs were fluffy and delicious. The toast was thick. THICK.   Yes the wait was long. The windows are huge so you can make those already eating uncomfortable by staring at them as they eat which is sort of fun right?  The shooting pain in my left arm makes it hard to type, but with the smile on my face I am forced to try to put out this one last review before my early death to butter clogged arteries.   They also got a boost when on the way out every single staff member shouted to us thank yous, and have a good days, and come back soons. Sweet folks. I will have to go back after the bypass surgery."}
{"text":"Great food! Very creative menu with basic breakfast foods. The service was prompt, but the wait was 20 minutes so be prepared for that...."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a very very very long wait and don't come hungry. What? Don't come hungry when you're coming out to eat breakfast? Exactly! Wait time may be 2-3 hours so please do yourself a favor and snack or eat light before you come. So what tempted a Tempe girl to come out to Phoenix to eat at Matt's Big Breakfast...Triple D DUH! Haha...Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives with Guy! He's the man! Who doesn't love him? I'm sure many people are stalking his eating stops. So cool, they have his face stenciled on the wall.   Okay, so you get here and it's so teeny tiny that there's just a little stool with a waiting list. Write your name down and feel free to take off for a bit. Walk around downtown...bring board games...don't plan on just waiting outside because #1. There may not be anywhere to sit and #2. Your bottom will be very sore from sitting so long. This restaurant is in an old lobby of an old motel. You know, the old motels with the little detached lobby the size of a one car garage. I would not recommend bringing a group here...they will not be able to fit you. If you're not up for the experience but would like to try the food, they do have carry-out as an option and it will probably only take 15 minutes or so. Once you finally get seated you can't help but wonder, how oh how do these people work in this tiny room all day? Man! It is t-i-n-y! Okay, so now that I have stressed how small this place is (tiny) lets move on. :-) I ordered what Guy ordered, The Chop and Chick. A pork chop with eggs. It comes with toast and your choice of hash browns or home fries. The chop was smaller, not life changing, but very tasty...it had great seasoning. Only $8 too. Home fries were a five out of five. Very good! No soda machine here...they sell RC Cola by the can though. $1.25 a can...My Dad had the griddle cakes and he said that they were the best pancakes he's ever had. So funny because we talked to a waitress and she said it's just a regular batter but my dad is a pancake connoisseur and he loved them! Overall, yummy food, great prices but the wait is just way too long to make this a regular spot. I would eat here again but would definitely take it to go...maybe even eat outside where everyone's been waiting for hours."}
{"text":"I heard about this place not to long ago and decided to give it a try.  It was packed, so the wait was pretty long but it worth it.  The fresh squeeze OJ is awesome but be ready to drink some thick pulp. I like it but I'm sure it can be a shock for the american taste of the shitty artificial juice that they have us so used to.  The waffle was pretty good. The bacon was crisp and full of flavor.  I ordered eggs with the rosemary fries and bacon. Those fries worth the trip!  Cheers!  PS Great service"}
{"text":"These guys ain't kiddin about breakfast, Me and my lady's first time trying out Matt's. I had the biscuits sausage and gravy with house potatoes( mmmmmmm it was good and well portioned) my lady tried the Belgium waffle with bacon(it looked delicious). Definitely coming back to try a different breakfast special.."}
{"text":"I travel to Phoenix often and after several attempts to bypass long lines, I was able to get seated after a 20 minute wait. With that said, dishes with eggs and home fries were excellent. The chops were dry and not really flavorful. We sat at the counter and the service was efficient without feeling rushed. I liked this place, but the wait and the metered street parking doesn't make this a very convenient option for a weekday breakfast."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! One of the best breakfast experiences I've had in my travels to Denver. Awesome atmosphere and amazingly fast service (serving hot, fresh food)! Run, don't walk. Get in line!"}
{"text":"We came here based on good Yelp reviews. Delicious fresh and great. I am not a big breakfast fan so for me to be psyched is unusual. The restaurant is darling with exposed brick and utilitarian pendants. They moved down a block last year to accommodate the crowds.   We sat at the breakfast bar and enjoyed a fabulous breakfast. I had a cheddar omelet with mushrooms and sourdough bread. The former was cheesy and exceptional The toast was served with marvelous fresh apricot preserves. My dining mate raved about his home fries (with fresh rosemary) and the special which was a ham scramble with fresh jalapenos. Both were winner choices.     Our server was really efficient and rather mesmerizing to see her take care of dozens of people with apparent ease. Watching her whisk around, felt like I was watching a lava lamp while waiting for breakfast, I am dinging a star because the place is really loud. Also my bottom kept sliding off the half dollar size bar stools. Noticed the ASU kids didn't seem to have that problem.     We will definitely return.  Thanks Yelpers"}
{"text":"The best airport breakfast I've ever had. Free range eggs, house made home-fries and thick cut bacon- delicious!! You can order to - go if you don't have time to sit down and be waited on . My to-go order was quick!"}
{"text":"Would you like some food with your butter? ------------------------------ Finally made my way down to Matt's Big Breakfast with some friends. We got there at about 10:30 and waited about 10 minutes for a table for 3, so that was pretty good, considering how small the place is.  The cute and feisty waitress got us all coffee, plus I got the OJ (Sarah K's review was spot on - it really is a tiny glass with half of it pulp). I ordered the cheese omelette with mushrooms & sauteed onions, sided with home fries and wheat toast. My friends got the hog & chick and a cheese omelette, both with well-done hash browns. We then ordered a plate of griddle cakes to split three ways.   The food soon was laid in front of us. All I can say is, I hope you like butter. Because butter was everywhere. I came prepared though, armed with my quiver of Lactaid pills. So bring it on, Matthew. I'm ready.  The food was great. Omelette was perfect and the home fries, seasoned with rosemary, were excellent. The griddle cakes were perfect for me, since I'm a big fan of the real maple syrup and light, fluffy flapjacks. My friends were fans of their hash browns, completely crisp and crunchy on the outside, and runny with butter on the inside. I'd never seen hash browns like this before, but I took a biteful to see for myself and the verdict? Really, really good. My friends enjoyed their meals, and our coffees and water were always being refilled, which was a great plus, along with our ongoing bantering with the waitress.   Definitely a great place to start off your Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Excellent food! A Great little Place to eat breakfast at! Service was excellent and would dedimitely come back again! =)"}
{"text":"The food's great. The pork products are amazing. The owner has a line on the best around. My gripes: the crowded conditions, the wait and, occasionally, the service, which seems to suffer because of the crowd. Two times now I've had to pull a Shirley McClaine in \"Terms of Endearment\" (think hospital scene and an ailing daughter needing pain medication) to get my coffee refilled even once. If Matt's has space, and that seems to occur only at opening, I'll slide in and enjoy. But I'm not going to get sunstroke for it, as great as the food is (and it is great)."}
{"text":"Nothing but fat and grease! EEEK.   Griddlecakes are great, however... everything else comes with fat, cut from fat. I'm sure it's good, just not my thing.   BTW, be prepared to wait, and wait, and wait some more for a table. Come in with a bag of snacks if you're really starving and ready to eat.   P.S. did I mention the wait??! YES!"}
{"text":"Sorry Matt, this was my third visit and became ILL from the FOOD.  I had brunch around 11am with my wife and brother. My brother and I both ordered the same item \"French Toast\",  1-1/2 hours later he and I experienced the same VERY ILL STOMACH!  Oh, one other suggestion, every movement in your establishment creates a decibel of sound.  Now add that up to a full house times a thousand movements...well you get the picture. I suggest sound abatment at least on the ceiling that way you could keep the character of the interior and serve your patrons best. Well that's my 2 cents worth."}
{"text":"Definetly 5 STARS. Matts BB is my favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix, in the world really. I'm definitely not a regular there but they know me by name. Even the owner, Matts wife, know my name.... Very cool. Everything is great, my favorite is the waffles with real maple syrup, huge bacon, and toast. With either coffee or RC Cola in a CAN.    It may take awhile to  get in, but I promise you... Well worth the wait, it's funny because nobody in the line complains, because they know...."}
{"text":"If you're craving breakfast food Matt's BIg Breakfast is a must. Probably the best bacon I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The service was great but the pancakes and eggs were cold upon arrival. This was the airport location so maybe there's something to be said for that but the cold food didn't excite my early morning experience."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off day.  Saw it featured on Food Network a while back so we drove from Queen Creek to give it a try. Was not worth the drive or the wait to get in. Very disappointing. Was nothing like what the show aired."}
{"text":"The Cobb salad used wilted lettuce, and was served minus the bacon. The tuna sandwich was all bread and a pathetic excuse for tasty.   Matt needs to eat his own food once in while.  Don't waste your time and go to Wendy's next door."}
{"text":"Been on a run of DDD joints this week while PHX area.. so caught early breakfast at Matt's BB in sky harbor .. got the big breakfast and while I would not say any one thing was the best I ever had every item on the plate would rank in the top 3.. and everything is fresh homemade .. very unique in an airport. While just like everyone else I could discuss unique homegrown and homemade artisan bacon, one of the best pancakes ever . I have to say I wanted to order more of the breakfast sausage and take it home with me on the plane.. if I had a cooler would have filled it up.  My grandfather would butcher his on pigs. And make his own fresh sausage the flavor and perfect taste I had missed for 50 years. Matt's breakfast sausage was the perfect replica. I will be back ever chance I get when going thru Sky harbor airport . MattsBB thanks for taking me back to one of my favorite childhood memories ."}
{"text":"We were 50/50 on this one. I hated my meal the salami scrambled, but Christina enjoyed her St Louis special.  If I went back would stick w/ the waffle. Very small place cant say I would wait an hour to eat here."}
{"text":"if u want awsome pancakes... then come here.. but,get ready to wait for a table,and wait outside in the heat for 40mins!!! but,worth all the wait!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite \"go-to\" places for breakfast in the area. The waffles are outstandingly delicious! I love the atmosphere, very open and airy. The staff is super friendly and they seem to truly care about providing a good service. I love the location in the very modern Marina Heights Business district and also being close to the lake. I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"My party of 7 only had about 15 minute wait. Cute atmosphere!   Loved the the window bar seating area. We ordered chop & chip, butter burger, the chili and the chicken breast sandwich.  The chicken breast was delicious. Pesto seasoned just right on a soft bun and very filling. The chip and chop was also good but the portion size left you wanting more.  The butter burger patty was cooked to order and very filling. The chill was amazing!! The bummer was that it was served warm. They had a yummy blue raspberry lemonade. The service was quick and friendly except our waitress who looked like she was pissed.  Not a friendly person at all. The bus boy should be promoted to waiter he had the perfect personality.  All in all it was a good experience and I would have given it 5 stars if our waitress was better."}
{"text":"That moment when you wonder who this person is that didn't give this place 5 stars? Perfect, thank you"}
{"text":"Pretty near the Heard Museum and the Phoenix Art Museum, I found Matt's accidentally while curiously driving around this little hipster/artsy pocket of Phoenix. We got there at 2pm when they close at 2:30 and I was really happy to get my afternoon breakfast fix while visiting town for a mini-vacation with my mom. Luckily it was not packed at all at this time on a weekday and they were happy to fit us in before closing.  We both got a daily special egg scramble which was really tasty with chorizo, jalapenos, and aged cheddar. I loved the home fries, though if I'm being nitpicky mine were a little burnt in spots and the rosemary would have been nice chopped up finely instead of big sprigs. Overall, the plate was very oily and greasy and it was definitely something I could whip up at home but it still hit the spot. I appreciate a relaxed diner that uses fresh and less-processed ingredients. Also, fun fact: in Phoenix unlike Portland or San Francisco, the waitstaff at a hipster diner are blond, tan, and in great shape. Everyone was extremely nice and we left to a literal chorus of \"Bye! Thank you! Have a great day!\""}
{"text":"This place is my favorite breakfast place in Arizona. The food is delicious and made with high quality ingredients, the atmosphere is perfect, and the service was prompt and friendly.   If you like breakfast, you'll love Matt's Big Breakfast. 12/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Very nice experience.  We went about 1:30pm and there were no crowds to worry about.  Staff was very attentive and friendly.  Waffles were light and fluffy.  My husband loved the special which was an egg scramble with roasted peppers and andouille sausage thick slices of sourdough bread and house made strawberry preserves.  Would recommend trying."}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix for Spring Training from Los Angeles, this was an amazing breakfast! I ordered the waffle and I'd say it was the best waffle I have ever had. The place was quite a wait, but it was well worth it. The service was fast and the waiters were very friendly. Food was great! I would recommend Matt's Big Breakfast to anyone in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great Place to Eat, LOVE to food, the area, the service is GREAT, Wish they were closer to me, or I was closer to them....  Thank You"}
{"text":"I read about this place on Yelp and made it my mission to stop in before my flight on the last day of my trip. I thought I planned enough time, but with the July 4th holiday, the place was packed! Being packed is always a good sign and since I planned my time poorly, I almost didn't stay since there was a bit of a wait for a table. Since I was so determined to try their food, I ordered my meal to go. I got the cheese omelette with provolone, onions and roasted red peppers and an oj. The oj tasted so fresh, it was like it was from hand-squeezed oranges! I waited a bit for my omelette and started getting a bit nervous about making my flight. Right about when I was about to ask about my meal (maybe 15 - 20 mins since my order) it came out. I ran to the car to take off for the airport, but not before taking a bite. When I cut into my lovely omelette, it had mushrooms! There aren't many things I hate more I hate than mushrooms and I was so disappointed. Due to tight timing, I thought of just eating the home fries and sour dough toast and tossing the omelette, but decided to go back in and see if anything could be done. The host sincerely apologized and very sweetly promised to make it right. I explained I was in a super rush and she assured me it wouldn't be long. My meal was out so quickly, and I was so thankful. This time when I cut into my omelette it was perfect and was honestly one of the best brunch meals I've had in a long time. I am picky, but everything was perfect. I really appreciate a business that takes care of their customers and treats them with respect - THANK YOU. In addition, in the time I spent inside, I could see the staff hustling and interacting with every single customer. This seems like a great place for the locals and I would spend every Sunday here, if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place, if you are looking for a great breakfast spot check it out. The wait is a little long at times but well worth it! Best pancakes ever!"}
{"text":"Matt's is my favorite breakfast spot. The food is amazing and you can taste the farm fresh ingredients. The only downside is that Matt's is extremely popular so plan on at least a 45 min wait during the weekend."}
{"text":"Great pancakes fresh beacon , and really good coffee !! They even gave us refills to go in to go cups !! Super sweet of them !! The black cherry homemade sausage was amazing and I'm not much of a sausage person but I loved it !! Only reason not 5 stars is because the wait can be crazy !!"}
{"text":"$1.50 for a thimble size of extra syrup, yes you read that right syrup. Food was very good, never in my life have I been charged for syrup."}
{"text":"It's one of those mixed blessings.. do you eat/sample at the Farmer's Market or eat breakfast here first and then feel too full to impulse buy from the market later...  But if I'm driving 1/2 hr from EV to hit Phoenix's Farmer's Market, then it is totally worth the stop here.  This place is an awfully darn good breakfast joint that sources from locals... the last time I checked:  Bacon -- the Pork Shop in QC Jams -- Cotton Country Jams Coffee -- C4 aka Cave Creek Coffee Company Breads -- MJ (drool)"}
{"text":"Never should have waited so long to finally experience Matt's Big Breakfast!!  My daughter is a flight attendant and was laying over in downtown Phoenix so I suggested we go to breakfast up the street from her hotel at Matt's. Waited outside about 15 minutes on a very busy Sunday.  As we entered the noise was extremely loud so conversation was not going to be the highlight of our meal.  But the food was so good we didn't need to talk, just enjoy the meal!  My daughter said the coffee was excellent and the OJ terrific.  I had the honey strawberry lemonade it is was refreshing.  We both ordered exactly the same breakfast, the hog and chick (bacon and eggs with home fries).  Dish was served with sour dough bread and fresh strawberry preserves, delicious!!  Our eggs were cooked perfectly, sunny side up.  The potatoes were to die for.  Tasty chunks of potatoes with fresh rosemary and onion, these are a must try if you eat here!  But the thick cut bacon was my favorite of all!!  Thick slices smothered in pepper and cooked perfectly, not burnt nor overly crispy, just enough where the bacon was fully cooked yet tender.  It was a bacon delight.  I'll be back without a doubt, still want to try the waffle with real maple syrup and more!  Great breakfast, thank's Matt's!!"}
{"text":"It's always a gamble when I stop in at Matt's because the line is unpredictable.  However, the fact that there IS a line should tell you that this place is pretty stellar.  Because I'm a creature of habit, I don't normally order anything besides the special or the hog and chick.  You really can't go wrong with either.  Every dish is made with high quality ingredients.  I always rave to my friends about how the spinach in the special was the most spinachy spinach I've ever tasted (that's a good thing).  Thick slices of peppery bacon = party in my mouth.  Their caramelized onions tossed with perfectly crispy on the outside but soft on the inside potatoes are also a different yet equally awesome party in my mouth.  What gets me every time is their thick slice of toast and organic preserves.  SO GOOD.  And a coffee mug that's never empty, that's always a plus too.  Matt, I don't know who you are but your breakfasts are delightful."}
{"text":"Our first stop in Phoenix and super happy we came here for brunch! Simple rustic little restaurants with excellent service and food. We were in and out of there in 35 minutes but I can imagine the wait over the weekends here.  I ordered their Wednesday's special, sweet and savory dish...french toast and apple pork sausage. WOW was the French toast fluffy and tasty! Best I've ever had and pork sausage was delicious.  Bf ordered The Skinny, basically an egg white omelet with spinach and apple sausages with a side salad. A very healthy choice and that's exactly how it tasted. Lol."}
{"text":"This place is worth the wait! Excellent food, fantastic wait staff, great prices. Totally missing out of you go elsewhere. Upgrade your breakfast to off the bone ham, you won't regret it....."}
{"text":"First, Matt's \"Big\" Breakfast is quite an overstatement.  It's medium at best.  They also have no reasonable low carb options and everything comes with potatoes and toast.  No creamer for your coffee.  Seriously?  I don't mean they were out, I mean they don't provide it to their customers.  Ok so I'll have a soda.  Soda machine is broken.  I had the pork chop and eggs, and the steak knife they brought was by far the largest thing on the plate.  The chop had zero seasoning, was undercooked, tiny and chewy.  All this for $13.  Rip off.  The young lady who served us was very nice; she was the only positive aspect of this  experience and I will go hungry before ever going back to this place."}
{"text":"If you like waffles at all, then you have to come here. The waffle is like no other waffle I've ever had. The real maple syrup and heaping of butter don't hurt either. The side of bacon is always perfectly cooked, and balances out the sweetness of the waffle.  The hash browns, lemonade, and fresh jam are also must-haves. sure, the wait sucks but if you stick it out the food is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Being in the Navy, I've faced two-hour lines for some of the worst meals our galley slaves can conjure up, since the other option was \"starve\", and walked away hungry. Back home in Phoenix, though, I'll happily pace back and forth for two hours outside Matt's Big Breakfast because I know in the end it'll be worth the wait.  Breakfast on a fall morning is a particular treat due to the presence of seasonal apple cider, which is phenomenal. Same with the blackberry preserves served with your side of toast. On my first visit, I ordered the day's special, an omelet stuffed with spinach and mushrooms, though couldn't help snitching from my mom's plate--she'd ordered the Chop and Chick, eggs served with a perfectly browned pork chop. The hash browns--my god. Studded with deposits of melted cheese that oozed out with every poke of my fork. Amazing.  I've only been once for lunch, but I can say without hyperbole that the Big Butter Burger is the best cheeseburger I've ever had. Cooked in rich creamery butter that calls to mind a particular episode of the Simpsons. BEST CORONARY EVER. I couldn't even complain about the presence of chips as opposed to french fries.  I really don't get the reviews dismissing Matt's as \"meh\", I'd love to know what heavenly manna these people consume the rest of the time"}
{"text":"So I had been wanting to try this place. But, I have always been in such a hurry when I am at the airport I had not had time. The plus side is ,it is inside security so you don't have to worry about getting through Security. Which can always be stressful. It is a very popular place as it is on the low B gates and there is a lot of flights out of that side in the morning. I came here with a friend from Denver after coming in from a flight. So we were not rushed. It is a very clean looking place. A great menu to choose from as well.  I ordered the Steak and Eggs, just a note, they do not do poached. So I got scrambled. It was very good and the steak was cooked just the way I like it. My friend got potatoes ,eggs , and bacon. The food was delicious and cooked just right. It was hot when it came out and it came out fast. The only thing that makes me give it 4 stars instead of 5. Was our server. She never brought us more coffee.  Seriously we had to ask 2 other servers for more coffee. Which they brought us and with a smile.  Our server Alexa( I think that was her name). Did not seem too happy to be there and did not want us to have more than one cup of coffee.  The bright side is, Food is great, place is clean, and most all the other servers are awesome."}
{"text":"We heard about this from a friend and when I did a google search to find it I came across a video clip from \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" on Youtube. They made it look yummy so I took my hubby there one weekday morning last week. The parking lot was full and there were about 6 people waiting outside. Take a timetravel trip back to the 40's or 50's...there is an old motel and attached to it is this little, TINY diner. You walk up to the door and add your own name and # in party to the paper on the cart by the front door. Find a seat on a bench, if you can. Oh, if you have to park on the street because the lot is full bring some quarters because the spaces are metered.  We waited about 15-20 minutes. When you go in there is a counter and tables for two around the outside wall. There is at least 1 table for 4 in the back.  I wanted to go here because they claim that they use all fresh ingredients \"No freezer or microwave\" and they use organic when possible. I saw the eggs being delivered and they were regular, not organic. When we were seated the waitress was right there to take our order. Since it was the first time we had been there we were a little slow, felt pressured because they want to turn the tables in this 7 top restaurant.  My hubby and I both ordered the \"local, organic apple cider\" at $3.95 per glass. It was an 8 oz glass so I felt that was steep! He ordered the bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast. The eggs were perfect, the bacon was limp- he asked for extra crisp, but it tasted good. The hash browns were a very large serving and crisp on the outside but very creamy, mushy on the inside, tasted good. The bread was homemade, 2 thick slices of cranberry walnut and he enjoyed it.  I ordered the waffle. It was a waffle, sprinkled with powdered sugar- which I can't stand and served with warm maple syrup. It came with 2 large slices of pepper bacon. It was all good, but with all the hype I was expecting more.   I saw a woman at the counter eating what I thought was eggs benedict so I asked the waitress. She said it was but that they had just run out! Boo hoo! I would have really enjoyed that! She said it is their special every Thursday and to come back. Now, I checked the website before we went and did not see this special or any others. If it is a weekly special I don't understand why it isn't on the website so people know.   I had to visit the ladies room. Now I have been to some out of the way places but this was really odd! You have to go out of the restaurant, into the hotel next door, wander down the hall...you can hear a tv, there is a no vacancy sign. There is a small sign for \"Matt's customers\", turn right (into a room) the restroom is a unisex bathroom in a hotel room. There is no waste basket for ladies and the hand towel is a real towel on the bar. It was vintage and clean but using the same towel as everyone else is NOT sanitary.  I would go again if I happened to be in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"What Happened... Haven't been in a while and dreaming of Matt's, but was greeted with disappointment. Matt's to me has three things going for him... Great food, great food, and customer service. Well the latter is there,but the food...Got the special which is usually fantastic,but this time small portions and my home fries which are my favorite were cold and waxy. Matt what gives,the quality of the food just wasn't what I remember, I can only hope this was a one time thing... don't know what could've happened and you even went up on your prices."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here since it was featured on Food Networks Diners, Drive-Ins& Dives. Guy Fieri knows good food so this was the first place I thought of when my parents wanted to grab breakfast in Phoenix. Luckily, on a Monday afternoon, we avoided the rush, and only waited 5 minutes! Score! Now on to the grub.  A lot of the food here is locally grown, they use cage-free eggs, and they even make their own jam/preservatives. I loved everything we ordered. Pancakes were different- they are very sweet- no need for any syrup. The hash browns were very good, but very heavy- and a bit soggy (which I actually prefer). The toast is large, freshly baked, and served with real butter. (nothing beats real butter!) My pork chop was very tasty and seasoned just right. Also, our server was a sweetheart, very helpful and patient.   Tip- try the homemade berry lemonade if available Tip- call ahead to find out about the wait- avoid the rush!  Tip- as mentioned in almost all other reviews, this place is very tiny- not a good for large parties or the claustrophobic."}
{"text":"Little disappointed in the menu selection also if you order pancakes bring your own syrup. The 2oz you get will hardly moisten the stack additional 2oz syrup costs an additional $1. Other menu items were good."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I found them on yelp because I wanted a diner. I went her 2 days in a row. The food, the staff and the vibes were spot on. If I enjoy my food and experience I always come back. Hopefully when I visit Phoenix again I can have a good ole breakfast.  The pancakes melt in your mouth and are responsibly priced. The sour dough bread with strawberry preserves was the best. Organic eggs. I loved this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Matt's big breakfast since it opened up in that little tiny building. I remember when we could walk in and pick where we wanted to eat but that didn't last very long before everyone had their own experience and word spread fast just how amazing the food is and service has always been very pleasant.  I'm so happy that the moved to the other corner of the block for the larger location. The food is worth the wait  it's just to bad everyone else has to agree. If you are smart and a regular you can time the wait and do something else until you think you will be called next."}
{"text":"Four stars for Matt's Big Breakfast is high praise. I'm selective with my enthusiastic brunch recommendations. This is the kind of place that will appeal naturally to men.   Portions were large and lines were long. Even on a Monday morning at 9 am, we waited on a table for two seemingly forever before ultimately taking a seat at the bar. Judging by all the baseball paraphernalia on fellow patrons, Spring Training and the World Baseball Classic were clearly a major influencing factor on the crowds. Perhaps other times of the year will be slower? I can't imagine trying to land a table on a weekend.   As for the food, I liked my omelete but the hash browns were the standout. I am almost frightened by what must have been done to the hash browns to get them to taste so good."}
{"text":"Matt.....Hey Matt! Dude, way to go! Love the - Eat at Matt's on the outside wall. Decor is invitingly cool, service was fast and efficient. The food hit a home run, hash browns crunchy on both sides (hard to find anyplace that gets this right) thick cut peppered bacon to friggin die for, nailed the OE eggs and the WW buttered toast with what looked like homemade jam was amazing. Great Job and keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Been here twice ...and both times were worth the wait.  It is a tiny little place with nice, genuine staffers.  Both times I ordered their specials of the day...and both times...YUM!! One was a scramble with Anaheim chilies in it....delish!  The potatoes were scrumptious too!!  Do yourself a favor and check it out...if you can...go during the week...weekend waits can be pretty long!"}
{"text":"Above average breakfast and will most likely be going back. The waffle was wonderful and the syrup was real. Fantastic thick cut bacon. One thing though it seems strange to me that biscuits and gravy is missing from the menu of a breakfast joint. Very busy place however we were seated quickly and service was quick."}
{"text":"Want a simple breakfast without doodads and sprinkles? Hate when people come clapping by your table to sing Happy Birthday to little Timmy in the booth behind you when all you want is some f-ing breakfast and coffee? Matt's is the place for you.   I had the pleasure of meeting Amy D for lunch here a while back. I must say I was seriously surprised how simple everything was. I don't know what I was expecting, but this is a pretty straightforward breakfast joint. For my breakfast, I had bacon, eggs, hash browns and 1 pancake that was large enough for two. I washed it all down with their honey sweetened lemonade, which I thoroughly enjoyed!   So why three stars? First of all, a three star rating is NOT a bad rating. Second, it's breakfast. There really is no way to mess up a simple breakfast. I definitely will go back to try their burgers and maybe I'll boost my rating.   Matt's is A-OK in my book and I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Good food that gets to your table fairly quickly. The staff seems to work hard. Big negative- long lines and minimal waiting area (especially in extreme weather). My advice- go during off peak/non-weekend hours or don't bother (unless you enjoy waiting 60+ minutes for breakfast). I've been twice now and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Googled best breakfast in Phoenix and this place  popped up, saw Guy F's review from April this year and it was good so we gave it a try this morning. It is easy to miss because it is so small. It had awesome service, was very fresh and tasty but disappointed because they only have RC Cola ( no refills) and not a huge menu but overall it was good. The special was awesome with home fries, around $8, my son got the waffle ( only get 1) with 2 bacon for around 8-9$ and my husband got 3 pancakes for about 9$ as well. You only get a small amount of syrup so an extra side is $1.50 ( too pricy for 3 pancakes). Bill was $28.00 and I think too much for what we got. The food was good, had to give it a try. Would never wait for more then a few minutes to eat there."}
{"text":"This place is always on wait, but well worth your time. After being discovered by Diners, Drive in and Dives, this place is jam packed. I love their pancakes and peppered bacon. MMM...my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Yum!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum. The pancakes are the best and that peppered bacon is to die for. Go just go and you will see why it's the best."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, get there early! We sat at the bar and had a quickly served delicious meal. Fresh orange juice rounded out the home fries, eggs and pan seared chop just like on DDD!"}
{"text":"I am a big breakfast person. My day rises and falls according to the quality of the breakfast. Mat''s is one of those places where I am going every Saturday morning now. After you eat there, you have a good clean feeling instead of the gross Denny's greasy feeling after you eat their breakfast. I always get the Hog & Chick and man oh man...the best thing I love about this place is the toast. Sourdough toast and it comes with homemade preservatives. It is awesome!"}
{"text":"Visiting for the holiday weekend. Had to try out the place after seeing it on Triple D... Not at all disappointed- fresh farm to table concept. Even the most basic foods was perfect from the eggs to the baked bread. Thanks for the Triple D and Yelp tips. I'm glad we came- will come back again and again."}
{"text":"Not only is this one of my favorite breakfast spots in Phoenix, it's probably one of the most recommended ones I tell everyone to go to when they have family/friends in town.   My wife and I usually get the 5 Spot, this delicious breakfast sandwich that I could easily eat every day. Then we'll typically get the special and split that, so we're always trying something new and the special has never let us down yet. I wish I could say some of the specials we ordered but I'm bad at remembering things.   Yes there can be a wait, but it's always nice out in the morning, they have a great outdoor seating area and your in an awesome part of Downtown Phoenix. If it's Saturday morning you can even walk over to the Public Market and grab some fresh produce or goods of your own.   Once inside, service is fast, almost too fast. I'm always surprised at how fast they bring out the food. They have these small coffee mugs but they never get empty because staff is always checking on you. It gets a little loud inside but we're always able to keep up great conversation with our table of 5 or 6.   So great food, atmosphere, neighborhood and a spot we'll always be going to!"}
{"text":"I love Matts and feel everything about this place is IMPECCABLE. But unfortunately the small capacity seating and over an hour waiting in line ALWAYS turns me away.  Id be around more often if I wasn't wasting my weekends sitting on a hot bench."}
{"text":"We had a long wait for a table at Matt's Big Breakfast recently, but the food and service were worth it.  I had the Skinny, which is made with four egg whites and chicken apple sausage and comes with a small side salad.  My guy had the Chop & Chick, which is made with eggs and pork chops.  The food was really tasty, and the price was very reasonable.  We shall return!"}
{"text":"The bacon served here is something special.  However, this place not only has big breakfasts it also has big waits.  The waits are to be expected with such an establishment, but once you reach your seat... well it is not a comfortable one.  The seating is too hard and the set-up does not support a leisurely weekend breakfast with friends...  a yummy breakfast... yes... but not a leisurely one.  Nevertheless, give it a try and enjoy the bacon."}
{"text":"Food was awesome!! The wait was about 20 minutes, They gave us coffee and added it to our bill. ( we asked) The service is why I give 4 stars. It is super busy!! And I had to ask a few times for refills/ water... But that's expected with such a crowd. I loved the energy of this place and the atmosphere was positive!!"}
{"text":"DIVINE WAFFLES. I have had amazing food every time I have come. Except for the bacon..... unless you like pepper I would skip. Cool vibe, the wait is worth the waffles. But I have had bad experiences with the manager, very snippy and rude. The waitresses are so nice though. Would recommend for food not service ."}
{"text":"We went around 8 am on a Thursday, and we had immediate seating. The coffee was amazing. We had the eggs benedict, which were quite good and the hashbrowns were extremely crisp. I had the waffles which melted in my mouth. The batter was not salty but sweet. We were really impressed. Matt's has a tiny parking lot next to the building but parking can be a problem."}
{"text":"It was organic ingredients which is always a plus but I wasn't to thrilled with there choices or what we got. Not sure what the fuss is all about, might have to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Been to the location at the Airport, which was great.  Thought we would try this location, staff was friendly and quick food not so much.  Extremely limited menu hash browns were greasy and burnt.  Ordered toast Which was burnt beyond saving asked for new 2nd order came out just as bad gave up.  Going to I hop next time"}
{"text":"I'm partial. There is just noooo place better for authentic, organic, delicious breakfast and lunch items in Arizona. Love, love MBB's!"}
{"text":"Typical breakfast place, but I would recommend it to anyone! Food is delicious, the servers are usually doting and kind.   I know there are a couple locations, so try both!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I have heard all the hype over Matt's and just never thought to go, as I don't usually have the patience to wait 2 hours to eat.  Fortunately, the missus and I had this morning off together and thought it might be easier to get in for breaky.  The wait was about 15 minutes when we got there, which is nothin.  We were seated at the table why the window and were greeted promptly.  I had a coffee and we both had fresh squeezed oj.  We both opted for the cheese omelette with mushrooms and onions, I had whole grain toast and she had sourdough that was served with house-made preserves (the bread, I learned, comes from Wildflower Bakery) and it was soooo effing good!  The hashbrowns were magical, all golden brown delicious on the outside and soft and gooey in the middle. We also shared a waffle for a breakfast-style dessert.  It was very good and I will definitely go back for more!!"}
{"text":"This is another place I've seen on Triple D on FoodTV.  The breakfast definitely lives up to it's name - Big Breakfast.  The portions are pretty hearty.  The only downside to this place is it's really, really small and the wait can be very, very long."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon diner, had the tuna with potato chips and without the bread. It needed a little more mayo, but overall good it came with a pickle.   We did wait outside for about 30 minutes to get a table. They have a water dispenser with lots of ice and lemon wedges to keep you hydrated in that Phoenix sun.   Worth the wait, good hangover food. Only wish they had a liquor licence , sometimes momma needs hair of the dog."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast at Matt's this morning. Walked in and there was a bunch of people bustling around, but I don't think it was very clear where you check in. Hostesses didn't make any eye contact or greet us when we walked in the door.   Seems like a lot of hype for something that wasn't that special. It was all just simple food that tasted fine. It was a nice atmosphere, but very loud. If you are looking to have a good conversation with the person sitting across from you, this is not the place to go. Just tasted like breakfast cooked at home...except more boring. Moderately inexpensive, but probably won't go back. Service was great though!"}
{"text":"In the movie \"The 40-Year Old Virgin,\" there is a line they repeat often to Steve Carrell: \"You're putting the pu$$y on a pedestal, that's your problem!\"  Matt's Big Breakfast was on a pedestal. We'd tried to go there a couple years ago, but the crowd outside was always too threatening a wait. Then, in August, we tried to go, but when we asked \"What's the probable wait time?\" We were told, \"Oh we don't really provide anyone with wait times.\" The line outside was pretty long, and there wasn't really any shade, and with no potential end to the wait, we came to terms with the possibility that we'd turn into bacon ourselves sitting outside waiting for a table.   Then this morning I woke up at 6:30am on a Saturday due to insomnia and we said \"Hey there might actually not be a line if we go right now.\"  I just came back from breakfast at Matt's Big Breakfast and now I'm waiting for my heart attack.  I'd tried to find out what the big deal was about this greasy spoon so many times in reviews, and nobody ever gave a good explanation in detail of what makes the \"traditional breakfast food\" so \"different.\"  I ordered the special - which was an egg, cheese, onion and sausage omelette, with hash browns. Since it was our first time there, we also ordered a belgian waffle to split.  The omelette was more like \"Onion and Sausage with a side of egg and cheese.\" The sausage was giant sliced links, enough to feed an army. The amount of onion was not what I expected - it was probably two entire onions sliced up and thrown in there. The hash browns are a serving for 4 people or something. They're not sliced like ordinary hash browns are sliced - they're ultra skinny slices like angelhair pasta. There are a lot of really crunchy crispy areas of angelhair sliced hash browns which are tasty. Thankfully, they are not all salty. But what sort of human can ingest this much potato in one sitting?  I'm one year away from having been a vegetarian for 5 years, and I was willing to \"go there\" at this meal because I had to see what everyone was raving about, and I read on the menu that the meat is natural and grain-fed. Not free-range, grass-fed, but at least not corn-fed and hormonalized and antibiotic-ridden. Also, I eat burgers at Delux and Rokerij and I'll eat the prosciutto at Bomberos. So I thought, why not see what the fuss is all about?  It was a'ight. Not FABULOUS. I tried to figure out why this place is SUCH a big deal to so many. Maybe it is shocking to some people's palates to taste food made with real butter and real cream - people who ordinarily cook at home and fill their cupboards with the healthy substitutes of every ingredient. Or maybe typical people buy Kraft cheese or something, I don't know. The ingredients were definitely \"real,\" which is, I suppose, a big deal if you ordinarily eat Crap for breakfast or eat at Denny's. It most definitely beats \"Moons Over My Hammy\" for instance.  But we really missed Pallate, which really WAS the best breakfast downtown.  The bread they brought for the toast was delicious ... but it's BREAD. Most bread is pretty good. The waffle was uber fluffy. I had a few bites and said \"That's a tasty plate of diabetes right there,\" while I felt my blood sugar go through the roof.  Mostly, I really felt a lack in the vegetables department.   I might seem like a health nut, because of this, but trust me, I'm not. I'm a tall, big person and I eat breakfasts at Dick's Hideaway several times a week. It's just that at Dick's Hideaway I can have them substitute the potatoes for veggies (usually asparagus and broccoli), and substitute the meat in the breakfast burrito with avocado. I'm used to having an entire day's worth of greens at breakfast. I suppose meat, for me, is like dessert: I'll eat it but it has to be high quality, and it has to be really worth it. It has to be tremendously delicious, I won't eat meat for meat's sake. This was probably somewhat ethical meat, but it wasn't an irresistible herby or spicy delicious sensation.  The \"thick-cut bacon\" that came with the waffle was definitely thick, and was lined with pepper. It was good, but it was also bacon ... bacon SHOULD be good, it's hard to do bad.  I see the trendy hipster appeal everywhere - orange countertops, orange everywhere, down to the stapler on the counter, the 1950's signs that say \"Eggs!\" and stuff. Whatever. I get it, it's better than Denny's, and it's better than 5 & Diner. It's NOT \"The Best\" and it's most definitely not worth standing around outside in no shade, without any idea how long the wait will be for a table, like a sucker.  The chalkboard on the wall inside says \"Visit our bar The Roosevelt around the corner.\" I hadn't known they own the Roosevelt. I recommend going to the Roosevelt and waiting around for a seat there, where it's worth the wait.  I'm glad I finally went, to knock the place off its pedestal. Now I just need to wait like a month or something for my arteries to un-clog."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about this place at first. Reading through the menu, I flipped it over several times looking for the rest of it. It's a short menu. My belief is that if you have a small menu, then whatever you do make, better be good. And this was. I liked my breakfast sandwich- the bacon was nice and thick and the sandwich was big and filling. Potatoes had rosemary in them which I'm usually not a fan of but I actually liked it this time. Hubby had a waffle which I took a bite out of (of course) and it was delish. The prices are decent enough. Will return."}
{"text":"I am not sure what the big deal is. The food is good but nothing was spectacular. If you have to wait more than 15 minutes I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"So after we went hiking in south mountain park we couldn't find any place to eat that was open at 6:30 am! So we searched and found this place. It was absolutely amazing! I couldn't believe how great everything tasted! It was by far the best place we had for breakfast in our entire trip! I had the breakfast sandwich the brad was soooo good and soft mmmmmm. The thick cut bacon was to die for. Although they could've added an extra strip or two. And I had my eggs potched it was amazing I wish I lived in Phoenix I would go here every morning! I also had some seasoned potatoes with mushrooms and onions! Idk how they seasoned it but it tastes like as if it was seasoned with smoke sausage!!! And don't get me started on their lemonade!!! I had the blueberry honey lemonade! DELICIOUS!!!!! when I tell you you would be craving that as much as I am now!!! I hesitated getting it to go because that'll be another $3.50 but I had to it was soooooooooooooo good!!"}
{"text":"After an early/long drive from Anaheim to Phoenix, my wife and I desperately searched Yelp for a great breakfast place. Thankfully, Matt's jumped to the top of the search and we headed to the restaurant.   We were greeted by some friendly faces and quickly grabbed a couple spots at the bar facing the window. We were waited on VERY quickly and we both tried the Strawberry Honey Lemonade. That truly hit the spot after getting hit in the face with 115 degree weather.  My wife ordered the special, Eggs Benedict and I had the Salami and Eggs scramble. The food came out REAL fast and boy am I glad it did. Everything had that \"home cooked\" taste. The salami and eggs had that salty deliciousness you'd expect from a dish like that. The hash browns were extra crispy with the right amount of seasoning. What I'm still craving (12 hours later) is the fresh baked sourdough bread with the homemade strawberry jam! I could eat a loaf of that and be one happy (and fat) Yelper.   My wife's Eggs Benedict was also incredibly well put together and tasty. The English muffins were thick and crispy and the Canadian bacon was generously cut.   Next time we're in Phoenix, we definitely want to try out the lunch options. Great work!!!"}
{"text":"Will be back.  Good portions, terrific service. The food is well sourced and excellently prepared.  Best.Bacon.Ever!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, as advertised. Thick cut black pepper bacon was some of the best bacon I've ever had. Busy place with a bit of a wait, but worth it. Going to the Camelback location next."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. Just as good as Tempe location and just as busy. Waffle was outstanding."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Their specials are usually the best thing on the menu! The bacon is extra crispy and thick, which I love. The eggs are great and usually accompanied with sausage, cheese and whatever else you'd like. There's a jalapeño and eggs special that is to die for if you like a little kick in your food. The only downside to this place is that there is always a wait (30-45 min) on weekends to be seated. But it's worth the wait. Also, they don't serve mimosas but you won't care about that once you've tried the food."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! From the bottomless coffee, to the service, everything was great. The wheat bread, and home fries are amazing. Our server, was very helpful, and super sweet. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We were visiting AZ this past weekend, and decided to try Matt's based on all of the great YELP reviews.  After an hour of waiting outside in the rain, the host called our name and said, \"we'll be seating you shortly\" and handed us menus.  He then came out 5 minutes later and said he was going to take our orders so he could get the kitchen started.  When we were finally seated (at the counter - not even a table) our food was served in about 10 minutes.  It was good (a little greasy) but I would never again wait an hour for breakfast.  Also, they don't have a bathroom in the facility.  You have to go next door!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food and coffee. Their place has gotten to be too loud. We noticed that it can be so loud in there with so many people sitting and talking that we have to talk loud to be able to hear each other. I don't recommend going there if you need to talk to your friend. I do recommend their food and coffees."}
{"text":"Good Lord, is this place overrated!  Anyone from the Northeast or mid-Atlantic could name about 50 Greek Diners that serve up breakfast favorites with better quality, larger portions and much lower prices 24 hours/day! I feel so sorry for people in Arizona who don't know how they're being ripped off. The fact that this place ONLY serves Eggs Benedict on Thursday and ONLY serves steak and eggs on Sunday is a pathetic joke. There is NOTHING on their menu you couldn't get at Denny ' s for a much lower price. What you're paying for at this place is fake cool minimalist artsy atmosphere and nothing more."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent, delicious ingredients and well prepared. We ordered the waffles, salami scramble and chipotle sausage scramble. Service was efficient.  Coffee was just ok."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! My husband and I came here for brunch. The eggs Benedict was amazing."}
{"text":"I came in this restaurant at 5:50 a.m. there was probably five or six people that work here walking around. Every last one of them walk right by me pretty much did not give me eye contact nor even say good morning. One young lady walk right by me and walk to the other side of the restaurant to help someone. It gets so old coming into an establishment to give your hard earned money and just be blatantly ignored. Finally I asked a young Lady,\"hey, can anyone even see me here!!\" The Manager Desi walked by and asked was everything ok, I said absolutely not!! You have 5 people includifee yourself that saw me come in and no one even said good morning!! Not to mention everyone simply ignored me!! I told the manager Desi this is totally unacceptable not to mention I am an Airline employee, also I frequent the first Matt's Big Breakfast downtown for years. Then her attitude changed a little. Truly this is not a good way to start your day or to spend your hard-earned money for breakfast. I could not figure out what was so different about me ...I can only guess!!....after all that I had to ask for water, more Coffee, wow!!!!"}
{"text":"Well I have heard the hype, seen it on DDD and viewed the lines wrapped around the block. A few friends raved about this place. I should have taken note to \"who\" of my friends were raving about it. They tend to eat anything.  I will not say the food is bad. It is actually good. However, nothing that requires this much attention. I grew up in NYC and we had tons of great diners serving bkfst, lunch, dinner and late late night meals. The food is freshly made. The most impressive thing on my visit was the fresh squeezed o.j. It was perfect.  The menu is small and I swear they don't have a green veggie or fruit in that place. It is carb and fat overload. The portions are huge. But I know this is what some people like and what they go for.  I was bamboozled by a friend into going here. He suggested lunch and was paying. Of course I will be gracious and go where he wants to go. I guess a part of me wanted to see what all the hype was about.   I don't usually eat this type of food, which might be the problem right there. I don't get excited off plates full of pork, flour, syrup, carbs and more carbs. After waiting 30 mins or so I was hungry and decided that I will pay for the meal ltr by a kick butt hike. Well lets just say no hike happened. I took an extended nap ltr that day. That heavy food sucked the living energy out of me for two days. Ohh Matt your big breakfast was so not for me.   If this is your kind of food I am sure you will enjoy it. If you don't eat this way often be prepared to feel like you ate a ton of bricks the next few days."}
{"text":"Looked up great breakfast places in Phx. We checked out Matts. Worth the hype. The Belgian waffle with thick cut bacon. Oh that bacon! Cheddar omlette with roasted peppers and More bacon. Perfectly cooked rosemary onion house fries. The strawberry jam was just right. The staff was super nice and brought our food out in five minutes. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I was disappointed with my trip to MBB. Ever since I moved here, I have heard amazing things about this place and was so stoked when my friend and I came in for breakfast. I ordered an egg sandwich--which was good and I liked. But I also ordered a side of potatoes--they were covered in oil and an excessive amount of rosemary. The potatoes were completely inedible. When the manager came around to ask how our food was, he looked surprised when I told him the potatoes were inedible to me and had too much rosemary; he politely acknowledged me and told me he'd check with the cook(s) about it. When the bill came, I was surprised to see that I was still charged for the potatoes that I did not like and/or eat. I had to find the manager and politely ask him to remove them from my bill, and he did. It was decent customer service once I had to go out of my way to find someone, but honestly I don't want to go back. Not worth it when Phoenix is a city filled with brunch/breakfast places far better than this."}
{"text":"Met friends for breakfast this morning and was sadly disappointed.  I expected the 30 minute wait, but did not expect the over cooked eggs.  Now I did ask for crispy bacon and crispy hashbrowns and neither came out that way.  Maybe it was just a bad day, but I do not expect I will go back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in while traveling for work. On the downside, the atmosphere isn't great/comfortable, but the staff are friendly and the Monday breakfast special was delicious. If I were in the area again I would stop in, but wouldn't go out of my way for it"}
{"text":"Great food! Had the special scramble of the day. Husband had the eggs with bacon (which was incredible) and hash browns. Will be back!"}
{"text":"While popular, we were still able to get a seat at the bar pretty quick for a Saturday morning. I'm surprised it wasn't a longer wait to be seated!  The scrambled eggs were the best my girlfriend had had and my ham, green chile, and jack cheese scramble (their special for the day) was exceptional.  The homefries and hash browns were both fantastic and the toast was great. Probably one of the best breakfasts out I've had in a long time. Definitely going to go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Very concise menu for breakfast but covers most of the bases. The waffles were good but the bacon was fantastic! The scrambled egg special with chorizo was great. We will be back."}
{"text":"The first time I came to this place I found hair in my food. Which I was disgusted but since its so close to my job I decided to give it another chance. But this last time was horrible. I come in following behind me is a group of white people. I come to the counter to pay for my food. I called in my order and the waiter looked right over my head as if I wasn't there and proceeded to help the group of white people that entered behind me. Needless to say I walked out and wont be going there ever again. Which is unfortunate because they do have a waiter there that I really enjoy"}
{"text":"basically i dont give a rat's **s on what the majority say i have never been treated like this in my life! saw it on foodnetwork, we just moved to az a month ago from los angeles. so after a 2 hr wait and it rained.....we were seated and for $4 we get a teeny cup of oj fresh squeezed i might add. we get the waffles with potatoes and thick bacon. it was ok but not worth the wait w/ kids! i didnt tip her becuz she just acted snippy. but we spent $47 so oh well. she comes running out the store like we stole something! was everything ok? (loud as ever) nevermind its a crowd waiting oiutside..she says rather loud...u didnt tip my server i said lady get out of my face u actlike i didnt pay the bill. its gratuity and there was no gratitude. i said your millionares after that show ...damn b&^%$# i will never go back. i also disputed the charge becuz she has the nerve to add 4 dollars in the tip line that i presigned. sheesh!"}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on in the kitchen, but it shouldn't take over an hour to make \"scratch Belgian waffles\". Then I spectate other people wait in line, ordered their food, eat their food, and walk off while I'm still waiting for my order to go."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I didn't have great time here. I'll describe my experience and you can decide. I came in and it was pretty busy. Came on a Monday morning too. But by myself, they gave me a quick seat by the window. My server came and I was a little caught off guard cause she was really cute, actually all the girls that work there are really cute but this one had a big rack and was demonstrating her cleavage wide and loud. I got it, I know it makes her better tips but for some reason it just rubbed me the wrong way and I think I just got really bad vibes from her. I'm here to have breakfast not ogle cleavage. And this is a family place too. Yeah, I know, what does this have to do anything about the food?  Well, I got the hog and chick (with home fries) and ordered the strawberry honey lemonade. She said they were already out (it was 0900!) so I opted for the blueberry lemonade. Well my meal came I start eating. First, I kinda thought my eggs would be bigger, they're not, they're like normal sized eggs. I don't know, is it too much to expect extra jumble eggs at a place called Matt's Big Breakfast? I ordered the thick cut bacon with it and it's good but overcooked. The bacon's almost burnt, actually it is slightly burnt and I'm pretty sure that's the style here, look at all other pictures. That's not the best way to serve bacon. And I like my food slightly burnt but this isn't the best way to serve thick bacon. It being burnt takes away a lot of the flavor especially with thick bacon. It's almost a crime. The home fries, everyone says how good they are. They're not. Why? Because they're cut too thick. They're mixed with rosemary while being cooked and other seasoning which is awesome but because they're cut so thick, you taste more potato than anything else. It almost makes the seasoning non existent. That's not good home fries. Might as well just cut up really thick fries and serve them.   Finally, my server forgot my drink completely. Never served it. I told her as I brought her my bill. She offered to put it in a to-go cup but I declined. At this point I just wanted to leave. So the food was just ok but I think that server really put me in a foul mood. I don't know, I really need to go back and give this place another try. Probably with another server, lol!"}
{"text":"During one of our Spring Training trips, we stopped by here for breakfast on Guy Fieri's recommendation on Diners, Driveins and Dives. The place gets packed and it's a small little area, so expect to wait at least an hour. We waited for 90 minutes before we got in on a Sat morning...  Well worth the wait! Ben had their omelet scrabble special with spinach, cheese and sausage. I had a simple scrabble eggs with sausage. Obviously, I liked Ben's dish WAY better. We ordered a side of their peppered bacon, they were thick and juicy and DELICIOUS! Ben was in love with their home fries, the hint of rosemary really added to the favor. Their pancakes and french toast looked good too, but we were too stuffed to try it.  We are going back on our next Spring Training trip! Definitely a must try, but like everyone said, be prepared to wait a LONG time."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious but I have a question for you guys: why you don't put all those dishes from the special weekly menu on the regular menu? I really wanted those Huevos Rancheros this morning :("}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to eat in the airport and even though this place only has 3.5 stars overall I decided to give it a chance. I ordered everything ala carte because there was no combo that actually matched what I wanted. I had two eggs, a pancake, and homefries. Everything was DELICIOUS. The pancake was nice and thin and barely needed syrup or butter. The homefries were amazing and the eggs cooked perfect. Total came out to around $14 incl. tip which isn't too bad. I would go back again."}
{"text":"I've been here before and I did not remember, somehow, that the breakfast food here is amazing. The bacon and patty sausage are the best I've ever had. I'd describe the bacon as being marinated and slow-smoked under and angel's wing. It's that good. The eggs are perfect, the greens were delightful. This place was 5+ stars!"}
{"text":"Still our favorite breakfast place.   The airport just isn't quite as good as the original. But it's close.  The hog and chick here with the ham is just the best choice in town.  We keep coming back, if you can get in without waiting an hour it's even better.  A real gem.    Thank you Matt!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best brunches I've had anywhere. The servers were very knowledgeable and eager to share their opinion on what's best on the menu. Honestly, everything looked appealing. The portions are fair, the prices even fairer, and the food all excellent. My waffle with two slices of bacon was the best waffle and best bacon I've had. Bacon was thick, not too fatty, and perfectly charred. Waffle had texture and crisp. Real maple syrup on the side :) The special chorizo, jalapeno scramble was nice and hot and spicy! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Every bit as good as what you've come to expect from Matt's Big Breakfast but in newer and bigger digs! Team service never leaves you hanging, anyone can get anything for you and everyone is super friendly. The food is as good as the day they opened, still wish they had the green eggs and ham though! Will be back as it is closer and did I mention bigger, with a lovely patio to boot!"}
{"text":"The food at Matt's Big Breakfast is pretty great. I defy you to find a better omelette anywhere in town.  However...  I don't know why they had to go ahead and screw up perfectly good food with such terrible service.  Do not go to Matt's if you are thirsty. It takes forever to get your drinks and forget about re-fills. The waiters all act like you are bothering them if you ask for anything. The act like the good food gives them carte blanche to drop the ball on service entirely. Also - STOP using so much OIL. Yucky!  ***Edited on 10/07 to add the following: The staff at Matt's must be reading all the Yelp's about their poor service because I went back there today and they were really NICE! It was the first time they have ever been so attentive, quick and nice. And they were not just nice to me. They were nice to everyone. It was awesome! There is one kind of bitchy, slow, mean waitress who was not there today - so maybe everyone is in a better mood on her day off. I hope this trend of excellent service at Matt's continues. It it does I will re-Yelp with only positive things to say. Except...still...chill out with the oil!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious food, cool vibe, friendly service. Amazing cheese omelette..their strawberry jelly is to die for and mouth watering waffles..even their toast was delicious! Highly recommend this place. I'm making it a tradition every time I visit Phoenix :)"}
{"text":"i have been going to the OG Matt's in Phoenix for years and this new location did not disappoint. attentive service, bright and open interior and food absolutely on par with the quality i have always enjoyed from Matt, Ernie and crew. grateful for a location close to home!"}
{"text":"I normally have enjoyed Matt's Big Breakfast, particularly their coffee. Had time before a flight this morning to grab a cup of coffee after making the trek from gate C. Stood in line at Matt's Takeaway only to be told I could not purchase the plain, black coffee I have always been able to enjoy when sitting down for breakfast at their airport location. This seemed odd to me, so I clarified, receiving the same response without any explanation as to why this was the case. Seems odd to me they can sell only coffee with cream and sugar added. Based off of this, I can't recommend them for an early cup of joe at the airport."}
{"text":"*****reader note: i rate based on ambiance and yumminess of food. i never consider service in my rating (no matter how bad or good)******  Typical brunch place. Nothing special really. Come if you want something solid without cooking, but honestly you're better off saving your money and time. Food ain't bad just not worth it.   Food: 3/5 Ambiance: 3/5 Service: 4/5 (not factored in ratings)  Worth it?  Nah fam"}
{"text":"This place is your typical American diner. Great hash browns, their jalepeno scramble is super good. Fresh squeezed OJ and their bread with their home made fresh blueberry jam was delicious! I will bring my boyfriend here before I leave AZ."}
{"text":"i was a bit skeptical after reading some of the less stellar reviews. but i have to say, it really depends if you appreciate the small touches to cooking that make the difference between ok food and absolutely thoughtfully executed food.   for example, some people say the hash brown potatoes are just no big deal. but if you've ever tried to cook them, it's hard to get the perfect combination of crunchy on the exterior and soft-almost fluffy on the interior.  and this level of execution follows all the way through to the eggs, the choice of peppery bacon (often called millionaire's bacon in san francisco), and coffee.   if you have cooked breakfast, are not easily fooled by heavy buttery sauces, and look for excellent technique and execution, this place is worth the wait. so grateful to have found this in phoenix."}
{"text":"Awesome. Had the 5 Spot: egg, bacon, grilled onions on a roll. Also had a pancake on the side and an ice tea. Full of deliciousness. This place is truly wonderful. I'd be a regular if I lived in Phoenix. The Sunday morning B'fast line was long but well worth the wait. Clearly full of regulars."}
{"text":"Really good airport food. I've eaten here a few times since it has a great location amongst the American Airlines gates. They have pretty great food and the only comment I have is that the service is spotty. Overall I've had good service but the last few visits the tables around me have gotten their food first, even if it was the same as my order. All in all I will definitely go back, but don't stop to eat in if you have less than an hour to spend."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!  I am a die-hard fan of Robert's in Tucson but this is the first place that gives them a run for their money.  Homemade thick slabs of bread served with fresh strawberry jam and an egg scramble with spinach and havarti = breakfast heaven.  This place is tiny and I'm sure gets packed as we went on a Tuesday morning and there was a small wait but it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"Truthfully, I just don't get the obsession with Matt's. While the food is good, it is just basic breakfast food. Meanwhile, there are always ridiculous wait times?? Another Yelper cited Matt's as \"[The] best American breakfast joint in AZ\"--I've been here a few times and each experience is lack-luster. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong dishes?? I usually order eggs; any recommendations fellow Yelpers? What am I missing? Ha! Further, I preferred their old, tiny location, which gave them more charm than their new, darker location. Neverthless, it's not that Matt's has bad food nor does it have bad service, it's just not wow-ing me."}
{"text":"OMG, the best. Fresh everything, I was there when they were in the smaller building. But, still as good. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Today's experience was a little so/So, kind wasn't the greatest, come to Matt's breakfast if you want an overly packed restaurant with not enough seating, also get ready for a pretty plain breakfast menu! It's a basic restaurant with kind of high prices for something so basic.   Also embrace yourself for shitty service. The manager is a rude fat women that I'm my opinion stares people down as the pay to eat there, other employees weren't attentive, shitty service.   As for the food it was ok."}
{"text":"Passed through here with enough time for a sit down lunch...had the Hog and Chick with ham steak (plus an extra ham steak because it is just that good)  It is honestly almost coming to the Phoenix airport just to hit Matts.  I don't like potatoes usually but I will clean the plate with Matts potatoes, just the right amount of fresh rosemary and onion.  Great sourdough toast, delicious raspberry jam.    And the ham!   Just please do yourself a favor and get the ham.  This is what you think about when you think ham, salty, smoky, crisp and soft all at the same time.  Can't wait to fly through terminal four again."}
{"text":"I work at the State Farm building that is connected to this Matt's Big Breakfast and wow I am very impressed! The food is amazing always! And the staff is so friendly.. I am greeted with a friendly hello every time I walk through the door by either Daniel, Asia, or the manager Jason. Jason is always helpful if I ever have questions about the menu and Asia does a great job explaining the specials for the day. If I get a to-go order Daniel is always a big help! Excellent location! I keep going back!"}
{"text":"Good food but like the old location better. The metal chairs are very loud and annoying to listen to all the time. Food is good as it always has been."}
{"text":"Great cup of coffee, best waffle I've ever had, got there just in time to beat (most of) the breakfast rush. My husband got a steak & eggs special. I loved that their water glasses are recycled jelly jars, coincidentally the kind we purchase and now we will be using at home. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to go for breakfast. It is so delish however, it's not the healthiest food, so be advised. The wait time is usually a bit high but the service is super fast. From the time we ordered, it was only around 10 minutes until our food came out. My boyfriend and I would totally recommend this place!  From My Boyfriend: ...but he didn't even mention the real maple syrup you can use to dip your peppered bacon in, or the fluffy waffles, or the kickass rosemary potatoes with onions and butter, or the thick cut toast with homemade preserves! This place is truly special... just watch your waist line!"}
{"text":"Well known and busy Matt's is a fabulous place to eat.  Be prepared to wait but today we only waited about 10 min.  They are efficient and the food is so good.  I've only been here on a weekend and I have been to both locations a few times. No trip to PHX is complete without Matt's!"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE that I didn't have to wait on a Sunday for an hour to get me some Matt's. I will be back. Once upon a time in the original location I was quoted an hour & half wait. This time upon arrival I was told we don't give wait quotes but you've only got 4 in front of you. So we waited a minor 10 minutes & were happily eating in another 10. So we aren't early risers by any means so it was more like lunch time & the eggs bene was all gone. Sad faces but hey it's our fault for staying up too late. You know the whole early bird blah blah."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked pork chop with eggs and home fries, sourdough toast was a perfect compliment. Had to get the side of bacon, well worth it. Everything was great! Nothing much else to say but try it! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Perfect!! Order matched instructions. Nice, clean location.  And Blakey is a great waitress!!"}
{"text":"they have a few of the Matt's in the Phoenix are.  they are open for breakfast and early lunch.  food is good but sometimes prepare for a wait. Danny"}
{"text":"I was excited to try after all the hoopla. Seriously disappointed. For the price I had extremely high expectations. The staff & service was great...but my particular order was.   Well..Tasteless. I had the pork chop. It was dry. My potatoes & toast, burned. And since I HATE the flavor of rosemary...double whammy for the papas. I had a to go order so, my bad. Probably won't go back. I can get potatoes & eggs anywhere."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the food here.  It's all good.  Breakfast sanwich , the hog and chick, the butter burger, the list goes on and on.  All made with fresh, lucally sourced ingredience.   Darnell Dockett was in for Breakfast today.  Peppered bacon, and homemade preserves are to die for"}
{"text":"Not one to write reviews, but I felt people should know that this place isn't all it's cracked up to be. First of all, the menu is very limited and doesn't leave many options to choose from even for the simplest meal of the day. I got the waffle with bacon and I asked for strawberries with that. Instead of strawberries I received what looked like strawberry jam. The bacon was covered in black pepper-not very appetizing. The service was okay, but I couldn't tell you who my server was as three different people greeted me, served my food, and took my check. Overall, not the best breakfast place in town. I would much rather go elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"Ehh it was ALRIGHT ! The honest were very nice. I chose this place because of the what seemed great prices, then when I started ordering I realized it's one of those places that charge you for every little thing. I got charged an additional $1.50 JUST for some syrup. Like you're a breakfast spot cmon who does that? And if you're a syrup lover like me it's kind of a big deal. I'd probably go back but VERY rarely"}
{"text":"Salami scramble--that is all.   (Chicken sausage is just OK... don't go healthy here--get the bacon.) Rosemary home fries are crispy and made with so much butter it hurts (in a good way).  Sourdough bread is thick cut and buttered served with amazing homemade strawberry preserves. I seriously could have this for breakfast everyday.  So sad we don't live in AZ... this place is totally worth the hype."}
{"text":"The Matt's Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix is much better than the Airport location.  The service at the Downtown location is faster and friendlier, and the portions more generous.  Our bartender/waiter at the airport looked like he hated his life. Never smiled once and wouldn't make eye contact or speak at an audible level when he talked to you... it was actually kind of amusing to my husband and I.  The people sitting next to us were vocal about his poor manners/service, but we just wanted some bacon so we got over it and managed to laugh about it.  I got the Hog and Chick; the potatoes here were not as crispy here, but it's all the same locally sourced ingredients for sure.   (Seemed like it was a smaller kitchen but the restaurant had more seating than other locations, so maybe they were rushing the cook on the food? We waited about 30 minutes for our food from the time  we ordered.) Overall 3 out of 5 as the service had major issues, the dining room was crammed (my legs  and elbows were touching the stranger next to me), but the taste was just as good as the other locations."}
{"text":"Great Service Great Food !!!   We Tried this place for the first time. On Thursday morning around 7:30a.m. we were seated right away. Great menu selection. Large biscuits, very good food, large portions. The food came out accurately, quickly and hot. We were in and out in 30 minutes!  Ask for Skye she friendly and a great waitress.  Also, nice and clean dining area."}
{"text":"Such a surprise to find wonderful food at an airport! The homemade strawberry jam is the best! The sourdough toast is thick and delicious. The staff is great. Cannot day enough good about this place. Will come here anytime I am at Sky Harbor!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice breakfast spot. Went here at around 10:30am and it was busy, but not packed. Waitress came to me right away for drink order and gave me the special of the day. I ordered it. It was delicious and came out pretty quickly as well. Menu options are pretty typical breakfast. I contemplated the salami egg scramble but was worried about quantity. I did not really browse the lunch side but looked to have burgers, sandwiches and salads. It's a consistent good place to eat. Last time I was here was a few years ago at the downtown location."}
{"text":"After all the hype I've heard for Matt's I was underwhelmed and left hungry. The service is quick and friendly. The strawberry jam is delish, I honestly would just want to come back to buy jam if they sold it by itself. Otherwise there are plenty of places in the valley that can also pride themselves on great ingredients without the long wait time or uncomfortable dining room."}
{"text":"I just made my final visit at this location. I ordered about month ago, I called in and when I came to pick it up, I saw there was only about 6 people in the restaurant but I waited to get my breakfast I had called in 20min earlier... The girl was nice about it so I wrote it off. BUT today was unacceptable. I called in my order and was told 15 min, I came in and my food was waiting, while waiting 2 older gentlemen came in and right after them a group of 6 came in. The manager came up, gave the other guy waiting his to go order and grabbed her clip board to help the people who walked in 4 min after me.  I would really hate to think that is was because I am a black women and everyone else was caucasian, but that what it felt like. I asked the manager after she looked past me to talk to the man standing next to me, \"is someone one going to help me, I've been waiting and I need to get back to work?\". She said \"Oh we just have some many people, I'm sorry\". Not genuine at all and after leaving the parking lot and attempting to go to the ATM I noticed I didn't have my debit card. I had to go back and the same women was at the counter and when I told her she didn't give me my debit card she explain to me where she had laid it down with my receipts to sign, well she pointed to the right of the register when I actually signed on the left and she had every excuse to get me out of there.  Its really unfortunate that people are rude and discriminate against loyal customers. I will continue to visit the semi-org Matt's on 1st st but this location has lost my business and I will not refer any of my colleagues or friends here. The food is good but not enough for me to be treated like a second class citizen, my money is the same color as everyone else's, she didn't have a problem with taking it."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and got more than I was expecting. The portions are really big and everything is delicious. I had an omelette with cheddar, mushrooms, sausage, their home fries, and wheat toast. Their home fries have a great flavor and I love that they use rosemary. My husband got the French toast special and a side of bacon. I didn't care for the sausage that came with the French toast and it didn't taste like the sausage in my omelette.   I also suggest getting coffee. Their coffee is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"I went with my friend on a Saturday morning between 730-8am upon her recommendation of amazing pancakes. She ordered Pancakes and My order was for The Hog & Chick breakfast, that came with 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, 2 slices of bread and potatoes with herb. Bacon slices were nice and thick and pancakes tasted great as well. Looking at their menu, there is not much of it. Breakfast from the looks, was pretty mediocre. Their homemade Blueberry jelly was amazing, right amount of sweet and tasted very light. In my opinion, the prices are high for the amount of food. Service was great, couple servers passed by, always filling our coffee and water. The server did not spend much time in asking if we had any questions but were quick with their services. Food came pretty fast as well. No problem there. The high stools were little uncomfortable to sit with trying to park the legs somewhere. It is a noisy place and i had a hard time understanding my friend until we started talking loud to make up for the noise. I saw the reviews of this place, i did not encounter any service issues. It is not a bad place, i would definitely go back but i will not go out my way to go back there."}
{"text":"Visited on  a Sunday morning around noon and they had line of people waiting for tables. We must have waited for about 15 minutes before we were seated. The girl at the front was very polite and professional. Our server was amazing and continued to check on us throughout our meal to make sure we were comfortable and happy with our meal. It was a second time for me and first time for my husband. I ordered Cheese Omelet (with extra mushrooms and onions) with the side of Hashbrown, Wheat toast and Blueberry jelly with some iced tea. My husband ordered the special of that day which was scrambled eggs with spinach and bacon with the side of Hashbrown, Sourdough toast and Strawberry jelly and their freshly squeezed Orange Juice. The orange juice was very sweet (little too sweet for my preference) but tasted really great. The server brought our drinks in 5 minutes and food came about 10 minutes later. My omelet was very delicious, hash browns were greasy, both jellies were great but Blueberry is my favorite, less sweeter than the Strawberry one. My husband's eggs were too salty. Their bacon slices are nice and thick and extra peppery. Their customer service was great, their prices are a little pricey for their Breakfast menu, if one ends up ordering extra such as mushrooms, peppers or onions for their eggs, the price can go higher pretty quick. Taking 2 stars away for making the food salty and for the price of items, limited menu, loud place. There is no presentation to the food, please ignore the zig zag of ketchup (that was my creation!).  They can definitely work on the menu, their presentation and may be their prices. Time will tell how much they really pay attention to their customer reviews."}
{"text":"Awesome local breakfast spot. Ordered the special and was extremely pleased with it variety and taste. Wasn't overly crowded and the servers were very attentive. Would definitely recommend and will return."}
{"text":"People in Phoenix seem awfully unsophisticated about the quality of food - especially for breakfast places. There are not many really good options in Phoenix. The Buffet at the Biltmore during the season is great. But you don't feel like going to the Biltmore every day (unless you live there in which case - why not?)  But to gush about Matt's Big Breakfast calls to my mind the one question?  WHY?  Seriously have you never had a really great breakfast place in your life experience? Apparently not or you wouldn't be so impressed with Matt's which is merely average at best, although their sour-dough toast can be excellent if it's fresh.  And their strawberry-honey lemonade is very nice, too.  But world-class it's not.  The place needs some serious competition in the Valley and maybe that would force them to raise the bar a bit. As of now, it's far too low in my opinion."}
{"text":"Amazing Bloody Mary with a slick slice of bacon, 2 chunks of cheddar and pepper jack cheese plus olives and a pickle. Not too strong but not weak,  a prefect drunk for a long morning! Loved the breakfast sandwich and the breakfast burrito with jalapeños, pefect amount of kick :) wish we had one in Portland Oregon!"}
{"text":"The visit to their Rio Salado location began with frustration. We stood around for 15 minutes with no hostess or waitress even acknowledging us. Because it's such a pain to get to this location, we stuck it out to finally try this fabled restaurant. I ordered the Friday special, basically a deconstructed breakfast burrito, and my lady ordered the hog and chick, sausage and potatoes and scrambled eggs. The food was okay, and the price was comparable to any other yuppie brunch spot that feels the need to advertise things like \"cage-free\". The mimosa was alright, but the Gin Rickey was made with a lemon instead of a lime. Overall they seemed under staffed. Will not be returning, but I don't think I'll need to. I don't think this place will be here long."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I came here for the sixth \"meeting\" of the Breakfast Club UYE. I might have to update this after going a few more times but first impressions were very good. I don't know what else I can say that hasn't already been said. This place has been on every \"watch someone else eat\" food show around and been reviewed a hundred times over. I am told this is their new slightly bigger location. It was very nice. We did have to wait until all of our party showed up to be seated. Which ended up being 14 strong when it was all said and done. Once we were officially on the list the wait wasn't too long and they had put together a few tables to seat all of us together. Due to the noise level inside the waiter addressed each end of the table separately so he didn't have to yell across the table. Drink orders were taken and soon after water and other drinks started to come out. Two people went around the table getting food orders. I had to get the griddlecakes even though the egg scramble with chorizo special was very tempting. I came for pancakes and that was what I was sticking to. Now I thought the food came out fairly quickly unless I was just caught up in conversation which is known to happen at the Breakfast Club. So many great people to talk to. My griddlecakes were awesome. Some of the best I've had ever. My one small complaint was extra syrup is $1.50 and I love a lot of syrup on my pancakes. But it was worth it because it was real maple syrup and the pancakes were so good. I finished off the entire stack of three pancakes which I'm told is quite a feat as they are big and rich. I was hungry and was determined to make it through. They didn't split the check but let each of us pay our share and in the end it was all taken care of. I will definitely be back to try all of the other stuff on the menu which is why this review may or may not change. I hope it doesn't because based off the pancakes alone this place is one of the best and deserves all of the attention and the line outside to get in. Can't wait for the next Breakfast Club \"meeting\"."}
{"text":"The food was good and the staff were nice. Not necessarily gluten-free friendly. No gluten free toast and they refused to substitute toast with potatoes, only a tomato slice (the tomato was bad). Their spices on the bacon were good but overall I would rate my experience as average."}
{"text":"This is a great option for breakfast. The service was great, the food and pricing was awesome! I got the waffle which came with bacon. Danny got the breakfast sandwich and thoroughly enjoyed it. Even the butter used for the waffle was yummy and I'm very glad we went here. One of Danny's favorite podcasters recommended this place and I am sure glad he did. The place looked urban and clean. Lots of use for wood and metal. I would recommend this place, they came around filled our waters and coffee often. We were also seated right away and got to choose where we wanted to sit. When we were leaving, it did look like there was a wait for forming. So try to come early if you can !"}
{"text":"We decided to try the place out after seeing it on food network's diners, drive in, and dives.  I thought it was pretty good but my wife did not like it becasue it was to greasy. she did not like the butter fat.  We did have to wait a long time to eat.  It's small and they had a lot of flies in the windows which was a big turn off."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to finally going to Matt's Big Breakfast after hearing about it for many years. I was kind of disappointed. My wife's pork chop looked good, but lacked any kind of seasoning. My omelet was OK, but could have been better. The hash browns were delicious, but the toast was to thick, and was hardly toasted. I think I'll stick with Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places out of Arizona! Any out of town guests I take them here for breakfast!  They have many options for being such a small menu. They support local business and even sell homemade jam!  I usually get the 5 spot sandwich! It's fulfilling and you get a bite of everything.  Definitely worth the wait"}
{"text":"Solid good breakfast at a fair price. Nothing earth shattering. I had a breakfast sandwich. Expected a big wait (that's what we were told) but there wasn't."}
{"text":"Often when you go to a place you saw on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives, to get anything that resembles what you saw on TV you need a camera crew and Guy Fietti in tow. Well, not here. The food was great and plentiful and the service was very friendly. There was a bit of a wait, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"We came into the place starving and ready to devour our food. But the trouble had started with getting seated and having to fight with a father and a little girl for our seats because they thought they were sitting there even though they never got seated by anyone. After that we ordered and ended up waiting 20 minutes for our food. I ordered the 5 platter plate (breakfast sandwich), it was really good. My cousin ordered a omelet and loved it. My sister ordered the salami scramble and it wasn't good, I could make better eggs. My brother ordered the big breakfast and ate it fast.The only thing that we hated was the potatoes. The potatoes in general were fine but they were sautéed in rosemary or something foul and were just nasty. The food was decently priced and you get what you pay for. Wouldn't recommend for a quick meal. Nothing special."}
{"text":"As far as the food goes it is absolutely delicious. I had the special which was a 3 egg scramble with asparagus, top sirloin steak and fontina cheese and it was very tasty. One thing I really like about this place is that they have fresh squeezed orange juice. I love fresh squeezed orange juice and it is rare to find it in restaurants these days - or at least at the ones I have been going to :)  The glass of orange juice was awesome but it was tiny. There is also always a long wait here since the restaurant is very small and cannot accommodate very many people.  I am deducting one star for the wait and the portions of orange juice, but the food was delicious - my wife and I ate every bite."}
{"text":"General rule of thumb: condescension toward your customers is never a good look, but if you're going to try it anyway, your quality better be damn good. Unfortunately, at Matt's it was just ok. Want half and half in your coffee? Prepare for a lecture from the waitress (who has been alive for fewer years than I have been drinking coffee) about how they only offer whole milk, but it's organic and you will be surprised by how delicious it is if you give it a try. Want salami in your omelet instead of ham? They charge $5 extra because the salami is \"really high quality.\" Never mind that the salami scramble on the menu costs less than an omelet with ham.   Sometimes there are really legitimate reasons why restaurants can't fulfill a customer request, but here it's just pretension. Next time I'll be having my breakfast at a place that asks me how I'd like my coffee instead of telling me how I should."}
{"text":"Let's be positive.  Matt's has the best waffles I have ever had. And the pancakes are pretty darn amazing.   But, Matt's has too many rules. Especially for a diner-style resturant. I feel like every time I go there, I leave being pissed off about something.  First, NO substituions.  I'm a vegetarian and most of their dishes come with a side a meat.  I would rather have a side of potatoes (and that is cheaper for the resturant than a side of meat). But, NO substituions. I have to order \"no meat\" and then pay for a side of potatoes. C'mon, now.   Also, NO outside beverages.  Matt's is located in an epicenter of amazing local coffee shops.  I would like to enjoy a handcrafted latte from Lola's instead of Matt's drip with breakfast - but the waitress will jump on your butt about that coffee cup before you even sit down.   Loosen up, Matt. It's a diner.  Awesome tip: Matt's does take-out orders. If you're craving some yummy pancakes on a Sunday morning and have no desire to stand outside for 90 minutes - call it in! It will be ready in 15 minutes and you can enjoy a local latte with it!"}
{"text":"What can I say??? Matt's Big Breakfast can do no wrong!!!  Delicious food and amazing locally roasted - ROC2 Coffee!  Now I just need to pick the right day for their traditions - their term for specials.....  Monday - Huevos Rancheros Verde Tuesday - Biscuits & Sausage Gravy Wednesday- Sweet Savory....French toast with               Schreiner's pork apple sausage Thursday - Classic Eggs Benedict  Friday - Special Scramble Saturday - Special Scramble Sunday - Steak & Eggs    There you have it!  Go and enjoy and don't forget to read your coffee cup!!!"}
{"text":"Why hello hashbrowns smothered in rosemary!  Stopped by here for a quick bite before my connecting flight and I literally fell in love with the potatoes. The coffee was strong and good but they don't offer cream and this girl likes fat in her coffee so thumbs down to that. Come for the food, not a service filled experience."}
{"text":"I have seen the lines here on the weekends and avoid the place but I drive by during the week sometimes and notice nobody standing around so I sneak in for some food.  The specials I have tried were all very good. I love the buttery hash browns. Mmmm.. Tried a waffle and it was great also. This is one of the best breakfast resturants I have tried."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. I wasn't sure what to expect. But we took a chance and it was delicious. The waffle was cooked just right. My nephew had eggs bacon potatoes and toast. The servings were gigantic. My niece had an awesome salad but again it was huge.   The place was a little difficult to find. You actually are turning into an office park. If you pay attention to the sign it does say Matt's."}
{"text":"This breakfast was so good. Split the special with my niece also split pancakes, all was delish!!had to wait 1/2 hour, but weather was beautiful and they have a nice waiting room/patio. Very big portions so share dishes if possible"}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly.    Food was just mediocre and not a big selection of choices.  Not seasoned well.  Major complaint was we ask for sausage on the side and they refused.   Not good customer service."}
{"text":"I've been twice, at the behest of coworkers who are more enthusiastic about the place than I am.  It's OK.  It's trendy and seating is limited (though better by far than in their original location), so it can get crowded and noisy.  Lots of nouveau-downtown hipsters with bedheads, nursing hangovers.  Food quality is excellent and features lots of \"natural\" options.  Service is hurried but friendly.  It's a fair walk (or a short drive, with ample street parking) from downtown."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot! The foods really served well and could actually accommodate a small customization which most Phoenix servers/cooks (somehow) can't. Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Matts used to be the place for breakfast in Phoenix, now it has spiraled down blah-over priced tooo hip not the great experience it used to be."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and I love that they had healthy options. I got \"the skinny\" which is egg whites, chicken sausage, spinach, and Gruyere cheese with a side salad. Huge portion and absolutely delicious! Pairs well with their homemade honey lemonades."}
{"text":"EVERYONE hyped this place up waaaaay too much. I waited with 2 friends for 1.5 hours. I got a Cheese/Sausage omelet with grilled onions... it came with a piece of toast, 2 eggs (I think), and hash browns.  People seem to talk about the hash browns... I don't see whats so special. Shredded potato that's burnt on the top and bottom, while hella soggy in the middle... is not my idea of damn good hash browns.  In my honest opinion, if you like A LOT of butter on everything, as well as waiting in line for a hour and a half, for a chance to sit down in a crazy small restaurant... then this is the breakfast stop for you."}
{"text":"First time here. I've heard great things about this place since I've lived in Arizona. Let's just say, my expectations were exceeded. The bacon and toast are out of this world. Add the simplicity of the menu and the local feel to the place, and you get the best breakfast in the Valley."}
{"text":"Ok so I heard that it was a wait to get seated but the food is worth it plus my homie lives on Roosevelt so it seemed like a no brainer. Aaawww it's true and it's a hot min unless u waiting right by the door when they open but that's up to you to decide if all the hype is worth it. I waited close to 40 min @10am on a Sunday so that should tell u. Im not fond of a long wait especially for a simple breakfast because basically I was just to lazy to make it myself. If it's eggs Benedict or some other fancy poached egg saucey type dish than I can understand but ummm no this is ur simple breakfast establishment.     So let's get into the meal;  Love me an egg sandwich and a connoisseur of these tasty impactful little buggers so of course I got the 5 spot. The bacon is so thick and amazing, the cheese is perfectly melted and the huevo was nicely cooked and is nestled in this locally made tasty roll that is so soft w/a pinch of sweetness. I give this egg sandwich a must pick up to go item and eat it in your car or walk home. No need to sit and eat there it takes to long. I do have to say that I think it's super wack home fries nor hash browns come with this sandwich and besides the bacon I can't imagine why pay $6 for a sandwich that doesn't even come with a side of extremely cheap veggie item, which is another 2.95, blasphemy. Anyways I ordered a side cuz my sandy was lonely and gosh darn it they forgot my order. Half way through my egg buddy I realized I still had no cheapy potato shreds in front of me. I had to ask and they still had to make them so u know they was rushed and a lil underdone. Mistake of the waitress not the kitchen staff, which was totally played off and they didn't even hook it up w/a free ice tea or coffee so they get a boo!  Nevertheless this place gets a whatever and if I go again it will always be an order out cuz waiting hella long for nothing wowwing is not the buizness, but if I do ima wear a side braid or bun like everyone else who works there as an ode.  FYI this place really deserves a 2 for long wait, forgetful waitress,  simple way nothing on the menu is to exciting hyped up eats but it gets a 3 only for the egg sandwich deliciousness only! Plus I can't seem to figure out how to get a halfsies ."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast places I have been, Had two eggs with a delic ham steak, hash browns. Add fresh in house made bread with home made jam. What more could you ask for?? Everything was cooked to perfection and totally awesome!  Mayor Greg Stanton was sitting at the next table. This is one of my favorite breakfast places, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Busy busy  busy. This place is very busy. Food was great. Hash browns were almost a meal itself. It is typical American. Loud!!!! To many people trying to talk over each other. So if you want to have a quiet breakfast you better look somewhere else. But all the noise ain't that bad for a great meal."}
{"text":"Short on menu, long on taste. A small diner, with a great small town atmosphere rules the morning meals.   I got a recommendation from a collegue who like me was hungry for a good meal to get the day started. That said a short walk from the hotel, we quickly found a place with a crowd surrounding it.   We signed in and found a place outside to sit and wait. Friday morning, 9 am, we waited about 20 minutes.   The tables are small, their glasses of orange juice aren't very large, however it was freshly squeeed from what I could tell.   We both had the special, and it was a nicely portioned meal that filled is both up without regret. Their fasted fresh, and it was full of flavor. It was perfect for the morning."}
{"text":"Its good if you like pepper, or whatever spice they use, on everything. Everyone there was nice and efficient, it's just not a place I would go again for a healthier choice. If you have no problem with carbs galore and sugar, minimal fruit and veggies then you will love this place. I did appreciate having an option for a salad with my breakfast."}
{"text":"I love that this place has free range chicken eggs in all of their dishes. My breakfast was delicious. They played good music too. The reason they didn't get 5 stars from me is because it's so loud in there because, unfortunately, like many other restaurants in Phoenix, they have a concrete floor."}
{"text":"What a great place for an airport restaurant!  My cheeseburger was fabulous.  The fries, however, were not that fresh.  But in general, this is the best airport restaurant I have ever visited."}
{"text":"So, it turns out the place should have been called Matt's Semi-Pretentious Yet Tasty Breakfast. Had the Chicken & Artichoke Sausage with organic baby spinach and Fontina cheese scramble, breakfast potatoes and rustic sourdough toast. Quite tasty... but not the blue spoon diner I thought we we're walking into with the name like \"Matt's Big Breakfast\". It was not a big breakfast. Coffee was slow to refill and waitresses were a bit inattentive. Food gets 4-stars, service gets 3."}
{"text":"AAAAAAMAZZZING!!!!! The best overall breakfast experience that I have ever had. Here's why:  1. Proper flatware. Not that cheap junk that overpriced , low quality restaurants usually use. 2. NonGMO ketchup 3. Homemade preserves for the homemade bread. 4. Myers soap in the restrooms 5. Waffles to die for with real maple syrup So much more but who wants to read all that? Matt's BIG Breakfast IS the best this fussy, Non GMO, organic, frugal, prefers to eat at home Gal has ever eaten!!!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best breakfast eatery at any airport  in America.  Try the french toast"}
{"text":"Went to Matt's for breakfast. If you are not a patient person, then I dont recommend coming here on the weekend. We had a 30 minute wait but its always worth it. The food is always so good and just healthy enough that you don't feel guilty afterwards.  We had a server (a girl with dark hair who is shorter with a higher voice) come up to us for our drink order and we just ordered the honey lemonade and asked about possibly using the chicken sausage as an add on to a plate but she said they had run out of the chicken sausage, we understood. We saw her walk away and start talking to someone else. We were sitting for a little bit when we noticed the chalk board with the flavors for the honey lemonade. The server never told us that there were other options that day. The manager (Jason?) happened to have walked by and we asked to change our drinks to a strawberry one and a blueberry one (Blueberry was AMAZING). He then got them changed but they werent actually changed because the server hadnt even grabbed the drinks yet (we could see her standing talking to someone) the manager came back (note: we still hadnt ordered) and we asked about the chicken sausage. He then said they never run out of it because it is a staple. So we asked if it could be put into the chicken sausage (which the menu says add sausage $1.25) and the manager said of course we can do whatever. So then the server  came back to take our order and then said she asked the kitchen about the the chicken sausage would be a $4 charge to add it to the omelet. We decided not to add and just ordered everything as is. I got the waffle, and my boyfriend got the cheese omelet. Both plates were so good and actually my favorite part was the sour dough toast. I understand that its a busy place but the place is small and its obvious to see when a server is standing around and on a saturday morning at 10am I cannot imagine why they would. The food and the management was good so I still wanted to give to my review 4 stars.  And keep the blueberry lemonade all the time!!"}
{"text":"Worst service in any airport. Order a beer and Cobb salad. I was sitting in front of the beer tape. Still took her  five minutes after I order the beer. Order a Cobb salad waited  25 minutes and it never came. She forgot to order my salad. Terrible service"}
{"text":"If you have two hours between flights I guess this could work.  Worst service I have ever had in an airport."}
{"text":"Just stopped for a quick cocktail between flights - awesome bloody mary and really nice staff."}
{"text":"Really good Breakfast.  We enjoyed the waffles and thought they tasted great.   We will def be back!"}
{"text":"No frills basic breakfast.  Hash browns were soggy and oily. Chop was cooked nearly perfect. Chop and chick, side of bacon, and glass of OJ came to $18 including tip, so it's a little pricy for a basic breakfast."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had in my life!!!!! Everything is organic. Great service and the food is definitely worth the wait. Also they make sure they get you in when it is busy."}
{"text":"Local owned, Local Grown this place is all the hype and more.  We ride our cruisers here for breakfast and even before we get in for work.  Why? This place has a warm feel to it and the food is AWESOME!  They have daily egg specials that are remarkable.  The Honey Lemonade is fresh and like no other in town.  It gets busy so get in early and put your name in the notepad at the door.  I would not recommend for large parties, because they are very small. Steak and Eggs every Sunday."}
{"text":"I was sooooo disappointed!  I really cannot rate the food as I never got to eat. I live in Tucson and my family is mostly in the east  valley of Phoenix and I have been waiting for 2 years to go into downtown and eat at Matt's. I go and put my name on the waiting list. Other parties of 2 come after me and the guy kept sitting people that had been there for 20-30 minutes and I had been waiting exactly 1 hour. What really upset me is that I saw him seat 3 people at tables for 2 and when I walked in said he couldn't sit 3 there when there were others seated that way (i think he knew them).  I am truly disappointed as I've been waiting like I said for \"2\" years to eat there. If you have a party of more than 2, like a mere 3, you'll wait forever!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch. I had the chicken sandwich and it was huge. It tasted amazing. This place is louder than normal but that food it great"}
{"text":"Super nice staff. Breakfast was good. Nothing earth shattering. The bacon was awesome and loved their toast. Good solid place for breakfast."}
{"text":"With all due respect if you are religious, but on a Sunday morning Matt's Big Breakfast can be even more spiritual than church! This is Phoenix's best breakfast hands down. The pancakes are so light and fluffy it's like someone took the clouds straight out of heaven and onto a griddle. The bacon is thick and satisfying too and the ham steak is just another level of flavor I've never experiences during the day hours.  Portions and prices are spectacular, but now comes the bad part: the wait is worse than vegas' best nightclubs. Just like vegas too, if there's more than two of you, you're not getting in. Best bet is to order over the phone, get it to go, and enjoy this goodness at home where at least nobody else can see you drool."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing experience! On the weekends they are very busy - probably about a 20-30 minutes wait, but it's worth it! I have tried the eggs and bacon, the Reuben sand which, and their scramble special with sausage... All of them were superb!"}
{"text":"This place is SO WORTH THE WAIT! Came here on a Saturday morning so there was a huge line and we waited for over an hour but your patience will be rewarded.   They do good, old-fashioned comfort breakfast food and they do it well. They also use local and organic ingredients and cage-free eggs.   I don't remember what my friends had as we ate there awhile ago, but I had the Hog & Chick. Bacon was crisp but not overcooked and was delicious! Eggs were cooked perfectly as well and the potatoes were crisp and perfectly seasoned.    Once you get seated you are well taken care of by friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff who are more than happy to help you decide if you're having a hard time, which is understandable given the variety of tasty options on the menu. They keep coffee and drinks topped off and make sure everything is cooked as it should be.   I have not had any of their lunch items yet but if they're anything like their breakfast menu they are sure to be phenomenal.   Definitely plan on going back now that I have most weekends off!"}
{"text":"Nice breakfast spot. Most importantly...THE 2nd BEST BACON I've ever had! Their thick cut bacon deserves to be on the Mt Rushmore of pig product. Absolutely worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"Been here twice and don't see the allure. Nothing really Big about the place. The breakfast menu is small, too small in my opinion. No gravy? What kind of self respecting breakfast diner doesn't offer gravy on the side? Ordered the waffle this time and it came with bacon. Waffle was a bit overcooked and dry... Nothing remarkable there. The bacon that came with it was absolutely coated in coarse black pepper...not my thing at all. If I want pepper let me add it. I think this place is just \"a thing\" because it's busy and has a hipster draw to it. It's just not really a great breakfast diner. The service is decent and quick however. Don't understand why there is always a wait. This area must be starved for a variety of decent breakfast spots."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place since it has great reviews. The host that took my name was rude and snoby. It was busy and congested. The menu was very simple and not enough options. We decided to leave and eat breakfast elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Food was good, tad overrated for that kind of wait. Guy up front was a little rude."}
{"text":"Long wait time....  and they won't seat you till your whole party is there... well, we were, but still had to wait.  I had the French Toast w/bacon.... VERY yummy!  Stole some hash browns from my friend's plate... love crispy hash!"}
{"text":"Not really sure how this place only has 3 and a half stars. They've got all the hallmarks of a great breakfast place (aside from being in the airport, of course). But Matt's isn't just good for being in the airport; it's good all around.   The service was spectacular, even the host who had to put up with a lot of attitude from angry people who didn't want to wait for a table.   The menu prices were decent too, aside from the alcohol of course. But the hog and chick breakfast was $10.99 and comes with all the usual fixings. This is more affordable than most brunch places nowadays, but it was stellar! The toast and bacon were memorable.   Next time I find myself in need of breakfast in the Phoenix airport, I will be headed to Matt's!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, very fresh. Good service, nice atmosphere. The wait can be killer, but if you have the time, it's worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here this past weekend.  My son lives in Phoenix  told us to try Matt's, that they have a great breakfast.   I had the egg white scramble w/sausage (apple i think?) with a small salad (which by the way was not a small salad..) it was delicious!  I loved it!  Salad for breakfast was delicious and fresh OJ.  Hubby had the steak and eggs and said steak was melt in your mouth.  Later that day we were walking around downtown Phoenix and happened to walk by, and line was around the corner!  Definitely an early morning option was the best idea:)  Thanks for a great breakfast!  Hope you make it out to Inland Empire area of California!"}
{"text":"New Location with way more space, they have a prep kitchen seating available via reservation if you have parties greater than 5."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, and I find it hard to believe it's in the middle of an airport terminal. The service was great. My boyfriend was crabbier than a crab apple since we missed our connecting flight, but the server was so gracious and understanding. I had the Bloody Mary and wawawewa, it put a lil pep in my step. Definitely one of the best I've ever had, from the garnish to the actual drink. I also had the thick cut bacon. It was sick -- some of the best bacon I've ever had in my life. Grumpopatomus had some kind of meat (pork, I think) smothered in onions and gravy and stuff. He said it was really good.  The price was a little stiff, but hey, that's airport fare for ya! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"I went here a little while back and forgot to rave about how delicious it was! I went on an Wednesday, and their special was French toast with sausage. I also tried the honey lemonade, and it was amazing! The service was great too, except my food came about 10 min. After the person I was with got theirs, but I can't control how fast things get cooked and I would rather have them serve the food warm than let it sit and get cold waiting for the rest of the parties order. The French toast was delicious because of the house made maple syrup and the great quality of the bread used. I'm not a huge fan of sausage, but this one was soooo good! The bacon though...was...AMAZING! Both of the meats had some sort of sweet glaze, yum! I loved the char on it...yummy. Definitely deserves to be called the best breakfast spot in Arizona."}
{"text":"Always crowded, but wait is not bad - and is worth it. Food is delicious and service awesome. My only \"complaint\" is that the host today was abrasive with snide comments."}
{"text":"Excellent service here. Large portions- great value. Strawberry compote served with the toast is great - and different.  Unexpected pleasure for breakfast."}
{"text":"Matt's has well thought out food (although not a TON of options), quick service, and a nice ambiance.  Even though the service is quick, the wait to get a table might be long.  This is a popular tourist and local spot but worth a little wait.  The coffee is roasted locally in Cave Creek and the Cinnamon walnut toast is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Wow. Best breakfast place I've ever been to.  Visited while in town for the Superbowl (boo Pats!) and this was one of the famous go-to places I found. We went and holy crap, the line was LONG. It took us like 30-45 min to get a table. I would've waited an hour to eat here though. The food was THAT good.  I started with the strawberry honey lemonade. Best lemonade I've ever had in my life. The honey complimented the strawberry lemonade so well, I could not believe it was not a more common drink. For breakfast, I ordered the breakfast sandwich and the cherry sausage. My Dad ordered the standard breakfast and we also shared a waffle.  The waffle came out first, so we started with that. Best waffle I've ever had. The flavor and crispness of it was so unique and delicious. I did not think a waffle could blow my mind, but that one did. I ended up finishing most of that waffle, when originally I was just planning on taking a few bites.  By the time my breakfast sandwich and sausage came, I was already feeling full, but I powered through it anyway. I got halfway through both and felt extremely full, but could not let myself waste such quality food. The sausage's flavor was very sweet and almost dessert-like. The sandwich bread was this giant artisan looking bun and the eggs, bacon, and other fillings were cooked and spiced perfectly. I feel like a broken record at this point, but this food was phenomenal.   If this breakfast place was in Capitol Hill in Seattle, they would put everyone else out of business. Our best breakfast places pale in comparison to this spot, and we have some solid breakfast spots.  You've set a new standard for breakfast, and I hate that because you are located so far away! PLEASE come to Seattle!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I've worked in the food Industry for 20 years, I'm not sure I've experienced a more friendly staff. I was in Phoenix for spring training with a large group of friends and our kids. We were going to an afternoon game and wanted to take the kids to breakfast first. We had heard good things about Matt's big breakfast so decided to check it out. The staff was extremely accommodating, offering plenty of different options for a group our size. In the end we decided the best option would be to split up into separate tables. The moment I sat down, we were greeted by a friendly server who immediately brought us a waffle. I explained that I didn't order one, to which she replied with a smile \"I know\". We had been having a rough morning after driving for 12 hours straight so this was exactly what I needed. Within another minute, the manager came by and asked if we would like chocolate milks for the kids. We ordered an omelette, griddle cakes, breakfast potatoes, and waffles. Everything was amazing. The omelette was made in the traditional style with the eggs cooked so perfectly that there was no brown, the filling were in the middle then dried out and cooked into the eggs. The potatoes were cooked perfectly crispy and tender at the same time. The waffle came with a side of delicious house made strawberry preserves. Thank you to Matt's big breakfast for starting off our trip on an amazing note!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for a breakfast to catch up with some friends. Food was phenomenal! I had the cheese omelette with some mushrooms and it was delicious, so were the homefries (although a bit too oily, but they tasted great). One of my friends had the steak and eggs and the steak was tender, juicy and tasty! we loved the food and the service from both waitresses that helped us since it was our first time there. Menu could be considered 'small' but you trade that for the quality of food served there. Be prepared to wait for a table though! the place is packed and busy! If your whole party is not there they will not seat you (for obvious reasons). They have a couple of benches outside and some shade from some palo verdes. Parking is free right behind the restaurant, but only a few spots, if you are lucky you can get a spot and don't have to pay for parking. It is downtown Phoenix after all. Only 'bad' thing, which is not a bad thing really, but it may change your mind depending on what you are looking for, the restaurant ambiance was too loud! Since the place is small and packed with people everybody talking (loud in order to hear each other lol). Food was excellent! Service was superb! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Slowest service I've ever gotten. I think they forget people have to get on flights. Be carful when you eat here you might miss your flight."}
{"text":"we took the red eye flight from Hawaii to Phoenix and needless to say me and my family of 5 were completely exhausted and hungry. fortunately we quickly got a table at Matt's and ordered right away. we didn't even have to wait long for our food and that was awesome because it was a long night and we were completely starving. I ordered the griddle cakes and they were fabulous. light and fluffy and the syrup seemed homemade. all the eggs are from cage less chickens. everything my family ordered look delicious too. would highly recommend this place and I wish they had it back home where I am from."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this local establishment for a while. We came before a diamondbacks game last summer so it wasn't too long of a wait maybe 10 minutes. We both had the skinny and both liked it.  The service was fast and friendly, We loved the coffee so we ended up buying a bag. You can only get that blend from a local toaster at the restaurant and it's awesome."}
{"text":"Back in the day we stood in line for an hour and a half to stick a fork in one of those fabulous, juicy, tasty pork chops and were happy to do it. Flavors were fabulous and portions were huge. I think success has meant a lot of watering down. A while back I ate in the airport terminal and had a bad experience which I attributed to the rush of dealing with airport traffic but the pork chop I had this morning was dry and tough here at the Biltmore location. My wife complained about her's as well and for the same reason.   She declared her hash browns average but loved the toast and home made jelly. I thought the home fries were fabulous with lots of onion and nice crispy brown edges on the potatoes. So good. The iced tea was great and the servers kept my glass filled so that was good. Other than the dried out chop, the food was fine. My real problem is that it simply isn't as great as it used to be. The experience is kind of like the candy bar as big as your head that you used to get for $.99, but now it is a third the size for the same price. You're not disappointed because, you know, chocolate, but it just doesn't measure up to what used to be...   We kind of decided it's not really worth the wait."}
{"text":"Pretty good place.. Service is quick food is well proportioned.. Just good old fashion breakfast.. Nothing stellar like others I have reviewed but just good.. Nice walk from downtown hotels."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here on a trip to Phoenix and it was to die for! I got the special which was a 3-egg scramble with cheese, spinach, and ham - SO GOOD. The eggs tasted SO fresh. THE BEST PART - the HASH BROWNS. Oh my gosh, I have never tasted hash browns like that before - they were perfect! Crunchy on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside - yum yum. The toast was made fresh (like my mom's), and was THE best toast I have ever had at a restaurant. Fresh squeezed OJ was dynamite! SO GOOD! Best OJ I have ever had. Even the coffee was good!! Great vibe - really small place so no wonder there is a wait. PLUS, I saw the workers give a little to-go box to one of the homeless guys on the street - LOVE THAT!! Not only does this place have great food and great service, but they are caring people!"}
{"text":"Today was our last visit to this restaurant. The first time we went was n a weekend, Service Good and the food was very good. We were hooked right away. BUT we have gone there several times in the last few months. Something has changed. This morning we waited for awhile to be waited on. Not many people there so that was a puzzle. Food came. Potatoes cold and GREASY with large springs of rosemary! Rosemary should never be served as large sprigs. OK for garnish but can be a chocking hazard. My husband ordered the Tuesday special.  I can make sausage gravy and biscuits at home that would be far superior to what was served. My eggs were also disappointing. Over Medium were almost hard yokes but still with runny white. Can't figure that out.  Never asked for a coffee warm up. Bye Bye Matt's"}
{"text":"The food is very good at Matt's.  I usually get one of the specials.  My wife always gives me a strip of bacon from her plate, and I must say, they have excellent bacon there.  It's a nice thick cut of bacon, which is right up my alley.  The service is as it should be.  No frills, but they get the job done.  That's all I really care about.  I'm almost never in the mood for the fake banter you get from chain restaurant servers.  There is a little bit of a wait, but people who are not originally from AZ are used to waiting 2x as long, so it's not really a big deal to me.  I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Breakfast, coffee and homemade orange juice? Any day, anytime!   I was so curious to come to this place after I saw it being featured on the Food Network channel (yes, yes.... \"diners drive ins and dives\" is one of my MANY guilty pleasures) And it didn't disappoint!  Honestly. You know it's a a good spot when it starts getting full on a monday morning.   First things first, if you can find parking on the street. Do it. You'll probably thank me later. The restaurant has a tiny parking lot in the back, but it's so tiny that you pretty much have to back your way out. Just save yourself the headache.   As for the food, amazing! The breakfast menu is not the most extensive, but it has all the right stuff. Omelets, pancakes, waffles, oatmeal, you name it.   Since I'm such a bore when it comes to my food, I opted for the cheese omelet with a side of home fries and wheat toast. The omelet was cooked to perfection. But I have to admit; the country potatoes and homemade strawberry jam were the best part of the experience. Who would have known?!  Definitively will come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I had the Cobb salad and a diet coke. The food was excellent and a great option at sky harbor airport. The bartender was very friendly and even noted to someone else how great the Reuben sandwich is."}
{"text":"Being the breakfast fan that I am, this was one of my first stops after a long trip to the East Coast.  I love Matt's because of the freshness of the ingredients they use.  Everything is hot and REAL, from the eggs to the the thick cut multigrain bread and scrumptious rosemary potatoes.  The daily specials are great, but classics like the \"Hog and Chick\" are just as tasty.  Be sure to come early or be prepared for long waits!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic... Atmosphere is too loud portions are reasonable prices are on the higher side... Bottom line the food is really good!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast and I'm a fan of visiting places from the show Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives show so I had to check out this spot. There was a long line to wait when my sisters and I showed up and wondered if it was worth standing in the summer heat for. Our thoughts were \"Come on, how good can you really make breakfast???\" My doubts were all erased the moment I bit into their delicious golden waffle! Apparently, they can make breakfast so good that it is worth waiting outside in the heat for an hour!!! And the joy continued...the thick cut peppered bacon was awesome as well as their sourdough toast. They have a homemade preserve to put on the toast that changes all the time since they buy local and seasonal produce. I have had their strawberry and plum preserves with the sourdough toast. Just mouth watering thinking about it. One of my sisters had the pork chop with pesto. Delish!!! And I am not usually a fan of pork chops. I have been there 4 times now and recommend it  to anyone!  One piece of advice: the best case scenario is to go as a party of 2 since so you might get seated quicker ;)"}
{"text":"My first and last time!   Nothing in my order was correct but it was so busy that it would have taken so long to get it corrected.  My server was unapologetic, so that I think, made it worse. Never going back. Was really expecting much more."}
{"text":"Went to matts big breakfast in the Phoenix airport while waiting for a connecting flight. We had the most delightful bartender serve us. They have a really awesome breakfast menu! I am just not that huge of a breakfast person and after being on vacation and eating badly I just really wanted a salad! They do serve salad and lunch items after 11. I didn't eat there as a grabbed a to go salad and just ate it at the bar with my beer! My dad God a burrito that looked super amazing! I with they had more beer on draft! So over kilt lifter and Stella.   I was also super bummed that I didn't get a chance to try their bloody Mary's! They looked so amazing!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Guy Fieri and this makes the second restaurant from DDD I have visited. I will be honest and tell you that he co-owns two restaurants in California, one of them being a place called Johnny Garlic's. The food was VERY VERY mediocre so I started to wonder if I should trust his taste in food, but then I said ok he goes to these places because people write to him and tell him they are amazing, not because he has any participation in the restaurant itself. So my mom and I went yesterday (Saturday) morning for breakfast.   We got there around 9 I think and we had to wait about an hour before we were able to be seated.   We looked at the menu and were like what the heck this is just basic breakfast food, did we just make a huge mistake? Boy were we wrong. The OJ was great. The coffee on the other hand, eh. I've had a lot better.   I ordered the omelet with provolone and mushrooms and onions and home fries and sourdough bread.   My mom ordered the eggs with hashbrowns and slice of ham.   The omelet was huge and gooey with cheese. The mushrooms and onions were cooked to perfection. The home fries were only ok, and that might be because they were a tad cold. The bread is obviously homemade and the jam that came out with it was incredible.   My moms ham was great. We were not expecting such a big slice and such a thick slice. The taste was amazing as well.   After breakfast we walked across the street and went to the farmers market.   I am visiting from California, and should I ever find myself in Phoenix ever again, I will definitely come back and maybe next time try the bacon egg and cheese sandwich.   The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the coffee and the limited menu options."}
{"text":"You had me at Bacon Bloody Mary. With it's rimmed bacon salt, stuffed olives, cheese, and its penultimate bacon, I was surprised how effective this airport spot was. Could go without the pickle, but that's my preference. I don't write too much for airport eateries, but this one in Phoenix has reason to return between flights."}
{"text":"Very good, if you're looking for fancy decor you won't find it here.  If you are looking for a delicious well cooked breakfast, this has to be one of the best places in Phoenix.  I had the Hog and Chick very fulfilling meal.  Only thing I didn't like was the parking situation, not good.  Parking meters in front bring change."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh squeezed OJ. Best pancakes I've ever had. Bacon was served crispy and cooked just right. My eggs were a bit more over easy, not over hard but still yummy. Excellent, attentive service. Parking was a breeze. We'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"i have tried three times on weekends to get in here, usually not in top form, i may have thrown up the parking lot once...sorry. but on a sunny thursday morning i manged to get in without much fuss.  usually the fussiness is outside, oh! there is shade now jane l. this makes sense because summer is ovah...duh. so anywho...screaming tots a go go. this is a tiny place...why would you bring your spawn here? i hear tell ihop has balloon animals? maybe you could have them fashion  an anchor shaped balloon creation to match your tattoo flash inspired t-shirt?   the choices here are slim but the portions are large as well as the amount of grease. hey i like grease...but like red grease dripping out of the back end of my burrito at 4 a.m. because in the gleaming light of the morning it makes me feel so dirty. i had the oats, surprisingly grease free and my partner in breakfast crime had the cheese omelette. i also ordered home fries on the side, some have complained about the rosemary...mine had rosemary, but it looked like it was accidental. pretty bland and boring. the entire experience was pretty bland and boring. i don't see what all of the fuss is about, sure it's good, but it's also breakfast...how hard can it be?"}
{"text":"Yes there is a lot of hype about Matt's and yes it's worth it. So is the wait. If you arrive any time after like 8:30 am on the weekend you will have to wait. It's no fancy brunch spot, just a good ol' traditional American breakfast that hits the spot. Eggs toast potatoes jam waffles pancakes and options of meat if that's your thing too - ( I've heard they have the best bacon around) it's all delicious and it really is BIG."}
{"text":"Again guys I dodge a line here! So be prepared to wait if you go after 8. Anyways it was 7am and there I was drinking a mimosa, the airport has weird rules and no judge zone am I right?  Their mimosa was pretty standard but it was actually fresh squeezed oranges which is a plus. But you know it's a mimosa so eh.   I had French toast and smoke sausage which the toast was amazing. The sausage however was so salty it wasn't even edible. So I left it.   The biggest flaw was that buzz me if you need a waitress button. It made the whole thing uncomfortable. At one point I wanted another mimosa but it didn't feel right to hit the button to buzz her over. That's just weird. I get their trying to under staff and save on waitresses but it's a weird encounter. The waitress was nice though with good recommendations but still.   If their is no line go if there is an obnoxious line skip it."}
{"text":"Very nice food and friendly service. We had the omelette and the french toast. Everything was fantastic! Best food I have ever had at an airport!"}
{"text":"Absolutely adore this place. Matts' serves the best breakfast in downtown Phoenix!! I usually order the special which is always amazing!!  The toast  is delicious with their organic preserves. The homefries are also yummy. I love the local vibe. The owner is always friendly,  and greeting you with a big smile! Stop by and you won't regret it! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"We've been back to Matt's Big Breakfast quite a few times now and after having had breakfast food at many other places in the valley, I have to update my review to 5-Stars!  I think that if you're a fan of breakfast foods then you'll be a fan of Matt's. My favorite item to get there is the cheese omelette (except I ask for it to be scrambled) with mushrooms, a side of the house potatoes, and sourdough toast. They serve all omelette dishes with 3 eggs so it's definitely a generous portion. Same for the potatoes, you'll get quite a bit of those as well, and they offer you an option of regular hash browns or the house potatoes. The house potatoes have lots of seasoning & taste different with rosemary ... I recommend trying them out! Even the toast tastes great as it's thick cut sourdough, and they serve it with yummy homemade preserves.  The only annoying parts are the parking situation and sometimes the wait time. Parking can sometimes be challenging to find and the wait time can be long if you are part of a large group. Either way, the food makes it all worth it!"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Matt's Big Breakfast when I was a resident of Flagstaff, AZ, where waiting for a good breakfast is an everyday part of life.  I know that some people in Phoenix will not be able to wait, since they have their Denny's and Waffle Houses in their neighborhood.  With that said, Matt's Big Breakfast is worth the wait.  Waiting is good for you.  And the wait is usually not that long.  And, while you are waiting, there is stuff to look and see and do!  The Downtown Public Market is adjacent to Matt's, the people at the Coronado Hotel are pretty cool after you give them a cigarette or \"shfifty shents\".    The staff is always in a rush but as pleasant as cherubs.  The coffee smells delightful, and the honey lemonade is the bees knees  The food is the best part! I love the ingredients that Matt picks, which are local and organic when the product is convenient, affordable, or rockstar status.  All the eggs are from local cage free chickens.  All of the jams and jellies (which rotate on a daily basis) are from local businesses and they will probably help relieve any allergies you have (if you live in Phoenix).  When I was a young Big Breakfast eater, I enjoyed the Five Spot and worked my way up to the to the succulent egg and pork Chop and Chick before graduating to simply ordering the special, and trusting that Matt and his minions will take care of me.  The specials are the reason why I keep coming back, and why I bring my friends.  I have brought out of town poets, musicians, and artists to Matt's.  They all love the diner feel, the orange and simple menu, the nice and friendly staff, and of course - the BIG breakfast."}

{"text":"Excellent. Great food, great service. Busy on a Friday morning, obviously others know about it."}
{"text":"Wow - just delicious food. Fairly limited menu and nothing fancy but the food was just fantastic. So much of it was made in house (including the bread and strawberry preserves). Their fresh squeezed honey lemonade was awesome. It gets pretty busy on the weekends but I can see why. I wish we had something like this in Tucson!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Sunday. Only had about a 30 minute wait, mainly because we got there later in the day. The food was good, but $4.50 for a glass of orange juice is a little over priced. I don't care if it's fresh squeezed, that's to much to charge for a glass of juice which is not refillable. I wanted French toast & found out they only had it on Wednesday. WHAT?! What kind of place that serves breakfast doesn't have French toast. They need to put it on the menu for EVERY day."}
{"text":"If you anticipate the wait at Matt's Big Breakfast, you'll have nothing to complain about. Put in your name, go get a coffee from Jobot, and relax. The staff is friendly and doesn't seem stressed about getting people in and out, and once you're seated and order your food, it comes out super quick. And it is fantastic. Hashbrowns have never been so glorious. Thank you Matt's, for a delicious place to start the day."}
{"text":"After driving from Lake Havasu to Phoenix, the bf and I were ravenous and wanted something big and breakfast-y.  Matt's Big Breakfast was the natural choice, and we didn't regret it, not one bit!  We arrived at 2pm, and the place closes at 2:30, according to the sign on the door.  Luckily, they let us eat.  I got the waffle and eggs ($6).  The waffle was possibly the best I'd ever had - big squares of Belgian waffle fluffiness.  The eggs, scrambled, were organic, and they made sure we knew it.  I appreciated this very much because I live in organic capital of the world.  Also on the side was a delicious, fresh thick-cut of bacon, perfectly peppered.  The bf had the salami scramble ($6.50), equally delicious, with authentic, not-out-of-the-bag salami.  These were thick chunks, and tasted wonderful in the softly scrambled eggs.  If I'm ever in this neck of the woods again, I'll be sure to stop by Matt's. Overall, a delicious breakfast experience for a steal!"}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite place to eat breakfast! They have such good simple food that is delicious!! We ordered the Chop & Chick, Belgium-style waffle, Hog & Chick, and the Breakfast sandwich. The pork chop was cooked perfectly and was super moist and flaverful. The size of things is pretty big, as there were 7 of us and we shared and finished everything! The bacon here is thick-cut and soooo good!! And the bread that comes as a side with the strawberry jam was fresh and toasted to prefection. It may just be bread and strawberry jam, but is was REALLY GOOD bread and jam! And they have daily specials, so make sure to check the chalk board outside to see!"}
{"text":"Very busy.  Warm atmosphere.  Service was quick and friendly.  We just beat the rush when we went.  We waited 5 minutes for a seat.  Pretty sure when we left the average was wait 30 minutes minimum.  Make sure to go early if you want to beat the rush.  The food was decent.  You get just enough food for the price.  I got the sweet and savory special.  It was French toast with a large breakfast sausage.  Everything was good, nothing blew me away.  I would eat here again, but just make sure you get there early to dodge the wait.  It's not worth the long wait at times."}
{"text":"YUMMMMY!  What more can I say, great service and exceptional food!  Everything is fresh and cooked to perfection.  We only waited a little while to be seated, but good things are worth the wait.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Just had brunch at Matt's.  Service is wonderful, you never feel rushed even though there are people anxiously waiting to get a table. Food is fresh and delicious. They really care about the food they serve.   The only things I wish were different are the bacon and sausage.  The bacon is thick cut....I love me some crispy bacon but even if you ask for it crispy it just never comes out that way. The sausage is good but I wish it had more seasoning like sage and all the other yummy stuff they put in sausage. I'm a sausage eater not a sausage maker;)  Those are the only things I wish were different. Other than that Matt's is awesome!"}
{"text":"The menu isn't overwhelming. The scrambled eggs I ordered with chorizo were really good. Hash browns had subtle taste and didn't need much of anything else to taste good. Would recommend if your looking for a good place to get breakfast."}
{"text":"The world famous Matt's big breakfast. Came down here specifically since I'd heard so many rave reviews. Maybe I ordered wrong - some of the most bland and dry pancakes I've ever had. And after spending $15 for breakfast (hash browns and milk) when I asked for a little more syrup for the pancakes, was informed they charge for xtra syrup - even though the initial syrup was a tiny metal container. Wow. Pretty sad. Won't be coming back here for sure. Otherwise the service had been quite good.  Extraordinarily noisy location as metal tables and chairs being slid around all over concrete floors - In my opinion the most underwhelming meal for the most overrated restaurant. They did end up removing the charges without my asking when I mentioned how bad the pancakes were. At least did the right thing, and like I said, maybe I ordered the wrong thing. But very disappointing meal. Manager apologized again and asked if I wanted anything else. Maybe you will fare better than I did"}
{"text":"Had a big group here, and it was a wonderful experience. Great staff, food was awesome (especially the potatoes), and Ernie couldn't have been nicer. I will be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"The owner Matt has a very stupid rule of no substitutions on his meals and offers really no options for people who don't eat pork even the chicken sausage has pork casing. Luckily the manager Jason is very helpful and friendly and accommodated us in every way. I would have given this place a 1 star if it wasn't for Jason."}
{"text":"A better name would be \"Matt's BAD Breakfast\". Service is horrifyingly bad.  The food isn't much better. After waiting 45 minutes to be seated and then sitting on uncomfortable barstools for 30 more minutes we found out our order mysteriously didn't get placed correctly and had to be submitted again. Then when it finally arrived the \"overhard\" eggs were runny and cold, the hash browns were partially burnt, yet raw in the middle. Our server offered no apologies - only excuses. The server never asked us if we wanted beverage refills (we did), nor were we provided with an order update-  even after it was obvious someone screwed up because customers seated 30 minutes after us had ordered and left before our food appeared.  Don't go unless you want overpriced Bloody Mary's, which are admittedly the only consistently good thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is super cute and chill, service is amazing! Very nice people. Went with my family and everyone loved the food, all got different dishes"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, clean restaurant, cozy overall. My family and I were in town on a visit and this \"hit the spot\" The food was delicious. If I were to visit the area again, I would go back. We are a family of 8 and everyone ate their food :)"}
{"text":"i was always told about this place. The waffles was all everyone talked about. But i went with a breakfast sandwhich and i do not regret it one bit  it was so delicious!!! The bacon was thick and perfectly cooked. I def. Suggest it. My friend had the waffles and I had some, those were so delicious  as well. Definitely will be going back again and again"}
{"text":"Oh my Goodness, so amazing!  Breakfast foods are some of my top favorite items to eat. The griddlecakes with sweet cream butter and real (Yes i said \"REAL\") maple syrup. Seriously these griddlecakes melt in your mouth. The thick-cut bacon was crispy and delicious and i dream about the breakfast potatoes with rosemary.   If you are in the area, or even if you are not.....you definitely should stop at Matt's Big Breakfast!  P.S. I hear the breakfast rush wait time can get a little crazy, I didn't wait in any line however I went around 1pm."}
{"text":"Midwestern hipster breakfast of champions - that's how I would describe it in 5 words.    Good down-home breakfast, but not for weight watchers.   Bright orange formica counters and rooster orange juice glasses.  Love that the place is smaller than a shoebox.  It means you have wait ahead of you, but it keeps the breakfast experience a friendly intimate one.   The hog and chick is what I usually order. But most recently I've been ordering the sopressata salami scramble with provolone and the five spot breakfast sandwich.  The burger buns are a lackluster choice, but the grilled onions and thick peppercorn bacon slices more than make up for it.  The hash browns can be a bit greasy, but hey, that's what happens when you cook with butter.    Can be a wait on weekend, but worth it in central Phoenix, especially when the Good Egg and other places get old."}
{"text":"Just passing through here on the way to San Diego. This place is amazing!! Had an omelette with mushrooms, roasted peppers (actually roasted well), Ham, and cheese. Came with hash browns, and toast, all equally delicious. Staff was very friendly and on top of their game."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best breakfast in town. The biscuits have spoiled me for all others. I wish they were always available"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting the newer downtown location since it opened. It was bustling and very busy. There was plenty of action, and things were loud. However, I knew that going into the situation. The food was awesome, I had their huevos rancheros special and ate every single bite. Service was swift, and coffee was plentiful. Yum!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes I've ever had. They're so big and fluffy and the butter is sweet. They just melt in your mouth. The syrup is so good too. Not too sweet but light and such a good flavor!! Between hashbrowns and home fries, I'd have to go with the Home fries. They come with some sweet onions mixed in and it's delicious. Hashbrowns are just a lil mushy under the crispy top layer. I'm not a huge fan of toast (it takes up precious pancake space) but the strawberry preserves it comes with makes it a necessity when eating here. Love the interior and the service!"}
{"text":"Not just for breakfast but they do breakfast right. The big breakfast is enough for any hungry traveler! Like any airport place it depends on time of day for service and timing. They do a great job of getting people in and out but at peak times its a wait but if you have the time it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place and had heard great things about it. We had a party of 4 and all of us felt it did not live up to the hype. In addition we all ordered different things. The food was good, the potatoes had a little to much rosemary and the OJ was ok. Considering the Yelp reputation and other reviews.....It was not a place any of us would crave to go to again. This was the first time a place that was rated so highly on yelp did not deliver for our group.  I am a Yelp fan....So With reviews this great, I would still consider trying it even after reading this review. Maybe we had an off day. I don't see myself going back, but encourage you to at least give it a shot."}
{"text":"Why do I punish myself. I had an hour before my flight so I gave them another shot.  Seriously, what takes so long to cook 2 eggs?  After 25 minutes and 2 server apologies later my order arrived with bacon instead of sausage. I grabbed the plate and said \"i don't have time for you to fix it\". They brought me sausage. Right away. Hey they can cook some things fast.  Just a mistake to stop here at the airport before your flight. Give yourself more than an hour."}
{"text":"Worse Cobb salad ever for me! Nothing but blue cheese and romaine lettuce. Also ordered gin and tonic but was served premium without being asked in a tall glass. So not worth the $26.00."}
{"text":"When in Phoenix, this is THE place to go!  The hot cakes? AMAZING! Soft and fluffy and heavenly and sooo good!!! everything was good, even the maple syrup. I also ordered the lemonade...just as good! it was made with real honey not sugar. Forget any of those breakfast chains, dont even think about it just get yourself to Matt's!  Do expect a wait, likely and hour in the morning, though if you come in later (got there closer to noon on a week day) the wait is much less and the ambiance less hectic also. The decor is cute and everyone was very friendly. It's a must for sure!"}
{"text":"Visit Date:  10/4/14  This. Is slowly getting worse. .. today strike 2.  Last week was not good, today the same. Eggs over cooked, potatos burnt. Quality is dropping.  I'll give this 1 more chance."}
{"text":"The ambiance is what makes this place. Fast service and up-beat atmosphere. Big portions will fill your stomach. The food was so-so. The sausage in the biscuit and gravy has MSG which makes your whole mouth and lips feel like there is a party going on. Not great for people who it affects negatively. They should really disclose this, especially since they are so proud to advertise that they use real butter and extra virgin olive oil.  My spouse had the ham and cheese omelette, and he said there was a lot of chewy fatty ham. He said it was a little bland for his liking.  Also had the blueberry lemonade at the waitresses? recommendation, it pretty good, very sweet, I couldn't finish it.  The rosemary potatoes were delicious, but probably not good enough for us to come back during our stay.   Good: -Ambiance -Price -Speed -Rosemary Potatoes  Could Use Improvement -Stop using sausage with MSG -Use less sugar in the Lemonade -Get more creative with spicing up other dishes"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town that I have had the pleasure to sample in Phoenix You will likely have to wait a while to get in, and seating is limited.  If you take a big party, you should be ready to wait a bit longer.  The food is always done great, and they have a daily special.  The ingredients are part of the success, and they use local fresh organic ingredients in the food.  The waffle is the best on that I have ever had in my life.  The eggs and ham or bacon are mucho terrific.  My cousin is a fan of he chop and eggs, and that its two healthy pork chops with eggs and sides.  I have eaten most of the stuff on the menu, and there is only one clunker in my book.  that is the home made potato chips with lunch items.  They are a little heavy for my taste, and its would be nice to see fries with stuff like a huge butter burger.  Sample the organic lemonade, and you won't be disappointed.  The restaurant is close to the light rail, so you could go there on that, and parking is limited.  Visit Matt's BB and you will be back without a doubt.  This is the kind of place that is more old school, and if you want a lot of space and don't want to be close to your fellow diners, you might not like the dining experience.  I see more of these kinds of places popping up now in Phoenix, and it is a great trend in having a more varied palette in the dining experience beyond the huge chains that seem to dominate such new cities like Phoenix."}
{"text":"Loved the fresh jam on the thick wheat bread, I was a lil disappointed with the meat selection all that was offered was pork. I would love to see turkey added to the menu."}
{"text":"I don't know what people expect from a \"diner\".  I took my parents there this week and both of them loved it.  This is not some \"health food\" place for the Birkenstock crowd.  This is traditional diner fare.  Greasy yes, and good.  My Father had the omelet with the hash browns and he loved it.  He even commented on how good the hashies were due to the fact they were slathered in butter/fat.  My mother had the pancakes and she loved them too.  They have corn meal in them which might not appeal to a \"traditionalist\", but they were very good nonetheless.  I had the Belgian waffle and it was very good too.    The coffee was typical diner fare as well.  I would not call it drek as I am a coffee snob and roast green beans at home.  The coffee was what I expected from a diner.  We went at 8AM on a Tuesday and walked right in.  The staff was friendly and prompt.    I would go again with no problem."}
{"text":"The line and wait explain it enough. Matt's is a great place to wait, especially if you are willing to wait in line. The best times I like to go are during the weekdays when the service and food come out as quick as you order it appears at times. The staff and customer service is as good as it gets, especially given the busy rushes. The plate sizes/portions, and the selections are a main reason why we all keep going back no matter the wait. Dont wait too long, head out now and beat the rush...."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Matt's! We walked in on a Sunday morning and we're greeted and sat down right away. Their Sunday special is steak and eggs so that's what my boyfriend ordered. I, a self proclaimed breakfast sandwich aficionado, had the Five Spot with a side of potatoes. The sandwich was very good, the bacon and onions made it. It was on a roll which is different but the roll held the sandwich well. The steak and eggs were cooked perfectly and the boyfriend was happy. Overall very solid breakfast place with good food and a nice atmosphere. I will definitely keep it in mind the next time I am in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! really, everything I had was great. I got eggs, bacon, hash browns, & one pancake on the side. I most definitely couldn't finish it all, but I loved every bite.  I would have loved coffee with my breakfast, but they provide no non-dairy milk or creamer for those of us who are allergic to milk. This always feels a bit offensive to me when businesses don't care, if people are allergic or intolerant to milk. It's pretty common. It's very easy to remedy this slight Matt's. Get on it, & you'll be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Matt's is very very good and mostly organic! There is a long wait time during prime breakfast hours though usually around 30 min-1hr but definitely worth the wait especially if you have never been! The food is all very fresh and service was quick! The prices are a little more expensive than a typical breakfast place but you're getting fresh and organic food verses frozen. Their coffee was very good and would recommend trying it! Overall we had a great experience and would love to go back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Waffles and pancakes are light and flavorful. Servers were attentive- coffee cup was never empty."}
{"text":"Ok, first of all - if you're not up for a wait, don't go here.  Simple as that.  The place is small and it's popular - put those two facts together and there's a wait.  In the summer - yea, it's tought.  Now - that being said, I usually go to a place just down the street (don't know the name, but it's a 30 second walk to the south from Matt's) and have a bloody mary inside (or you can get coffee, juice, whatever) and do my wait there while reading the paper.  So, this works for me - no big deal.  Once seated the food is simply great.  If there's a better restaurant serving fresh, sometimes creative breakfast fare in Phoenix I'd love to know about it.  But, as a Phoenix native, I haven't found an equal yet.  I usually get the \"five spot\".  Simple, delicious and reasonably priced.  I've had the specials from time to time and they've always been good to excellent.  The service is attentive and friendly.  And, as someone mentioned, the juice serving might be a bit on the small side - but it's always been enough for me and I'd prefer the excellent quality over 8 ounces of something average any day of the week.  So, take your favorite paper, prepare for a bit of a wait, enjoy the great weather (much of the year) and enjoy."}
{"text":"What's that you say? This is the best breakfast in town? Why I think you're right! Simply put, Matt's does the simple American breakfast and they do it rather well. I go for waffle, eggs, bacon, home fries. BAM. A good morning indeed. Small, cute, very 50s feeling. Sure, there's a line out the door, but it's well worth the wait. Trust me."}
{"text":"A really nice place for breakfast, especially on weekdays. The wait in weekends makes it a bit hard to justify at times, and the crowd feels different - folks in their groups who aren't as willing to socialize with others. The weekday crowd feels like more of a community - more solo diners willing to chat.   Food is solid all around - I've had almost everything on the menu and thus stick to the specials most days. You can't go wrong if you're looking for a hearty, well-prepared breakfast."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast this weekend.  Downtown Phx... fun vibe. We had 8 in our party but didn't wait long... got the little private room in front window.  Had the bfast sandwich... $5.95! Very good.. bread was awesome..DEF ..get the potatoes vs the hashbrowns. YUM. Homemade jelly made me order toast... glad i food.  Cool little place very reasonable."}
{"text":"Food was delish. I had the Hog & Chick, the preserves that came with the toast was tasty. Coffee was good. Niece was impressed they got her eggs done right. A bit of a wait but I had expected that, considering the amount of people we had before us the wait wasn't long."}
{"text":"My gal and I were downtown on a bit of a staycation, since we're locals, and I'd been to Matt's before... at the airport. This place lived up to expectations...!  There was significant road construction so you couldn't park very close to the place and it was a Thursday morning... and still, when we arrived, the place was packed with a bit of a wait - 5 minutes.  The food was good, I had the breakfast sandwich and we ordered the special eggs benedict as well as a waffle to share... all of it was really good!  The service was fast and attentive... and even though the place was busy the food came up quickly.  This place has had quite a local reputation... and I have to say if you're in the area and would like to get some breakfast - definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"It's just not the same as the original downtown location. The food was good, but the service wasn't as friendly. Granted we came in 40mins before close on a Sunday, so that's partially our fault. But definitely felt unwelcomed for coming in so late. Plus they were out of the steak and eggs Sunday special. :( Lesson learned, come earlier and hopefully you'll get the five star service to go with the five star food."}
{"text":"I had a bit of a wait for a table, but I expected that as it was Sunday morning. I was dining alone, and was seated in about 20 minutes. My waitress was engaging, and promptly brought water to my table. I was ready to order, so she took my drink (coffee) and meal orders at the same time. She returned quickly with the coffee, and I was surprised how quickly my meal (steak and eggs) came, given how busy it was. Steak was cooked as ordered, everything was hot and fresh!  I visit Phoenix on a regular basis and have eaten here several times. Staff have always been friendly and accommodating. Nice job."}
{"text":"Ever since attending college in downtown Phoenix I've attended this place on a semi-regular basis. I always take friends from out of state here and introduce them as the establishment with the the thickest slices of bacon you can find in the city. Out of 30+ visits I've never had a bad experience. I recommend getting their daily specials. Their produce is some of the freshest I've had at a local breakfast joint. I think they take advantage of the local farmers market that is hosted by their location althougg I'm not 100 percent on that, but whatever it is, it's awesome."}
{"text":"We decided that we would take in another great breakfast this Saturday at Matt's.  The food again was awesome that is not my beef.  We arrived at 0600 and our course there was no one else there since they still didnt open until 0630.  The employees were busy getting ready for the day.  Meanwhile some other customers started showing up and it seemed that a few of them knew each other so they must be regulars there.    The door opened and 0630 and a young blond lady invited us in with the others that were waiting.  This is were it happened!   I walked in the door and chose a table to the right and was informed that \"that table is set for three\".   WTF??    We were the first people in the door and anyone who has ever eaten knows that it is open seating and if seats are not available then you put your name on a notebook sheet of paper by the door and wait.  So, we sat down and watched three \"men\"  cruise over to the table \"set for three\"....   I guess that they get prefered seating over other customers.   I know it sounds petty but the tone of little blondy completely pissed me off.......  I dont think it was right and I think her tone was rude and you could tell she really didnt care what we thought about it..  I will think again before returning to eat here.   There are a lot of choices alot closer to home for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food, we got two pretty basic breakfasts (eggs toast bacon ect) and the huevos rancheros special. They were all really good, especially since they came with a house made jam, cage free eggs, and some locally roasted coffee (cave creek roasters, a great place). The house potatoes had a lot of great flavor, but I personally think they had a little too much Rosemary. That's a personal preference though. The service was good too, the people were friendly and the drink refills were en point. The reason why I give the place 4/5 is because I think he atmosphere was lacking. The place isn't very comfortable. Aluminum chairs are super loud, lighting is very industrial, we could see into the kitchen which wasn't the most pleasant view, and could hear every single thing the servers were talking about from across the room. It wasn't busy either, only one other table, so the sound was ridiculous."}
{"text":"***Matt's Big Breakfast is a good, fresh and made-from-scratch breakfast featuring both good sweet items (like French toast and waffles) to high quality breakfast meats (thick-cut bacon and maple sausage links)***  Matt's Big Breakfast was featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins & Drives.  It was in a smaller location back then and had an incredibly long wait.  It is in a much bigger space now though I believe it still has a very long wait; we were able to avoid the long wait though by coming early (a little after 8:00am on a Saturday).  I am not sure what their old space looked like, but the new space is nice.  It has an industrial look and there are great touches throughout the dining room from exposed pipes and a variety of seating to the big blackboard that announces the daily specials.  I had their French toast (which was a special).  It came with maple sausage links.  The French toast was very good.  It was thick toast and the outside was very good.  It had a nice, slightly crispy edge that had great sweetness.  There were great notes of cinnamon and the eggy crust was very addictive.  The inside was fairly moist too without being soggy.  However, because the bread was so thick, the very center of the French toast probably was not as moist as I would have liked.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix-2?select=6WCwYFxcTuQs-1nZktVsCg#QVj5TsuHRcV3qV5qcpzb5A  The French toast came with very good real maple syrup.  Extra maple syrup is available at an extra charge, but the portion they provide complimentary with the French toast and waffles is more than enough in my opinion.  The maple sausages were excellent.  The outside sear was very good and the inside was very juicy.  It had a great mix of salty and then sweet from the maple syrup.  Bob Evans used to do (and maybe still does) maple sausages and Matt's Big Breakfast's sausages were very similar to them though I would say Matt's sausages were thicker.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix-2?select=6WCwYFxcTuQs-1nZktVsCg#_MwLXLWjCU_o_fZ2Q3JiZg  I also tried their waffle and it was very good--nice, thick Belgian waffle that was light and fluffy with the right amount of sweetness.  Their hash browns were good as well--the right mix of soft shredded potatoes as well as a great crispy top.  These hash browns were seasoned just okay; ketchup and hot sauce was necessary.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix-2?select=6WCwYFxcTuQs-1nZktVsCg#B7lMBvpvsIg5opeOwymeVw  I also had their bacon and it was very high quality.  The bacon was incredibly thick.  It was not crispy.  Instead, it was a thick, meaty and chewy bacon (the fat was all rendered down).  The bacon was also heavily peppered.  While the bacon was definitely high quality, I would have preferred a thick bacon that had both a good crispy exterior as well as a meaty, chewy interior.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix-2?select=6WCwYFxcTuQs-1nZktVsCg#_3YUclGMUq1-1LN20B1CgQ  Service was good.  The food came out at a quick pace.  The restaurant gets busy though and it can be difficult at times tracking down a server.  Prices are not that bad.  Some of their items (like their specials and a la carte sides) are definitely on the pricey side, but a lot of their regular menu items feature good portion sizes and are under $8.  Matt's Big Breakfast is a worthwhile breakfast spot and definitely worth visiting if you are a breakfast fan and find yourself in Phoenix.  The food is very straightforward, but It is also immediately recognizable that a lot of the food is homemade/made-from-scratch.  This combined with the high quality ingredients really make this restaurant feel like a very special breakfast place.  I believe this restaurant has its own free parking lot in the back.  Expensive metered street parking is also available."}
{"text":"Worth the wait if there is one!"}
{"text":"So beyond sad that I have to write this review. I have been coming here off an on for a year... And today was my first bad expeirence but after reading some of the other reviews I don't think my expeirence is off par. I sadly won't be attending this establishment any more. It ties directly in with service and possibly the cooks... Normally its quite busy at lunch however I showed up at 11:15am so I think I beat the rush because I was able to sit down immediately. I asked the waitress how much just a side of one little pancake in addition to my meal would be and she said $3. I know the are a tad overpriced but for the healthier food on the menu I would pay that little bump in cost... not so much for little pancake. I ordered the special which was Eggs Benedict and asked that my eggs were cooked overhard. As I'm waiting for my food I realize that my water wasn't a fresh water (strange) it possibly was sitting out for awhile because it had 3 half melted ice cubes at the top (strange). So I asked for a fresh water which I felt like I was a bothersome. I received my food and took a big bite out of my eggs benedict only to realize that I was eatting a raw egg. I looked down and saw the dizzle of the yolk running down my food. Since my server didn't check on me after the fact, I motioned the first server I saw and told her I ordered it overhard and showed her the egg yolk. She looked a little dumbfounded and took my meal away. Returned shortly after with a new plate... or so I thought. Seeings how this was the special for the day I can only imagine that they had a big o pot of water in the back harvesting all these poached eggs. Well what they did with my eggs was throw the half eaten and the other poked egged into the pot because I received the same eggs I parted with earlier. I was so beyond hungry I just ate it. Luckily I have no dieases or anything that the next eggs benedict customer would be concerned with but still I'm a stranger... with my food all up on their food. I don't know doesn't sound appealing and makes me think what else do they do back there?! In addition, while eating my food, I ran out of water. No refill. Nobody came to check on me. No service. I didn't even get a bill. I had to walk up to the front to pay.   I did note that the owner who is usually there wasn't there this time. Not sure if that had anything to do with it this day. I just don't feel I was treated like a customer. Text my husband on the way out saying... well looks like I won't be back to matts big breakfast again... Overpriced food plus bad service... I rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wow! Considering this is an airport restaurant, I am very impressed with the quality of food served here. Their breakfast sandwich was flavorful and well worth the $9.00 I spent on the plate. If you are ever in terminal 4 of the Phoenix airport check this place out!"}
{"text":"Upon arrival, we came across a past customer who left a travel bag behind at lunch, when he stated his situation the manager refused to show any compassion \"it's been passed to the city of Phoenix, here's the number, that's all you got.\" lack of empathy as a manager, especially for a customer who already came though. This is how you treat your people, huh? Nice situation to walk into, it could have been handled better and not for everyones display. Everything else: Despite the trendy styling, the food was mediocre...Plain, flat, overpriced, nothing to write home about, chicken pesto and Cobb salad. Next time I'm in the Arizona airport,  I'll find a different restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm just piling on at this point, but Matt's is as good as it gets.  Reminds me of big homemade farmboy breakfast."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix visiting from California and found this place on Yelp. Food was amazing only bad part is i couldn't eat more and its so far away from home. I ordered a waffle and it was super delicious. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting the area."}
{"text":"So I walk up to this place and the surrounding area actually almost made me turn away. Then I walk in and it's really nice. I was greeted right away. Servers are great. I have to say the Manager seemed to not be very helpful as I was brought the wrong food TWICE and when he brought me what I actually ordered he said \"sorry she messed up when she put it in\" I'm pretty sure that wasn't the case but even if it was for a manager to place blame on his servers I felt was wrong especially since he brought me the wrong food the second time! Other than that the food was good can't really mess up eggs. I would prefer two slices of thin toast then one thick piece but that's just me."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast, the menu does not habe anthing fancy on it but what they cook it is done to perfection."}
{"text":"Never tried the Down town location, because didn't want to do the long wait times!  So after knowing this restaurant just by fame and recognition, went and tried it out.  Showed up and there he was; Big Matt with a big smile in his face; at the door being the hostess of his restaurant.  When do you see than any where else or any other owner with half of his reputation even attempting it.  Just by seeing that site and his humble positive energy I was really ready in trying the service and the food.  I never had an American Breakfast like this before.  Crispy waffles on the outside and gooey and soft in the inside.  Freshly squeezed orange juice and bottomless awesome coffee.  The pork chop was a little dry, but that was about it, everything else was awesome!  Matt does so many things right, stevia on the table, perfect selection of coffee cups made in the USA!, the fresh cut flowers on the table, but the very especial thing, was the staff!!  I think everyone of his staff including the two managers came to check up on us, and ask if they could get something for us!  Spectacular service, restaurants in the Valley should learn from Matt's philosophy!  Everything is honest, fresh, authentic, simple, taught off and  delicate.  Keep growing guys, keep getting better, maybe a Dinner menu with late hours could be a possibility!!  I can Dream right, and Dreams are meant to be lived!  Blessings"}
{"text":"Was initially excited to see a Matts location in Scottsdale, even tho I don't get up there often. I remembered the menu at the downtown location used to have some unique offerings so was disappointed to see that this location's menu is pretty much the same as many other breakfast places.  Decided to order the cheese omelet and hash browns...and even though I added mushrooms to the eggs, they were pretty tasteless, and they had no salsa... Really? In Arizona? The hash browns were so greasy I couldn't eat them. All in all a big disappointment. I think I'll pass..."}
{"text":"Sat down and had the Mamacita burger with seasoned fries. Possibly the best airport meal I've ever had. The server was great, the food was out quickly, and unlike McDonald's didn't look like it was rushed to be put together. The bacon was crispy, the bun was lightly toasted and perfect and the burger itself was cooked as I asked and tasted awesome. I would recommend this place to anyone with 20 minutes to enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had.  Hands down, the best breakfast joint Ive eaten at. The bloody Mary was excellent, home fries were so delicious, the waffles were perfect and so was the omelette. If we ever move to this area we will most definitely be regulars here."}
{"text":"A Big Breakfast with a small menu!  Note: this review is for the vegetarian options.  Small, cute restaurant in the middle of a neighorhood area that ALWAYS seems to have a line. Words of advice- WAIT. IN. THE. LINE!   Service- we sat at the bar, which isn't huge (I think there were between 12-15 stools), and the  server was very friendly, very helpful, and very nice. Our food was brought out promptly, water was refilled before we could get close to finishing, and we were checked up on every 5 minutes. 5 stars.  Atmosphere- Really cute place that's always full. It's not huge, but it's not tiny either. Everyone seems to be in a good mood, and its a wonderful BRUNCH location. It's fairly loud, so not a quiet, date location, but great to come with 1 person for good food, or with a small group for brunch at the tables. 4 stars  Food- And now for the best part. The food! They have a small menu which I don't mind because everything is well thought out and creative. The cheese omelet (with Wisconsin cheddar of course) was well-cooked, didn't have too much cheese to make it goopy, and went very well with the sauteed onions. The made-from-scratch Belgian waffle was DIVINE. Every bite was delicious and the REAL maple syrup it's served with is delicious. Don't drench the waffle so you can taste the amazing batter itself and the syrup to compliment it. 5 stars.  Drinks- ORDER THE FRESH HONEY LEMONADE! Wonderfully refreshing on a hot day, fresh, homemade taste, and sweetened with honey to add that kick at the end. 4 STARS.  Bottom line- come early, wait in line with good company, try 1 thing with syrup, 1 without, and order the lemonade. Go home happy."}
{"text":"No one liked the thick pepper crusted bacon. Prefer a thinner crisper bacon.  Slow service.  Sour dough toast too thick.  Does not carry coke.  Only RC"}
{"text":"Came back because I recalled having a nice breakfast about 1-year ago. My connecting flight is at another terminal and left there to try this breakfast again. Had Matt's Biggest Breakfast for $13.99. Sausage and bacon were special. Would have preferred the toast over the so-so pancake.  Eggs came out slightly more 'easy' than 'medium', but was acceptable for me since I like it either way.  Sat at bar. Katie provided good service while working the bar. Checked back. Kept busy. Even made sure my water was refilled. Thanks Katie. (normally don't write reviews)"}
{"text":"This place has got the recipe for success!  Their wait staff are always friendly and accommodating, their food is of the highest quality and prepared to perfection.  The downtown Matt's is usually quite busy with a wait, whereas the one on Camelback and 32nd Street is typically not difficult to get into right away.  I guess it depends on what time you go.  Early is most often the best time to go.  One of the best breakfast spots in Phoenix.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Don't get all the hype. Ridiculous wait for ordinary food. If you have an hour or more to kill on your weekend then go for it."}
{"text":"After a 45 minute wait we (party of 5) were seated at a good table...service was great, food was great, management not so great.  My daughter and a friend came in to join us toward the end of our breakfast...we asked if a chair could be added to our table...manager said no...very loudly and drawing attention to our table, that they could not join our party bc it wouldn't be fair to those who had been waiting.  We asked for a chair so she could sit with us. We understood the reason why she couldn't order, but his grandstanding in the restaurant was impolite & unprofessional.  After upsetting my daughter, my wife went to speak to him about how he handled the situation...rather than hear our concern regarding how he embarrassed a teenaged customer with his grandstanding, he proceeded to argue his point and justify his actions...he finally relented and offered an apology.  Fast forward 4 days, same teenaged daughter goes to breakfast w friends.  One of the party drops the check tray and it breaks....same manager gets upset and asks if the young lady had $32 to pay for the broken check tray...not joking, not playing around, but with the same arrogant and impatient attitude displayed just 4 days prior.  The place has great food and the service has been good each time we visited Matt's.  But this one manager's attitude, arrogance, and actions will keep us from visiting the Tempe location in the future."}
{"text":"I have been to two locations since I've moved to Phoenix and both are equally amazing! Their waffles, bacon, jam, toast, everything is to die for! And don't even get me started on their homemade syrup! I think I could drink it its that good! 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait if you're a breakfast person. The hash browns were amazing. I hope to go back again very soon."}
{"text":"Always good, Always a smile!   A\" must-go\" if you are anywhere in AZ ...!  ... get to Matt's and you can thank me later! ;)   A HINT: get there a little before 6am or bring an umbrella for the sun in case you have a wait.   Regardless ... wake early, travel with an umbrella or sunscreen OR sit for a bit ... you will be glad you \"close this deal!\"   Bfast or Lunch ... the answer is YES!  Bon Appetit!  - Britten"}
{"text":"Overrated and not worth the wait. I thought the bacon was decent but definitely not the best I've had. Was slightly too charred too. Hash browns were okay but a lot of dirty potato skin in it. Waffle was dry, even after dumping syrup on it. I would go back if there wasn't a wait, but definitely not worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and an electrical plug under my seat; exactly what an airport diner/eating place should be."}
{"text":"Summary:  crowded, high priced, mediocre food,  good service.  I read the mass volume of amazing reviews and showed up here with high hopes.  A roughly 20 minute wait and we were seated and served promptly at about 10am.    After approx 10 minutes or so, food was served.  We ordered the special (thick cut French toast) and a plate with eggs, bacon and hash browns.  Hash-browns were thick and oily,  practically dripping.  French-toast was thick cinnamon and raisin bread, maple maple syrup.  Nothing more.  It was really just thick toast.  Bacon... thick and dry, pretty crispy.  The homemade lemonade was really really sweet and seemed to me a mix of strawberry or blueberry syrups in our cups with lemonade.   Wasn't exciting or homemade in flavor.  All in all,  food was sub-par on a scale with a typical IHOP or Dennys, but much more expensive.  Food and drink for three before tip tallied at over $50.  Kind of a bummer.  Service was good all around.  I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Food is very subjective so what I'm not crazy about, someone else may like.  I had an omelet and had bacon added to the inside.  They were generous with the amount of bacon.  If you're one of those people who can't tolerate even a little golden color on your omelet you'd be unhappy.  It wasn't a lot or bad but there was some.  I don't care about that.  The orange juice was obviously fresh squeezed from good oranges.  My problem was the hash browns.  They were in a rectangular, flat shape, overcooked (crisp) and oily.  It was obvious the rectangles are made ahead of time and thrown on a grill as needed.  My toast was a disappointment too as it seemed like instead of spreading butter on each piece they had put an indentation in the middle of one slice, put a huge glob of butter in the indent and put the two pieces together.  One piece had very little butter on it and all in one spot.  The other piece had a well of mostly melted butter so that piece had too much on it.  The service was very good and people were friendly.  The seating leaves a LOT to be desired."}
{"text":"Affordable and delicious food! There's still a wait-time even after moving to a bigger location, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"It was greasy, they don't put onions in the hashbrowns. I would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Eh?  How have I not written a review for Matt's?  I went there a while back, but thankfully it won't be hard for me to recall the experience!  Place - Small. Food - Fantastic. Wait - Usually. Bathroom - An adventure.  We didn't have too long of a wait when we went, but that was entirely luck. I've seen crazy waits here, which is just par for the course when the food is good. Most of it is local and very, very good. Service was fast, and spot on.  The bathrooms are next door in an old motel. Apparently a separate room set aside just for Matt's. Just one more stand out feature for a very stand-out sort of place!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. It's a local hotspot in the city of phoenix. I was stoked when they opened one in the airport. All of the food is made from fresh I frequents often from local producers. I got a breakfast burrito. It was bomb, but I wish the potatoes in it were hash browns instead of slices.   Will be back again."}
{"text":"Gotta say, I was underwhelmed. I was surprised because of the great number of super-positive reviews.   I ordered the Hog & Chick. My first shock was the much-lauded bacon. While it's nicely cooked, it's almost completely covered in coarse-ground, strong pepper. To me, it was inedible. They very kindly replaced it with sausage, but that was almost burnt. Puzzling.  The next thing was the hash browns. I ordered them \"extra crispy.\" What came out was a pale, limp, undercooked, slight greasy brick of potatoes. They looked nothing like the pictures I've seen posted.  Since I'd already sent back the bacon, I sucked it up and ate it but it wasn't appealing or tasty.   I don't live in Phoenix but, if I did, I don't believe I'd be back."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Atlanta,GA. Found this place in a thrillist list.   The place was worth the 45 minute wait.  My fiancé order the scramble special with amAzing apple sausage. It was a huge portion and tasted amazingly.   I ordered the chick and the hog with over easy eggs and the house potatoes. The taste was amazing. The potatoes aren't the healthiest option but it tasted so good with the grilled onions. I had the sausage which was a little too salty.   They gave us bread with strawberry preserves. They were sweet and Greta taste.   If we lived here, this would be a regular spot."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast has wonderful food cooked from scratch. The bottomless cup of coffee is excellent and goes with the omelet so well!"}
{"text":"Went to go check on this place for the first time. I had heard such great things. Walked in to get seated the guy who was taking our order was rude. So we told him we were not ready yet so he went about his work another person came by took our order. Once we got our food. My potatoes where completely burnt and way to much oil. Had to send them back. Got a new order in less than a minute. They were not burnt. However still lost of oil. Other than that the food was okay."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Well to be clear, I never actually ate here...unless you count my stomach eating itself from utter and total starvation!   Coming all the way to Matts was a stretch for us, living on the west side and having a breakfast place we already love. But...we had heard great things and wanted to check it out. MISTAKE one.   We called and were told there wasn't much of a wait. We arrived and were told it should be pretty quick. I think that's the point where they realized we had kids. This place HATES kids. MISTAKE two.  We waited for 90 minutes! We watched parties come after us, get seated and leave while we were waiting outside. And these were parties of ALL sizes. They even LIED to us and said we were next and sat a party of the exact same size that arrived 20 minutes after us.   We left and went around the corner to the Phoenix Public Market. I doubt that the food here could be good enough to put up with their complete and total bullshit."}
{"text":"Monday late afternoon...50% full tables...fast service...tasty Reuben...nice waiter. Will come again."}
{"text":"1. Awesome location. 2. Fantastic Food. 3. Great environment.  Only reason to not give it 5 stars is because the wait time is so long but this place is a must go."}
{"text":"Being new to the Phx area and trying new breakfast spots was not all that exciting, came up on Matts Big Breakfast. And let me tell you, best breakfast ever! Service was absolutely wonderful the second time around (; and we will be going back soon! Thanks Matt for being awesome!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place atmosphere and the food so good ! The coffee and fresh squeezed OJ , the only bad thing that is always so busy ! But is worth the wait !!! Those potatoes and the omelette sandwich made my brunch expectations, really nice and clean place the customer services was excellent!"}
{"text":"Perhaps if I waited outside in the heat for an hour plus to the point that I became starved and dehydrated, I too would have thought Matt's was worthy of 5 stars. Or maybe the 5 star reviews come from people too ashamed to admit that they wasted most of their morning on a very average breakfast.  In my case, we came here before 7am on a Friday and got the last available seats by the window. Service was great; I didn't detect any attitudes from the waitstaff that has been mentioned in some reviews. They got our meal out quickly and made sure our coffee mugs never got empty.  With the exception of the toast and jam, the food never rose above \"good.\" Isn't that pretty sad that the best offering from a breakfast diner is the bread? I liked my waffle since it was a bit crisper than what I can do at home with my geriatric waffle iron, but there was nothing noteworthy about the flavor. My husband said his eggs were cooked perfectly with his chop and chick dish, but the pork chop was under-seasoned. He found the hashbrowns way too greasy to be enjoyable, and the bacon suffered from being overcooked.  Maybe we're spoiled since we have two great breakfast places within walking distance (Joe's Farm Grill and the Coffee Shop). Matt's just isn't worth the drive or wait."}
{"text":"I went for brunch with my boyfriend this morning. The omelette I had with added mushrooms was very good. My boyfriend had the skinny and he liked it. The service was mediocre. We were seated and had to wait about 10 minutes before someone came over and asked if we were offered drinks yet. They then got our server to take our drink and food order. The check was dropped off about 3 minutes after our food was served. I hadn't even tried a bite of everything on my plate yet. Before we had even finished the meal, forks were in hand, they asked if we were done eating. It definitely felt like we were being rushed out of the restaurant.  We got to the restaurant at 11:20a and there was no wait, there was still no wait for our table 30 minutes later when we were asked if we were finished about 5 minutes after receiving our food. Yes the food was great but would I go back, no."}
{"text":"We were seated and the server took our orders almost immediately. The service and attention is not lacking, however sometimes quick is not always great. The atmosphere is \"hip\" or fresh, but it was loud and echoed. The food came out fast but was just ok. I had the French toast special, which was a bit too thick and rather dry. The apple smoked sausage was ok, but not all that flavorful. The real maple syrup was a nice touch though. I ordered some scramble eggs on the side which were hard/ overcooked. If you like them well done, then the eggs are for you. My wife had their eggs/potatoes/bacon breakfast. The bacon was almost too peppered, and she has a pepper allergy. She said the eggs snd potatoes were ok, but that I make better at home. All this cost us just about $30 before tip which is much pricier that I am used to for breakfast food, and not outstanding enough in taste to justify it. Also to note is that they can't divide checks. My wife needed a separate itemized check as necessary for her company to reimburse her expense and they cannot and will not do that. Apparently it is mentioned somewhere on their menu about that but our 2 minutes to order meant we had to look at the food offerings instead. We have had better experiences at other places nearby and have also received other recommendations for better breakfast food."}
{"text":"Gotta try Matt's! They really are putting out a superb breakfast. Love the thick cut toast and Pork Shop (queen creek) thick sliced bacon with cracked pepper. Even the bottomless cup of coffee is a great coffee. Keep up the great eats Matt!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Matt's Big Breakfast with 6 of my peers after an informational session on a Saturday afternoon. It was very busy, there was at least a 30 minute waiting period, and we had to wait for all the members of our group to be present before our waiting period even began.  Even though we ended up waiting for a little over 30 minutes, it was well worth the wait because we got to sit at this big table located in a little room they have off to the side. It made the setting very intimate and homey since we were surrounded by cute decor and a refrigerator holding Matt's homemade preserves.   The first time I ever went to Matt's Big Breakfast I was really craving egg salad so I ordered the egg salad sandwich, which even though it was good, it wasn't anything I would return back for. With that in mind, this time I decided to order something Matt's Big Breakfast is known for, that being BREAKFAST! I ordered the special of the day, the egg scramble complete with local cheese, spinach, and sausage. Between the hashbrowns or home fries I ordered the home fries  (basically quartered potatoes, crisped to perfection and seasoned with rosemary, YUM). The scramble came with a side of toast with butter and a little cup of their famous preserves. I ordered sourdough toast and the preserves that it came with were strawberry. Their preserves are definitely worth a try! Not to be confused with jelly, their preserves have a nice consistency with bits of fruit noted.  I would not recommend dining here if you have big groups in which the check needs to be split. I say this because if we wanted the receipt split according to what everyone ate, we had to take it up to the counter where we were informed by the cashier that she was unable to split it by item, we had to give her dollar amounts. This got a little tricky since the receipt wasn't itemized but rather grouped into by item (i.e. 3 hog and chick's were ordered and the receipt only showed the total for all three). Additionally, we didn't have menus in front of us to determine the individual item prices and our group was fairly large which made standing at the cashier doing math quite the inconvenience for anyone in line behind us.  It mostly seemed like there were families and parties of one here at Matt's Big Breakfast so definitely go solo or with your family.  I would definitely recommend Matt's Big Breakfast if you're looking for homey breakfast food with subtle modern nuances."}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff and great food. Daniel, who takes togo orders, is incredibly friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Ok ok, this place is fine.  But it's so LOUD.  Don't expect to have an actual conversation with whoever you are dining with.  And it's a little hard to find something on the menu that doesn't have bacon.  If you're a veggie there is one option you can, but the veggie option (like for an omelet) are scarce.  However, what I did order tasted good, it's just not something I wanted to eat really, it was kinda my only option.  When I go out for breakfast I want an amazing breakfast burrito with a side of fruit, not some eggs I could have made at home."}
{"text":"Christmas Eve at 9:50pm and the waitress Corrina was the rudest person I've ever encountered. I'm stunned. I literally left the restaurant because of her. I would have left you a $10 tip for my $12 sandwich Corrina, it is Christmas Eve after all. I'm not a grinch... For the record, she was immediately mean. Even before I could say hello."}
{"text":"I finally made it here. The staff was genuinely friendly, I chatted with a few and a manger. The lemonade is delicious I had the blueberry. The waffle with the chicken apple sausage was delicious. My son enjoyed the pancakes and bacon   They do not have a kids menu but both of our meals where big enough to share. The location is in a beautiful facility. I would definitely go again. No wait not a lot of people. I'm sure it's different on the weekends. The prices are also reasonable."}
{"text":"Good service and good food and good prices. We came here on a holiday morning and waited about 15 mins before getting seated. Be warned that there is no dedicated parking area for this restaurant and you'll have to use the metered street parking. The atmosphere of the place was very busy but aesthetically pleasing enough. However, we came here to catch up with family, and it was just too noisy to hear most of the conversations. I strained my voice as if I was talking in a club. In the end, I would still recommend this place because the quality of the food is good for their price."}
{"text":"Had an extended layover in PHX airport and decided to try this place out. I had forgotten that Guy Fieri highlighted the downtown spot on DDD.  Local coffee served from Roastery of Cave Creek. The panda needed that caffeine.  Five Spot Platter ($8.95): Breakfast sandwich with bacon, American cheese, two eggs, and grilled onions. Potatoes on the side. The roll is large, with a small layer of filler. On the plus side, the roll was soft and fluffy. The roll's flavor reminded me of a croissant. The potatoes were seasoned generously with salt and pepper. Bacon was excellent. Good portion. Overall, I'd say The Five Spot hit the spot.  I just sat at the bar for this one. Good service.  I saw others at the bar ordering Reubens. Hefty sandwiches that are recommended by the staff if you want a nice-sized lunch.  I'll have to remember this place next time, should I opt for a very gluttonous meal."}
{"text":"For starters the food really is great here. But I would choose a different place if you have any interest in actually hearing what anyone is saying at the breakfast table. The place is so overcrowded and loud, it makes it difficult to enjoy the time with friends. Frankly this place is over rated."}
{"text":"I love this place for many reasons! One the atmosphere of the place is just really cool and modern. Second, the service is great; all very friendly staff. Third, the food is beyond delicious. I ordered their breakfast sandwich, I couldn't even finish it all. They serve you huge portions here, so come with your appetite. Don't even get me started on the bacon; so fresh, juicy, and delicious. Overall this place just is amazing for breakfast. They have my business. Try them out!"}
{"text":"Meh.   I was excited to try this place because my friend loved it last time she came but it wasn't worth it to me. For $60 on brunch I'd expect better service to be honest.  The place wasn't busy at all and our sever never checked on us. We're halfway through meal and champagne glasses are bone dry and our server brings us our bill stating no rush... to me when I'm still eating and the bill is brought that is rushing me out. We were there around 130 which they still had an hour to close so idk why we were being pushed out so fast. We asked for another drink and our server acted like he didn't wanna work anymore. We said thank you and he's like mhm, crumples the bill he originally brought to add extra drink and walks away. I'm sorry, but adding more drinks to bill raises the bill which means more tip.   The food was pretty good. I had the skinny eggs and it was a good portion for the price. I'm all about service though and this place fell short of that. The manager was checking on table but never came to us. The manager came to our table to take my card to pay, and I said oh it's already paid I need to just sign and he drops card and walks off.. doesn't say anything. Kind of odd  I live in north Phoenix and drove to Tempe cause my friend said it was worth it but I don't think so. The service was meh and the food was alright. Not worth the drive tho so this will be the place that I skip next time."}
{"text":"Delicious food overshadows poor inattentive service. My party of four waited nearly 40 minutes today(Friday morning) and when we were finally seated our waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink order. After that, service was slow and had poor follow up. Forget trying to get a coffee cup refilled(I got up and went near the kitchen window to get a refil).    The good news is that the omelette and egg scrambles are delicious and large.  Homemade breads are wonderful. Our meals were delivered by some other team member and we never saw our waitress again until it was time for a check.  No follow up!!! Management may think the team approach is fine but someone, ie the primary waitress, needs to maintain some degree of attention to the table once food has been served. When we were leaving we mentioned this to our waitress and she just shrugged her shoulders and thanked us for coming...wow! I must reiterate how good the food is...We will return again because of that fact."}
{"text":"I'm all about the QUALITY of food and the quaintness of the facility. The fact they use local grown, organic ingredients... SOLD ME then you add in the cute decor and limited tables I WAS HEAD OVER HEELS! They treat you VERY WELL, we had our 2 little girls with us and they came by to offer pens for them to color while we waited for the food (which wasn't very long) - the food was hot, fresh & Delicious the Coffee was AMAZING and they HUSSSSLLLEEE to get you in and out to accommodate the people waiting which as a consumer is important because we all get discouraged by long lines or tons of people wiating out front. I can't wait to go back-"}
{"text":"They told us it was going to be a 30 minute wait but it was only about 10 minutes and we were glad we waited.  Great little place. Yummy food and charming decor! I wish I tried the honey lemonade but next trip to Phoenix"}
{"text":"We visited Phoenix last week and ate breakfast here twice.  The food and the staff were terrific.  I wasn't hungry for many, many hours after having breakfast!  It's a bit on the noisy side and you do have to wait.  I think we waited between 20 - 30 minutes each time."}
{"text":"So, there are several kinds of hyped places to grab a good breakfast.  One is the hyped vegan/paleo fresh squeezed kale juice place that soothes guilty thoughts about enjoyed food by giving you overpriced mush. Next is the trendy place that overcharges you for average food and makes you wonder what all the hype is about    And THEN you hit a place like Matt's and you understand that even the unwashed ignorant masses get something right occasionally.  Matts is a breakfast place, low on ambience and high on service and amazing on food!  Thick cut bacon great eggs and fantastic biscuits and gravy make you glad that you did something right today.  The things that really get you are the great big buttery pieces of toast and killer jam and the epic hash browns.  If anyone has ever written poetry about hash browns, you know where they went to breakfast that morning.  Great place great food, just get there early and on a weekday unless you have literally nothing else to do that day besides stand in line!"}
{"text":"BACON! The bacon is the shining star! We went later around 12-12:30 on a Sunday, so we only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. There were about 2 other couples waiting after us and then there was no wait to be seated. So going later could be a good tactic; however, the specials had run out, so as long as you don't care about that, you got it made.  I ordered the hog and chick with home fries, The bacon is the bomb, thick and delicious, the home fries are also so flavorful, and my scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly.  You also get a large slice of buttered toast and jam.  The man had the chop and chick and a side of bacon with home fries. I tried the chop and it was good, but a little over cooked (dry) in my opinion. He also had the strawberry honey lemonade which was delicious! I can't order drinks with no refills because I drink a lot, so I had the iced tea.   Overall, very good! I wouldn't wait 2 hours to be seated though, I'd come back for the bacon!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered the waffle that comes with amazing flavorful thick  bacon with just the right amount of pepper. We also ordered the special, which was a chorizo scramble with cheddar cheese and jalapeños, it was to die for. We switched out the tortilla for toast so we could try the preserves based on other Yelp reviews, the flavor was blueberry and it was AMAZING! I couldn't believe how great the hash browns were, they really take pride in them with a cheese filling, no ketchup needed. The food came out really fast and service was friendly."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years. I really liked the food the very first time, but this second experience was pretty mediocre. I thought there was a big menu selection but there's only a few choices in the typical American breakfast categories. Prices usually range around 10-15 dollars. For that price I really hoped for better tasting coffee but it's your average typical coffee found in every Denny's. I ordered the basic breakfast (what my son calls a typical breakfast) 2 eggs, bacon, country potatoes and sour bread toast. My favorite thing on my plate was the sour bread toast! Fantastic! The bacon and potatoes do have their own unique favor. With strong hints of rosemary and black pepper.   Would I come back? Sure, if i was in the neighborhood and it was around a non peak hour. This place does seem to get a bit congested. Be willing to wait 15+ minutes for a table."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had at a airport hands down,  Good size portions and very good. Had ham and cheese omelet with fried potatoes and they actually had seasoning fried with them and onions Was good stuff, Price was very fair for a airport"}
{"text":"Went here this morning. As usual, the wait was crowded out to the corner of 1st Street. People are willing to wait for good food, I suppose.   Once you get inside Matt's Big Breakfast (it was about an hour wait for us on a Saturday morning), you see why it took so long. There's about 15 seats in the whole place and it's tiny...like a Manhattan hotel room. People are bumping into each other, sliding around and the commotion is high. It's loud, it's gritty and it's the perfect diner setting.  For all the press it's gotten, the food better be damn good. And it is. The eggs are cage raised and organic, the pork is from high-quality Iowa farms and most of the produce is local. The fresh-squeezed OJ is legit. And the coffee is from a premium roaster in Cave Creek, AZ. The hash browns are very much like you would find at a joint in the Midwest: buttery on the inside and crispy brown on the outside.   Do yourself a favor and brave the wait and the commotion... it's worth it."}
{"text":"Not really worth the wait. food was ok, hash browns were under cooked and my pork chop was dry, boo hiss. Staff was very nice, but they seem to have a hard time keeping up with all the people. Biggest disappointment of the morning was when a party of 8 showed up 15 mins after our party of 3 and was seated before us???? not really sure how that worked out? Oh yeah no bathroom, make sure not to order any coffee."}
{"text":"Found a great breakfast place about 10 minutes outside of the airport. I noticed they list a location inside Terminal 4 but, for some reason I missed seeing it.  As I arrived at their downtown location, I noticed a crowd waiting outside the front of the restaurant. This is always a good sign that you're in the right place. I sat at the counter and ordered their classic Hog and Chick (bacon and eggs) with home style potatoes. Their potatoes are well seasoned and their bacon is nice and thick with the right amount of black pepper. It came with 2 thick pieces of sourdough toast with a special home made jam that you should not pass up. It actually looked like a small side of salsa. But, it came served with my toast. So I tried it and it was amazing. I don't know what's in it but, trust me when I say it's worth a try. This is significant since I'm normally not a jam person.  Great friendly staff. I highly recommend it if you're ever in the downtown Phoenix area and have time for breakfast, stop by Matt's Big Breakfast."}
{"text":"My boyfriend came here on a Saturday morning (probably one of their busy days) and waited maybe 10 minutes. The short wait was SOOO worth it. We ordered two blackberry honey lemonades and my bf said it was the best lemonade he's ever had in his life!  A customer next to us ordered the special of the day and it looked so good we had to get the same! It was some sort of sausage hash with rosemary potatoes (writing this review a few weeks later so I can't remember exactly.) First off, it was a HUGE serving. the rosemary potatoes were perfect and the strawberry jam that came with the toast tasted like biting into a fresh strawberry.   This is definitely the best breakfast in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My friend read some great reviews so myself and 3 friends just went today.  Had the special it was great cool atmosphere great service,  very attentive. .. A must go if you want good scratch cooking breakfast. .."}
{"text":"I went to Matt's BB for the first time last weekend.  Took me a moment to get oriented - it's not immediately obvious if you present yourself inside to get on a list or not.  The answer: not.  You sign yourself in.  Once we had that figured out, we waited - but not for as long as I thought.  They certainly have an efficient little operation.  The staff brought out menus for any large parties so the kitchen could start in on their order before they were seated.  Once inside, we were greeted warmly and had our orders taken promptly.  My wife tried the special - an odd scramble of eggs, spinach and chicken sauage.  She got hers with hashbrowns and some really nice, thick, fibrous toast.  I had a few bites of her toast and was frankly tempted to order some for myself.  I thought the hashbrowns were OK, but I am not crazy about hashbrowns.  I ended up with a bowl of their steel-cut oatmeal, which came with raisins and brown sugar (and milk), then got a side of the homefries.  Sure glad I ordered that side - they were the highlight of the meal.  Perfectly cooked, with nice big chunks of potato, slightly blackened, with fresh rosemary.  Now, I am not always enthusiastic about rosemary.  Can be too strong.  But they'd added the perfect amount.    I commented to my wife that I could see coming there and having a couple orders of their homefries as my meal - they were that satisfying.    The oatmeal was also very tasty.  I wasn't going to bother with it until I saw it was steel-cut.  It was my first time having steel-cut oatmeal at a restaurant, and I enjoyed the contrast to the typical restaurant oatmeal.   Someone at the next table ordered the pancakes, and they looked fantastic.   Service was very attentive and efficient.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for hash browns. And boy does this place do them right.  They are almost like a potato pancake, but even better.  Perfectly crispy, salty, greasy, but not overly greasy.  Everything else was just the cherry on top of the sundae.  Came here on Friday afternoon (around 1ish) and it was still packed.  We still had to wait about 25 minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad.  The place definitely needs to bogart a few more buildings and expand.  But we sat at the counter and bar stools which made me love my hashbrowns even more.  The griddlecakes were alright.  Nothing to rave about.  The rueben was good, a little too much sauerkraut for my taste, but others loved it.  The three egg scramble looked fantastic, and by the evidence of the licked-clean plates of my friends, it was a winner.  Definitely worth a 30 minute wait in my book.  A 2 hour wait?  Eh, probably not.  Even if those hash browns are calling my name right now."}
{"text":"Six of us ate here. The food is great & served hot. That alone impressed me. The waitresses are not assigned to stations so the servers don't get distracted & forget about you. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went to Matt's on Monday morning. Quick seating. Looks to be a roomy location. My wife got the Huevos Ranchero which is the Monday special. My biggest complaint would be that this isn't a regular menu item. What the heck?  It was outstanding. I got the Pork & Chick with the sour bread toast. They have a magnificent jelly or marmalade. I must've been asked if I wanted a refill on coffee 5 times. Great service, excellent food!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Love their food and service were always attentive if we needed anything. One of my favorite places to eat breakfast in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Got the breakfast burrito and it was about 90% potatoes and 10% eggs and bacon. Not very good at all."}
{"text":"Great place. Will 100% go back again the next time in Phoenix. The whole wheat toast that came with the omelette was insanely good, and it came with homemade strawberry preserves. It was covered in butter and was just awesome. The omelette was great, and the homefries were delicious. The coffee was also great; fresh roasted and solid. It's not a cheap place by any means (reasonable), but you can get a garbage bfast at any chain for 5$, or pay a little more and get a quality meal that leaves an impression. Boom shockalocka!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in Phoenix! Hash browns were incredibly buttery and creamy, the special 3 meat scramble w/pepperjack cheese was excellent, and the kids liked the pancakes. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#mOrO9Ye3lyhOiv-mD-K_JQ  They recently moved to a new location at 1st St/Garfield since being featured on DDD. Look for this mural as you go down 1st St.: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#6zWWyXZVsPp83YplKgGr5g  Cozy little place has 12 tables and a breakfast bar section to hold maybe 50(?) people in there. Apparently it's no secret because we attempted to go at 9:00a on a Saturday morning. WHOA. 1hr+ wait.   We tried again at 1:30pm the same day and there was no line. So if you can't get there at 6:30am when they open, I would recommend going after the lunch crowd dies down, before they close at 2:30p. Look at how empty it gets: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#l4u6G9p-5Jzlbw7oS2kCjA  At that time you can order off the breakfast OR lunch menu, if they haven't sold out of everything by then."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast has great food!!! Our family loves to go on the weekend, but it can be crowded."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast, much like Notorious B-I-G, isn't a player- but it crushes a lot.   MBB has the trifecta of amazing food, great friendly service, and a gorgeous setting, inside and out.   I've been a fan of MBB since the early days where only 25 people could eat there at a time. MBB was quickly known for thoughtful hearty breakfasts using only the finest ingredients from the best purveyors. Since that time MBB has grown and added locations and yet somehow has managed to maintain its integrity and heart- which is no small task.   This Tempe location is just stunning aesthetically. Nestled in the beautiful glass canyon that is the State Farm campus, MBBs sits like an inviting beacon- welcoming hungry office workers, students, and other people with superior taste buds.   This location is airy and bright, with beautiful touches everywhere the eye can see. It's immaculately clean and you can tell there is a lot of pride from the staff who keep it spotless.   The service is just awesome. I go weekly with my Sis and Niece- and the crew at MBB could not be more pleasant. My niece insists on showing all the staff her baby doll (Her name is \"Baby\" in case you were wondering) and they all take a minute to ask questions about the baby and talk to my niece, which is so sweet.  While they have so many awesome staff members, Michelle is our favorite. She's so warm and friendly and sincerely cares that all her guests are well cared for.  Having Michelle take care of you feels like you are a guest at her home- in the best possible way.   The food at MBB is epic in every aspect. I know some people make the argument \"It's just breakfast- I can make this stuff at home.\"  Two things. 1. Stop being a monster. 2. No you can't. You can make SOME kind of pancake, but you cannot replicate these griddle cakes. They are untouchable. Fluffy clouds of goodness that give you hope for humanity. My sis and I argue about waffles Vs. griddle cakes. Sadly she was dropped on her head a lot as a baby so she feels waffles are better, but we all know the truth.  See for yourself, either order a stack of griddle cakes or you can get one on the side to try for the table. I assure you that it will change your life.   After breakfast- take a stroll around the campus and see the beautiful fountains. You won't be disappointed by MBB or the views surrounding it."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  Got there at 7:15 on a Sunday, waited only five minutes and got right in. Today they had a great steak & eggs special, it was out of this world. I brought a friend who had never been there, and she loved her food as well. One thing I recommend is to order a pancake on the side (in case no one in your party orders a full order). The pancakes are unreal, they are SO good, and if you've never tried them, do yourselves a favor, and try them.  As usual, service was on point, and even though the place is packed and super busy, everything was taken care of. When I read negative reviews of the place, all I ever see is complaints because there is a wait, etc.  It is important to note, this is NOT an IHOP, or Goodegg. You WILL wait to get in, and it is worth every minute of the wait. If you're not able to do that, then perhaps you should go elsewhere. Also, if you have more than a party of four, please consider either breaking into smaller groups, or go somewhere else.   The food at Matt's Big Breakfast is thoughtfully planned, prepared, and executed. If you haven't been yet, enjoy it!"}
{"text":"This was a case of high expectations falling short. After seeing it on a Food Network show and reading about it in numerous sources, I had high hopes for Matt's Big Breakfast. After waiting for 45 minutes, we made it inside the tiny restaurant.    Everything was ok, but nothing spectacular. I do appreciate their no microwave, no freezer rule, but I feel it didn't live up to the hype I had read/heard about.   Maybe I'm just spoiled by good Bay Area coffee options, but the coffee here was BAD. The salami scramble was pretty average and the Belgian waffle for which a lot of people rave about, was fine, but again, didn't stand out as amazing. The thick cut bacon was awesome and a nice accompaniment to the waffle.   However, waiting for 45 minutes and feeling rushed to get out the door, just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Went over to this spot based on the Yelp reviews here, and there wasn't many options honestly in the downtown Phoenix area to choose from for a breakfast spot.  Wait time was pretty quick. Food was good, but not spectacular.   Honestly, I don't care to give a in depth review on this location since I will probably not come back unless I need to get breakfast somewhere and we are close by :)   Try it out if you want. Your not missing anything."}
{"text":"This place has been on our bucket list for a while now and totally lives up to the hype. This place is the epitome of what deserves 5 stars.  The food is spot on. Orange juice is pristine. Every single thing that touched our lips was incredible. We sat at the bar, and the waitress was friendly and efficient. People stand in hellish heat outside to wait for a table here, and let me tell you, it is worth it.   Go. Put down your computer and run to eat here."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. Cute little restaurant in a nice area of Phoenix. Had an omelette Ava country potatoes. Really yummy.. They allow for substitutions.  Not too many options on the menu. However the options they have satisfy many taste buds. I think there's another location make sure you choose the right one."}
{"text":"This has to be one of thee best breakfast spots in Metro Phoenix!  The service and the quality of food at the price point is out of this world!  Make this place somewhere you regular hit for breakfast."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had! You have got to try this place! I had the special today only substituted egg whites it is delicious!!!!! The iced tea is sooo yummy too!"}
{"text":"Food was good  I was pleasantly  surprised.  Walking in the place in doesn't  look like much  but it must be good as there weren't any empty tables in there.  But breakfast was very good  better than denny's  or ihop I will definitely  return."}
{"text":"Not kid friendly, despite Yelp's recommendation. There is no kid menu so the kids have to order adult portions at adult prices which is a waste of food and money. There is also no changing table in the bathroom for the youngest kids. This was disappointing and frustrating. Also, the bacon is not plain regular normal bacon. It's peppered bacon. Nowhere on the menu is this mentioned. It wasn't bad, my partner enjoyed it. But kids typically don't eat peppered anything so it was a waste of money to order it for them.  The waitstaff need to be assigned tables. It seems they have their waiters visit any and all tables which means guests are either being underserved or overserved. We had to ask three different times for water, but then we received two checks. It was just weird.  The food wasn't anything spectacular. I ordered a waffle which was really good. The breakfast sandwich was just ok.  Overall disappointing. Definitely wouldn't recommend or visit again."}
{"text":"Cant say much that hasnt been said already.  Matts serves some delicious breakfast.  Yes its small.  Yes theres a wait.  Yes its worth it!  Bring a newspaper or a book, sign your name in and chill out.  At least now they have added a few benches to relax on.  Once inside anything you order will be fresh and delicious.  From amazing waffles, to the freshest fruit, to the tastiest bacon.  If Im in the mood for a bomb breakfast and have some time to kill Matts is at the top of the list."}
{"text":"I loved this cute little place!! The food was amazing! Everything was organic and fresh. If you stop by here get their bacon! It's sooo sooo good! This place fills up pretty quick so if you are willing to wait, do it. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Service is so far above expectations at an airport.  Server April is a game changer.  Food is way beyond the norm.  Looks, smells, and tastes amazing.  Listen to the servers as to what you should order.  The house makes classics.  Oh, and \"good portions\" is not adequate.  Behemoth portions is the word, and for a great price."}
{"text":"The griddle cakes were the best I have ever had anywhere.  The chicken apple sausage was very tasty too.  The service is as good as the food.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why Matt's gets so much vitriol from some of these reviewers.  Maybe it's just the usual Food Network backlash?  In any case, Matt's makes a solid breakfast.  The home fries are seasoned with rosemary and taste great.  The much-hyped bacon really is good... it's the right balance between chewy, fatty, and crispy.  Eggs are always cooked up well and the portions are a decent size.  The coffee is good too.  The sandwiches for lunch are good too, and the BLT is the standout.  I've actually taken to ordering home fries instead of chips to go along with my lunches.  The only real downside i can think of is that it's sometimes packed, and it can be a  wait to get a table.  When it gets like this, the staff naturally tries to turn over their tables quickly.  It's good because the food comes out lightning fast, and good because your wait to get a seat isn't too long!  But it's not so great when you feel rushed.  That said, this is a really good breakfast, a solid lunch, and well worth a shot if you haven't been here before.  This isn't just Guy Fieri hype... it's good food and one of the better breakfast places in the Valley."}
{"text":"Found Matt's Big Breakfast while searching for restaurants in the area and Matt's popped up. We came in at 11am on Sunday doe NYE brunch and it was busy. There were probably 25 to 30 people waiting on benches outside of the restaurant. They provide complimentary flavored fruit water for waiting patrons. We checked in with the host inside with our name and number in our party. They call us by name when they are ready for us.  The aesthetics of the restaurant is amazing -- magazine pages worthy. They have several table options -- bar top and window seating for diners of one or two. There's also tables around the rest of the restaurant for two or more diners.   FOOD: - STEAK & EGGS ($15.95): the steak & eggs are Sunday's daily special. My 8 oz steak was cooked medium as I requested and I was surprised it came out cooked perfectly. The steak comes served with a side of A1 steak sauce. You also have a choice of either hash browns or home potatoes -- of course I opted for hash browns cooked well done for that extra crisp. The hash browns tasted exceptional and not commercialized. The inside was moist while the outside was crunchy and crisp. There was a lot of flavor in the hash browns. It goes great with their ketchup. My meal also comes with two eggs prepared any way you like -- over easy for me. It also comes with your choice of sourdough, white, or wheat bread and I opted for sourdough seeing how everyone else opted for that. I don't usually like eating bread, but I really enjoyed the sourdough bread. It comes out toasted and buttered. They also provide homemade preserves -- ask for the strawberry preserve. It's so good. They also sell it by the mason jar for $7 each. Soooo gooood. - CHEESE OMELET ($7.95): my friend really enjoyed his omelet. He added additions to the omelet such as spinach and roasted peppers for an additional $1.00 each. The omelet was huge and so cheesy. He requested hot sauce and they brought us Tapatio Hot Sauce -- yum. His meal also came with choice of potatoes and choice of bread. He opted for the home fries. Our server said the home potatoes are cooked with rosemary, olive oil, and other ingredients that I didn't catch. She made it sound so goood. I was able to try some and I would say it is the best home fries I have ever had. You don't really need ketchup because those home fries had so much flavor. - THICK CUT BACON ($3.50): we all love bacon, but the bacon here is out of this world! The bacon is thick cut and is lighted peppered with black pepper. The bacon was crisp and so good. You MUST order it.  SERVICE was okay. They were nice but very busy. Our drinks weren't delivered until our meals came which was maybe a 10 to 15 minute wait. They did clear our plates from our table right when we finished.   In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this gem of a restaurant to anyone visiting Downtown Phoenix. My friend said it was probably the best breakfast that he has ever had and I can't disagree. We ate like savages haha."}
{"text":"The service was great!  Didn't care for the blueberry lemonade (too tart for me) but the food was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Good customer service and the breakfast is good. We usually order the hog and chick and waffles."}
{"text":"Great service & love the home potatoes, bacon and waffles. Good coffee and great home made fresh honey lemonade a must have."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Food was delicious. Simple menu with great specials. Loved the strawberry jam. Home fries were amazing. Very busy. We had a big group of 11 and it's a small space but it was still family friendly and accomodating. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Matt's for breakfast.  I had to check out the hype and see if it is what everyone says it is!  I took my nieces with me and I wasn't sure if it was very kid friendly...let's say I wouldn't bring young ones there just because it is so small and there is no room to run around.  But since my gals are 10 and 11 there was no problem accommodating them.  They split the delicious belgian waffle.  Let me tell you this is the tastiest I have ever tried!!  Real maple syrup is the key and they serve the best.  All piping hot and fresh off the griddle (my mouth waters just thinking of it).  I ordered the egg sandwich with no bacon, so it was a fried egg with american cheese and sauteed onions.  Not the healthiest option but I really enjoyed it.  I am not sure what kind of bread it was on but it was soft and fantastic.  The fresh squeezed OJ is like eating a ripe orange and the coffee was very well made.  All in all I can see why people are willing to wait for a long time to eat here."}
{"text":"My girl friend and i went there on a crowded Saturday morning. Customer service wasn't great. Our server Leyva seemed somber and wasn't able to get us a glass of water. The pork chop was dry and tasted like chicken. The prices were ok. I would have been pissed if i had to pay more for the mediocre food."}
{"text":"Matt's Biggest Breakfast!   First time flying out of this terminal, decided to belly up to the bar here at Matt's. The gentleman beside me had three plates of food in front on him, each looked better than the burrito I was contemplating on the menu. I asked what he was having and learned it was \"Matt's Biggest Breakfast\". I'll have that!  A pile of scrambled real eggs, a huge pancake, fried potatoes, two sausage patties, two really thick slices of bacon with peppered edges, and I added toast.   Oh my, that wasn't only the best airport breakfast I've had, but may have been the best breakfast I've had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum....these guys know how to do it right. The potatoes are served hot and crispy, and they taste amazing. They know how to do a perfect poached medium egg. The service is fast and there's a counter if you need to eat in a jiffy. Great coffee, local biz....great place all around."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. They make their own jelly/jam, so that was pretty fun! Very busy, so it is hard to get in sometimes."}
{"text":"I can never decide..sweet or savory..so I usually get eggs, bacon, toast, hash browns and something sweet!!!!   I didn't see that as an option here..no side waffle..pancake   I got the hog and chick. Potatoes are gluey and only one egg was over easy.   The oj was warm the bread was okay..yeastey"}
{"text":"I really loved this place.  Our waiter was charismatic and attentive and fun!  The decor inside was cute and interesting to look at.  There were tvs to watch news or sports if you wanted.  The wait wasn't too bad-maybe 15 min at most.  The bacon was the best I've had!  My son got the kid's waffle and it was huge!  He ate every bite."}
{"text":"My girlfriend brought me here on Wednesday morning and it is now somewhere I can't wait to go back to. I had an order of pancakes which were good, I like drowning my pancakes in syrup but decided to control myself and just accept the one 2oz container that came with the plate. I also added to eggs on the side which were fine but decided to get a chicken apple sausage and man I am hooked! I haven't stopped thinking about it since we left (don't tell my girlfriend), it sounded like a weird combination but for some reason it works and it works well! I got a cup of coffee and our waitress was on point with the refills. My girl got French toast with a country sausage and a side of hash browns. The side order of has browns were huge and all of her food also tasted great. Really looking forward to coming back and trying other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Go early to avoid the wait. Excellent food and excellent service! Best organic apple juice. And fresh delicious food. Server Miranda is the best."}
{"text":"Amazing Breakfast... Farm fresh ingredients.. Friendly staff.  Had \"The Chop & Chick\" (highly recommend), come with a juicy pork chop, two eggs, hash browns or Rosemary Potatoes, and toast. Side of thick Peppered Bacon (Amazing).  Place was packed (not sure why people complain about things like this, it means it is really good), but no wait on a Thursday morning."}
{"text":"Spotty service - but friendly staff. Everything was fresh and great tasting. Order the ham off the bone."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the hype and excitement behind this place because there wasn't anything special about the food. Don't get me wrong, it was good but it definitely does not deserve all the attention it gets. If you're gonna do breakfast it's either gotta be flashy or tastes amazing and this was neither. Also, would it kill them to refill my water?   Oh but the bathroom was clean and parking wasn't bad at all so if you want to eat generic breakfast food, it is easily accessible."}
{"text":"Tasty twist on Simple menu, extremely fresh.  Food is top notch, service good as well.  This place is 5 stars.  Location much nicer than downtown as well.  Priced modestly."}
{"text":"I think Matt's has had its '5 minutes of fame'.  Note to owners: Your food is good enough,  your staff is great, so please save your money and move to a better location.  Right now, you're next to a rundown hotel with police baracade tape all over the place.The local residents(?) pan-handling all the waiting customers outside your place. Seriously?   Just sad.  Won't go again, won't recommend it either.  Good luck this summer, the heat will melt all your 'waiting area' customers out ."}
{"text":"Matts has one of the best breakfast menus in town and has for many years now.  The original location is by far the best one.  Nothing is really fancy or special but the food is always delicious.  Almost everything is made from scratch and locally sourced.  What is so unbelievable is that there are so many bad breakfast joints out there and all he is doing is fresh, local, and simple food.  Seriously how can nobody do this right out there?  My favorite is the egg benedict but it is only done on Wednesdays.  Pretty much everything on the menu is good but a few of my favorites are the waffle with the perfect mix, salty, savory, fresh, crisp yet fluffy.  Perfection.  Another favorite is the salami scramble.  Schreiner's sausage, eggs, onions, and cheese.  Always solid.  And another one that is really good is the 5 spot which is worth the six bucks.  A huge breakfast sandwich that tastes as good as it looks.  Everything else is just done right: thick crispy peppery bacon, thick sliced bread with homemade jam, fresh squeezed oj, homemade honey lemonade.  You really can't go wrong with anything.  The only thing that keeps me from giving them 5 stars is the service has always been hit or miss.  The first time I went many years ago the waitress was so rude I almost never came back.  The last few times we have been we have had to not only wait for our food but weren't offered refills on our drinks, weren't offered condiments, we finally went to other tables to get them, the food took forever, and the waitresses never bothered to check on us.    Understand-idly this place is packed and always has a line but refills, check ups, and condiments are very basic levels of service and should be part of any dine in experience regardless.  Part of the problem is the waiters don't have assigned tables.  The other part is they need to be trained better.    That aside Matts is still the best breakfast in town rivaled by none."}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time with high expectations.  Service was super slow and we sat at the counter.  The waitress recommended the pancakes, which were not good, dry and not fluffy as told.  Honestly have had better pancakes at McDonald's.   The hashbrowns are amazing though, a must try!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with friends and family. Great small café atmosphere and Decore parking is tight because they are doing road work around the restaurant. Great lunch and breakfast menu we came here for brunch and were delighted. Pancakes, omelettes, salads were delicious service was great we will be back"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said about this place, other than the fact that my dad was visiting from Mexico and found this place as he strolled through Downtown back when this place first opened and recommended it to me.  High wait times are WORTH THE WAIT. Even the water with lemon they have outside for you while you wait is delicious and satisfying. I always go for the special, and my oh my it has never disappointed. You can tell the difference between this place and other breakfast joint once you taste their food, its natural, organic, with lots of flavor and it smells fresh.  Their rosemary garlic potatoes are the best, their pancakes are a trip to Neverland, and their coffee is just as good as the one at a Starbucks.  This place has a special place in my heart because I remember going to it when the hype hadnt started and I hardly to wait to eat there at first, so I am glad for them because they really deserve all of the attention that they get for their delicious food. Plus, the owners wife always remembers me and even tells me she hasnt seen me in a long time when I go, its just a wonderful place that knows how to treat its customers and how to keep em happy."}
{"text":"I have been going there for years, and took my brother who was visiting from out of town and we were extremely disappointed in the service. We sat down and we had to wave at the wait staff after we were ignored for five minutes. We tried giving the wait staff a chance but it was all down hill from there. Disappointed especially after going there for years."}
{"text":"The hours posted here are incorrect, they were open at 9pm when I got to the airport.  I just had one of the best breakfast burritos of my life here! Asked for well done bacon and it was perfectly cooked and so thick, jalapeños were a great addition too! The man working at the counter was super friendly and the prices are very reasonable for such delicious airport food!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, as it's directly downstairs from where I work, but so far I've been very impressed. The service is friendly - Daniel in particular has been a great help, always had a smile on his face. Today, for example, they were running a little behind and so I was offered a complimentary lemonade due to the wait, which was still only about 10 minutes, so not bad at all. The food is also really tasty - the menu isn't anything complex, basic breakfast and lunch, but it's done well. Definately recommend if you want bite in the area - also good parking, which is helpful in this part of town."}
{"text":"If you want great quality food thats made with love this is the place! Simple , delicious food with home made recipes.  The place is absolutely beautiful and located in the stunning Marina Heights buildings."}
{"text":"Bad service. Bought the food from the cashier. Thought i can sit down to eat. But it's a to go order so they said no you can't sit down to eat even though the restaurant is empty. Sub-standard service."}
{"text":"I never thought I would say this, but I recently had a breakfast better than one consumed at Matt's.  It's best not to go any further.  That being said, whenever I am off on a weekday, the urge to go to Matt's emerges at the crack of dawn and does not subsist until I have either satiated myself with hash browns at their tiny digs or have painfully decided to deny myself the rich excess.  The wait is almost always 45 minutes even if you are a party of 1.  Going later helps reduce the wait.  Sometimes.  The wait though only builds the appetite and anticipation.  This is food that deserves such dedication.  I almost exclusively get the special.  And they are all special.  However, the most special of all specials was my first and one that I hope will make a comeback soon.  Imagine for yourself: Chicken Artichoke Sausage, Fresh Mozzarella, Organic Spinach (locally grown, mind you), Hash Browns, and Whole Wheat Toast (with some local fruit preserves that they like to give a lot of props to when they deliver it to you).  Also, cheers to the wait staff who work frantically in such a small space.  I also appreciate their sort of Mother Hubbard, pseduo-indie, partially jeans and a t-shirt dress code."}
{"text":"After hearing all of the hype on diners, drive in and dives and reading the yelp ratings, we decided to try it.  We waited over 30 minutes  for a table.  The place is small and outside of a dungy motel.  The service was extremely fast once you got in the door and the waitstaff are very friendly.  I had a waffle and it was good but nothing memorable.  My partner had an omelette with portguese sausage that he loved.  The hash browns were so buttery and they were good.    I wouldn't make a special trip back."}
{"text":"I visited Phoenix for the first time a couple months ago because my friend moved out west. Being a big Diners, Drive In's, and Dives fan, I decided I need to try a couple spots since Guy almost always ends up in Phoenix or Bakersfield, CA every episode. I specifically remembered on the plane the episode with Matt's Big Breakfast...it's amazing what you remember, considering that episode first aired 5+ years ago.  For the daytime portion of my trip, I was alone to discover what Phoenix has to offer as my friend had to work. I'm completely fine with that, and the morning after my arrival I set my off to find Matt. I was pleasantly surprised to find it was only about a 20 minute walk from my hotel, which was perfect considering the weather was 60 with a slight wind. (I didn't know Phoenix had wind!?)  I arrived shortly after 10am to a filled restaurant. Luckily I was by myself so the hostess was able to seat me almost immediately at the bar. I had decided on the Skinny, but the scramble of the day was almost the same but with a different sausage. I decided to go with the daily special and waited only 10 minutes tops for my food. I was surprised by their ability to get food out to me; perhaps their motto of serving simple food makes it easier to serve food fast? Whatever the case, I was very impressed. The scramble, along with the accompanied potatoes and sourdough, were hot and delicious. The scramble was flavorful without being too cheesy, and everything was seasoned perfectly. I didn't add salt or pepper to my meal, and it's very rare that I don't.   They live up to the name of Matt's Big Breakfast - for some reason I took my leftovers home even though I had no intention of eating them.  (Not because they weren't delicious, but I was only there for 4 days! I had many places to eat at!) Guy Fieri, thank you good sir, you done good man, you done good."}
{"text":"Very busy, but still quick and attentive service coupled with great food...the place is a winner.  It is relatively small so expect a wait on weekends.  I will go back, and I can recommend that you give it a try, too!"}
{"text":"I moved out of town and I cry a little each time I want go to out to breakfast and there is no Matt's around.   Seriously the best breakfast spot I've ever had in six states."}
{"text":"In town to visit some family.  This spot is great!  very small seat area.  The food is amazing.  I had the pork chop, Yum! Kids had the waffles.  Honestly the best things i tasted were the bacon and the pancake.  Staff was very helpful considering my family put them through their paces ( not taking them again - they don't deserve it)."}
{"text":"Been here too many times! Big, greasy, Scrumdiddlyumptious breakfast!!! Good vibes, excellent service and delish home made food!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry Matt, but things are going downhill at least at this location. The breakfast today was a bit of a disaster and the menu is way too small.  Bacon - undercooked and chewy Creamer - curdled upon entry into coffee Coffee - burnt, way too strong Potatoes - drenched in about 1/2 cup of Olive Oil Waffle - powdered sugar was over used, white waffle Omelette - best of the bunch Toast - forgotten until halfway through meal  Matt don't care anymore because he has five locations now. Profits matter more than good food now."}
{"text":"I bet the food is great. It's too bad we didn't get to that point. My friend an I arrived a few minutes before meeting our other friend so we sat at the bar because we were kinda in a hurry. We saved her a seat and expected her any minute. Now, as far as I've ever been told about dining customs, is that the bar, whether it be one that actually serves booze or what, is open seating and can't be reserved and the host can't make you give it up. Two other girls walked in and wanted a booth but the host told them to sit at the bar instead. We told the girls we were saving this one seat for our friend and the host came over and rudely said, \"YOU ARE NOT SAVING THIS SEAT!\" As our friend walks in. The other girls were like hey, it's all good, we wanted a booth anyways and he MADE US sit here. Rude as FFFFFFFFF. We were confused. But hey, Jobot is just a block away and I suggest you try their chorizo biscuits and gravy because it's AMAZING."}
{"text":"Breakfast perfection!   Everything was spot-on perfect....  Worth the wait (and there always is a wait)...  Fresh ingredients, made-from-scratch delish breakfast is THE BEST BREAKFAST in  metro Phoenix...."}
{"text":"Good food, great drinks, and even better service! I had a couple lovely ladies serving me and keeping me company as I was flying alone and arrived to the airport way too early! The only thing about this place that bothered me was their god awful uniforms! Those shirts would be better worn for servicing the plane over serving me drinks."}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast in AZ. Their bacon is the best you can get. Oh and the hashbrowns! The hashbrowns are yukon gold potatoes and they are crunchy and a little soft in the middle and just melt in your mouth. The service is amazing. Everyone that works there is super nice and the owners are always there to great their customers. If you're in town you must stop by."}
{"text":"Staff is great- friendly and efficient. The quality of the food is amazing. Everything was very fresh and came out a lot faster than anticipated. The restaurant was very busy but we had no problem getting a table in about 15 min."}
{"text":"We'd always wanted to try this place out, especially after it gained fame on The Travel Channel. It's a literal hole in the wall in downtown Phoenix that's known for fabulous breakfast and endless waits.   \"Matt's Big Breakfast on N. First St. is a popular diner that serves heaping plates of Chop and Chick (pork chops and eggs). A local favorite, the small dining room fills up fast causing a line of early birds to pour out onto the street.\" - the Travel Channel  Everything about this place could be described as, well, cute. The yellow door, tiny juice glasses with roosters on them, vintage art on the walls, even the waitress aprons.   My bf ordered the special; a concoction of eggs, hashbrowns and Andouille sausage in a hearty sauce. I opted for the waffle that came with A. the best butter I've ever had and B. some bacon.   The service was lightening fast once we were seated and the food was tasty. My waffle was by far the winner of our two entrees.  Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Doubtful. Am I glad I got to experience it? Very."}
{"text":"Solid little place. Food was great with a very generous portion and servers were fantastic. Very friendly and inviting"}
{"text":"This place is very good.  We came on a Saturday afternoon and were sat within 5 seconds.  No joke!  The decor is trendy urban with the concrete floors orange walls exposed brick and vents. Love the corrugated aluminum walls outside.  Service was quick and on point.  Very friendly!  The food was more than aqueduct. The omelette was very filling and the sourdough toast with jam was great!"}
{"text":"All the morons who think this is the airport location...your wrong. Ok, it has been a few years since my last visit, but seriously nothing has changed and that is good. The joint still had a wait at 10:30 Am (less than 10 minutes) and the waffles are still tops in town. Of course the bacon ain't too shabby either. It's just a unique waffle that is somewhere between a lolo version and a real Belgium variety. Just soft and buttery, a must try if waffles are or even aren't your thing. Only $7.50 for a filling meal, but you likely will have to wait, so try coming at some off peak hour. Park at deSoto market for free parking."}
{"text":"Just popped in for a quick bite and glass of wine between flights.... the bartender was wonderful -- fast and attentive, but not intrusive and the grilled cheese w tomato soup was probably the best decision I've made all day.  It could stand to have a little bit more cheese, but totally delicious-hits-the-spot-comfort-food otherwise.   The only thing that I found to be bad was he host -- a young man. He was looking down at his phone and did not look up at all as I approached nor as I was standing in front of him. He asked \"bar or table\" without even looking up but completed his text message. I waited for him to at least make eye contact at which point he asked me again, \"bar Or table\" in a tone that made me feel as though I was seriously inconveniencing him."}
{"text":"I went here after an overnight shift because it was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. I thought the food was decent and good. Not spectacular but for a dive it was fine. It is very small and can get fairly packed adding to the character. I didn't get to see Matt but would return for basic breakfast food.    Visited April 2012"}
{"text":"I feel kinda silly writing about a place that already has over 200+ amazing reviews, but this is the internet and goddamnit, my opinion matters. But its true.. All 200+ rave reviews are spot on...   Matts. Is. The. Shit.   If it weren't for the long-ass wait in the three thousand degree AZ summer heat, I'd probably be there on a regular, but sorry dudes, I am a ginger kid, and I burn. I also have no soul, but you all already knew that.  Anyway.  I was skeptical for, ohhh, about a year... yes, it took me that long to actually muster up the patience to deal with the wait.. but I have very persuasive friends who have really good ideas., so last Saturday, I went, and the fact that its been almost a week since i've tasted the sweet spuds in their hashbrowns makes me want to cry. They are seriously, one of the most delicious things ive ever eaten. I got the Chop & Chick.. because i love pigs and eating them. The pork was perfect, nicely seasoned, tender and delicious. I got my eggs over medium, because egg yolk is one of my favorite things to dip shit in, and an order of home fries because the waitress said the hash browns were \"kinda funky, not like usual\", that day.. but she lied. or maybe she didn't, but my friend got them and either way, they were amazing. My friends got the 5 spot (breakfast sandwich thing) & the daily special (some chorizo mexicany mash up of yum), which were both equally amazing, but for real, my yolk covered pork chop superseded anything those fools were eating. Its been on my mind for days.  As usual, I drank way too much coffee, but what I should have done was order a chocolate milk like my good friend Georgie S. had.. For whatever reason, it was better than any other chocolate milk in the universe.  Its small, cramped, kinda retro, no booze and there is no bathroom.. but whatever, I like places like this. its totally worth it, and did I mention its CHEAP?!  Go here at least once in your life. Make sure to get the HB's and visit The Downtown Phoenix Farmers Market across the street when you're finished. Its the perfect way to start your Saturday."}
{"text":"Our experience was only alright but the owners did take care of us afterward.  I could taste the quality of the food but we came on a Sunday morning which I don't advise."}
{"text":"The food was good. I had mamacito burger and a local beer. There were perfect. The burger is a little bit spicy, but i love spicy food. So no big deal.  I had coleslaw for the side. I didnt like it i wish i had something else.   The service was a little bit slow for the airport. Others than that were good."}
{"text":"I finally had the opportunity to go eat here. The first time I tried was on a weekend and there was a line around the block. This time I went to lunch with some coworkers. It's a small but cozy place. The wait staff was friendly, but when asked to have waters in the larger glasses then what was provided it seemed to start a confusing conversation. In the end larger glass waters were achieved! The food came very quickly. I forgot what it was called in the menu, however I tried their scrambled eggs, country potatoes extra crispy, and it came with thick cut peppered bacon. The eggs were delicious, the bacon was good but at some points seemed almost too thick, and what seems to be the case is  not truly extra crispy potatoes, but they were still very good. My coworkers wanted pancakes, so we ordered their griddle cakes, which came with 3, so we could each have one. I was already full, but that griddle cake was delightful. Overall I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a tasty breakfast. It hit all the marks for a nice breakfast for lunch treat! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Only reason for a one rating is that I could not give a zero. That is because I was not  able to eat because I left because of the terrible service.  No one at the door seating guests... the waitress lecturing about needing to wait to be seated at an empty bar and half empty restaurant. People lined up at the door waiting to be seated while waitress stands behind the counter doing nothing. Beware: The place is operated by millennial snow flakes that need a safe space to hide if someone says anything to them..."}
{"text":"Got here around 11:45 on a Saturday morning. You put your name on a list but they don't quote wait times. It ended up taking about 20 minutes.  We ordered a 5 spot, a chop and chick, and a hog and chick. Food came really fast, within 10 minutes. The bacon is some of the best bacon I have ever had. It is thick and has great flavor. The hash browns might have been the best thing on the plate. Buttery and just enough salt. The sourdough bread was soft and sour and with some of the jam it was the perfect bite.  From being seated to leaving it only took like 30 minutes. It's fast and delicious."}
{"text":"We checked this place out after seeing it on the Food Network and it was delicious. The rosemary potatoes are top notch and the strawberry jam would be great on almost anything."}
{"text":"Would love to tell you about the food but I stood at the entry for a few minutes and then left. No sign about seating yourself or waiting. No employee made eye contact. Guess they don't need our business."}
{"text":"Quite literally the best breakfast I have ever had. I had the French Toast special today and my mouth has never been so happy. I think I had a foodgasm. In addition to the amazingly flavorful food, the ambience was really cool inside and the entire staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The owner herself even came out to see if we had any questions!  This place is the best."}
{"text":"Service sucks sooooooo bad. I waited 25 minutes for a bowl of chili? Really? Did they have to hunt a cow? I mean you scoop it in a bowl and you serve it. It should only take 5 minutes but 25 minutes???? I walked out. Oh and by the way I told my waitress I've been waiting for 25 minutes---- she said ok. No apologies. Wow! Avoid it like a plague."}
{"text":"Always the best! Love Matts Big Breakfast! I go here with my mother and then to Easleys Fun Shop for Halloween shopping. It's a tradition."}
{"text":"Very limited menu but seems to work in your favor because everything there is delicious."}
{"text":"Yes, yes.  This place is awesome.  The other reviewers are right and have covered the details.  In order to not waste your time, I'll keep it short and simple.   - Best pancakes I've ever had.  - Bacon was quite delicious.  - Spectacular, thick cuts of bread for the toast.  - Yummy, homemade jam.  - Quick and friendly service.  - Don't forget to ask for your to-go cup of coffee.  I went on a Friday morning, and we only waited 5 minutes for a table of four.  Like \"they\" say, this place is small so it's going to fill up quick on the weekends.  Not sure about you, but I instantly think, \"What can I do to avoid the wait?\"  Here's my tip . . . find a reason to go out to breakfast on a weekday.  Plan a \"business breakfast\" with some co-workers (we do \"business lunch\" all the time . . . why not breakfast?).  Or pick a day when you can go in an hour or two late and have a friend meet you.  Make it a birthday breakfast for your signification other, parent, or sibling.  Whatever the reason . . . just find one!  It's a nice way to mix up the regular weekly routine with something fun and treat yourself at the same time.    And trust me, Matt's is worth it!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the service wasn't very good and we sat at the bar. It was hard to get hot water for my tea or coffee refills. There was very little attention given to everyone who was sitting at the bar. There was not that many people there so there was no reason for the lack of service. Out of the other locations this was the worst service."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. They're very quick with their service. Always have unique specials that you do not want to skip out on. Homemade preserves for sale are especially worth it."}
{"text":"yep, good ol' simple home cooking, and by 'home cooking' i mean back when no one cared that there was about three cups of butter in per serving.  if you've never gone, don't be scared off by all the butter references, it's not that bad. the place is teeny tiny, and our table of two had to wait about 10 minutes for a place, parties of more than four, you'll probably have to get split up.   the omelettes are wonderful, and the rosemary home fries are too good. the bacon is so good.. i can't even describe it. let me stress i am NOT a pork fan, and rarely eat it. i never eat bacon from a restaurant since i'm so picky about it. everyone raved about it here, so i dived in and thought, 'what have i been missing my whole life?' ha ha, yeah, i has an awakening of pork love right in the middle of the joint! seriously, it's unbelievable. it's worth the trek no matter where you're coming from, especially on a sat morning. afterward we checked out a small famer's market that was going on right up the street, and then popped in Circles records and tapes, also within walking distance.  ***Update 3/8 I just went over the weekend and we waited more than 45 minutes. i was ok with it, but i was with someone who does not really place value on waiting a little longer for great food, which kind of put a damper on things. def do not bring someone here who is not willing to wait for a good thing."}
{"text":"I'll qualify this review up front: all I ever ask for in a breakfast is a pile of extra crispy hash browns and two to three eggs, over easy.  I put the eggs on top, dump some salt, pepper, and tabasco on there, and mix it all up.  If you learn nothing else from me, learn this: that is the way to start the day.  Having said that, damn does Matt's have some good hashbrowns and eggs.  But I give it extra credit for having delicious looking pancakes, which I've never eaten, and some really damn good honey lemonade.  I had pork chops and eggs there, and I've had the T-bone and eggs there, but the meats are really just a distraction from what I love so much."}
{"text":"Really delicious breakfast. Super cute location and friendly staff! We'll definitely be back to try more things"}
{"text":"Order the Waffle and get a glass of orange juice. Eat some bacon and have some of that bread with jelly. If I started my morning like this, it would be a great day!  The only problem with the place is not a lot of seating so there is always a wait. Other than that you have the best breakfast in town."}
{"text":"You could tell this was a popular place just based on how many people were waiting outside.  Even with all of the people waiting, the wait wasn't too long.  We might have waited for 20 minutes around noon with 6 parties in front of us.  Their menu is short, but they get bonus points for offering breakfast all day.  I decided to go with a basic breakfast of 2 eggs, toast, bacon and home fries.  Now I usually love hash browns, but the home fries were delicious.  If you don't like grilled onions and black pepper, then you might want to skip the fries.  Bacon was also pretty peppered, but I thought it was tasty.  So why not 5 stars?  The service was average. Nothing particularly good or bad.  They were efficient, I will give them that.  If the service was great, I would have added that last star."}
{"text":"In town for business and my colleague took me to Matt's. As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a smiling face. We were served by yet another smiling face. Then both smiley faces tag teamed to make the service superb. The food was amazing and the thick cut bacon was actually meat and not fat and the taste was awesome. I highly recommend Matt's!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just left and it was not very good. We went because I saw it on Diners Drive in and Dives and had really high expectations. We first got there the guy at the counter was nice, but when we sat we did not get very good service. I had the chop and chick. The pork chop and eggs were okay, but the potatoes were not good. My husband had pancakes and bacon. The pancakes were really good which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1. The bacon had a lot of pepper which we didn't know it had pepper at all. The orange juice was fresh squeezed which was the one good review I could give. I don't know if it was a fluke that we had a bad experience, but we will not be going back. We spent almost 40 dollars and I couldn't eat most of it. I would prefer to go to Denny's!!"}
{"text":"If you love a classic American breakfast, Matts is the best in Phx hands down. I've only been once, mostly because its downtown and the long lines. All their ingredients are local, organic, and farm raised. Their bacon is something I always tell people to try. Its insanely thick and peppered to perfection! I would go there just for a side of bacon! Their toast is thick and baked fresh. Even their OJ is fresh squeezed. I wish I lived downtown because I would go here every weekend!"}
{"text":"The standards for an airport restaurant are pretty low. Just some food in a clean place. But don't expect to be greeted nicely...at all. And don't expect an item listed as a \"Tossed Cobb Salad\" to not be tossed, served in a pile with cold fatty bacon, and dressing on the side.   But the worst part was the amazingly grouchy hostess. Have you seen the Seinfeld episode with the soup Nazi? Picture that. Super rude...lately me rephrase that SUPER RUDE!!! I mentioned it to the waitress who told me that I need to give her a break because it was only her third or fourth day on the job. I thought, are you kidding me? This is how she behaves and she JUST started there? What will her behavior be like after she gets tired of being there.  To be clear, I was in a really good mood when I got there. I had the perfect amount of time for a layover, had a great flight and a great business trip, I wasn't too concerned about the price as my meals were being covered by my clients. I smiled and tried to be friendly and she was just a grouch. I have no idea what her problem was but projecting it on me was unprofessional and just unkind.  A hostess is \"paid\" to be friendly. That IS their job. To kindly greet guests, warm them up for the waiter, and then find an appropriate seat.  Honestly, the server wasn't much better. She had a \"mildly pissy\" attitude. Not as bad as the other.  I gave this 2 stars and I'm not sure why I even gave that many. I guess 1 1/2 would be appropriate but I'm feeling generous.  I'm pretty sure that the restaurant won't contact me but I wish they would.  If you're stuck in the airport, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I am so sad. You see, we have nothing like Matt's in the San Francisco Peninsula.   My wife said it perfectly as we were eating an orgasmically great breakfast there yesterday morning. \"There are places that serve breakfast. And this is most places. And then there are those food establishments that pay homage to the very art of a hearty American breakfast.\" THIS is Matt's.   Oh, and the service is great too. For breakfast as an event, I can't imagine a better place. And not that you care, but I had steak and eggs with succulent crispy hash browns and buttery delicious sourdough toast. The steak was perfect. And the teeny cup of A1 sauce on the side? Way to keep it classy.  Their bacon is crispy thick peppery goodness. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank my five year old daughter for not eating her bacon.  And now I'm starting to weep again.  THE END"}
{"text":"I decided to take a nice long bike ride along Tempe Town Lake. I needed some refueling and remembered that this place is along the route.  The menu here is somewhat limited providing maybe 8-10 options for breakfast. I seem to be a creature of habit, so again, I order the skinny breakfast consisting of 4 egg whites with apple sausage, tomatoes, cheese (I request easy) and a salad with vinegarette on the side. Very fresh and yummy.  I also got a hot coffee with almond milk as a substitute for cream. By the way, the coffee here is a locally roasted brew and it is rich and Delish!!!  As for the service?.....always very accommodating, friendly and fast. Our server was more than willing to make sure our experience was above and beyond.  The atmosphere is clean and modern. They also offer outdoor seating with a nice view with ample seating.   I recommend this place especially if you're out and about exploring the lake or taking in an event at the ASU stadium across the street."}
{"text":"I would like to share my recent experience dining at this establishment.  To give you a bit of background, I found Matt's Big Breakfast off Yelp months ago and my sister and I visited the location they have in downtown Phoenix.  I read the reviews and although most people spoke about the long wait time, but how worth it to still visit, was definitely something worth trying out.  I absolutely fell IN LOVE with the breakfast that I had (salami scramble w/cheese, side of sausage and home fries ...bomb.com)  I've visited that location twice and never had a problem.  Recently I was visiting my sister in the East Valley of Phoenix and she began craving Matt's Big Breakfast.  I said, Ok...let's do it.  To my surprise they have a new location that opened up about 10 months ago (I was told) and we were excited about trying it out.  Here are the Pro's and Con's:  Pro's:  This location is much bigger than the location downtown.  I loved the scenery, the waterfall and the outside seating.  I absolutely love the open kitchen which allows you to watch your food being made.  Our server Michelle was AMAZING (more details about her in a bit).  Con's:  We were served our drinks in plastic cups and not glasses like everyone else.  My sister elected to order the Steak and Eggs breakfast, but she could not because they ran out of steak.  It would have been nice to know this information when we were given our menus to look over.  It's on the menu, so how come you don't have it available for a customer to purchase?  She then selected home fries, cheesy eggs and 3 pancakes.  She did not like the pancakes.  I again ordered my usual, salami scramble with home fries and side of sausage.  My home fries came out cold.  I asked the waiter if they could give me some more and they used a top broiler of some kind to heat it up because they do not have a microwave.  When our server Michelle came by to ask how our food was, I told her that it was just alright, nothing special.  After telling her what was wrong, she immediately took my plate away without further request and had them remake the whole meal.  She explained to me that my happiness is what matters to her and that is what I call some damn good customer service.  When my plate arrived, my potatoes were hot, cheese melted on my salami scramble.  That remake, but most importantly her eagerness to satisfy me is what allowed me to give this place a 2 star.  I hoped that my experience would have been better because this location is close to my job and I would have planned to visit more.  Would I go again, probably not.  I would travel to the downtown location if I ever crave Matt's again.  I hope that one day I can update my review with something much better for this location if I do visit again  They seem to be new and getting things together so I won't bash them for that.  I wish them the best and hope it gets better."}
{"text":"Love this place.  My FAVORITE breakfast spot....hands down!!!  The portions are great and the food is greater.  I have several friends wanting to check this place out when they come to town just because of a picture I posted on Facebook.  Keep up the good work Matt's Big Breakfast.  I am a fan and will continue to be one as long as you keep making my stomach proud."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! I finally got to have breakfast here. We heard about the lines so we left early and got there at 6:30 am. I am thankful for the storefront pictures on Yelp because we could easily drive by without realizing that was it. They had a nice parking lot behind which, when crowded, when it often is, can be hard to maneuver out because it only has one entry.  We were greeted and seated immediately! Yay for the early birds. The homemade preserves in the little cooler looked so appetizing. Our host graciously told us that when we got toast with our breakfast, a sampling of those preserves also came with our meal.  My husband and I enjoyed the daily special, the Chorizo Scramble. Because it came with a tortilla and not toast, we thought we'd better order toast and the preserves. No regrets! The toast and preserves were AMAZING! The sourdough toast was nicely buttered and crunchy. The preserves were just the perfect blend of tart and sweet. Our scramble was good. I loved my raspberry honey lemonade. It was heavenly. When I have a sore throat, can someone give me the recipe, pleeeease?  Everyone else polished off their breakfasts at our table. The consensus was the home fries were tastier than the hashbrowns. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ok, someone please explain something to me, WHAT ON EARTH HAS MADE THIS PLACE SO POPULAR????? I went to check this place out after seeing it on DDD. It looked interesting and the food looked like it could be pretty good. Well, not to sound mean or anything but, I can make much better breakfast in my own kitchen for about half the price. Any Denny's in America makes a better breakfast and you don't have to wait in line for an hour and a half either. Im sorry but I just don't get it. The only thing that \"wasn't\" completely average was the bacon. The portions were WAY to small and the food was WAY, WAY over priced. \"Good food, good portion size, good price\". This place breaks all 3 of those rules. Come on people lets stop following the crowd and lets try and open our minds a little. If everyone would do that I don't think Matts would be in business much longer."}
{"text":"Omgoodness!  Simple breakfast done right!  You literally can taste the quality & freshness. Even the ketchup was exceptional. I had The Hog and the Chick - 2 eggs, bacon, home fries, toast. The average breakfast but Wonderful!  Really fresh eggs scrambled just right - not too hard, not too soft. Thick wide slices of sweet peppery bacon which had less fat. Oh my, the home fries. Chunks of potatoes with onions, some with crispy edges, some without. Thick slices and of sourdough toast with delicious butter served with blueberry preserves. It seemed as if the blueberries were picked yesterday. And not too sweet. The perfect breakfast to say the least. The guy next to me had the Sirloin steak that he said was fabulous. I also ordered the Strawberry Lemonade. I almost drank the whole glass full on my first sip. Go there you will not be disappointed. All fresh local food."}
{"text":"What a simple breakfast menu and yet the food taste nowhere near simple! There was just something about the food that made it one of the best breakfasts I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in my life. I've never been a huge breakfast food person but this place showed me what I was missing. This place is absolutely phenomenal. You MUST try!"}
{"text":"I got the 5 spot sandwich with a side of home fries, which were heavy on rosemary. The sandwich was tasty (can't go wrong with bacon). Wife got the pancakes, which were good. Our friend got the oatmeal, which was really soupy. Small menu."}
{"text":"Amazing service. I got seated pretty quickly and was impressed by how friendly and attentive the staff was (not only to me, but also to the people around me). Food was good, not the best I've had but still pretty good for the price. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food, long wait but if you are in good company it's worth the wait. I love the pancakes, they are sooooooo good. Their bacon is just the right thickness and crispiness."}
{"text":"I am not a huge breakfast person but when I am out of town I like to fuel up and indulge!   Matt's is the place to do so in downtown Phoenix. This place gets busy so expect a wait, but don't leave, you'll regret it. The menu is rather simple and short but the food is top notch. I had the Hog & Chick which was scrambled eggs, homefries, thick cut bacon, and sourdough bread. The difference between this place and a million other run-of-the mill breakfast places is that Matt's pays attention to the very last detail. The breads, the jellies, the lemonades, ect are all homemade and delicious! The freshness and attention to detail will have me craving their breakfast til the next time."}
{"text":"* There will be a wait. * It will be crowded. * It will be loud. * The food will be worth it.  I came here on my birthday. On my wedding day. On the first day of the year. Whenever I have a friend in town. Whenever I wake up early. Whenever I'm hungover. Whenever anyone mentions breakfast... There's just never a wrong time to eat the most perfect waffle ever created."}
{"text":"I love the high quality food at this location but the home fries that many have cheered about lacked taste. I appreciate that the food is all natural and that they cook everything in butter, but the food is not mind blowing tasty.   The staff is really friendly and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"First time grabbing a late breakfast at this downtown spot. We ordered our food and within only a few minutes, I had an amazing Belgium waffle with 2 thick, peppered slabs of bacon sitting before my very eyes. I barely had time to squeeze my lemon slice into my passionfruit iced tea before this feast sat before me.   After I had lightly buttered and drizzled a fourth of my waffle with syrup, I ceremoniously cut a generous piece out and placed it in my mouth. Seriously, my taste buds didn't know what to do. This was one of the best waffles I've had in my life. After my brain had sufficient time to process what was going on with my tongue and this heavenly piece of Belgium, I relentlessly devoured the rest of the waffle in a matter of minutes. I swear people must have thought I was in a food eating contest.   Then it came time to eat the bacon. After a mere nibble from a corner of one of the slices, the two slices that originally came atop my waffle simply teleported into my stomach. Yeah, that's how good the bacon is. It can teleport. Needless to say, I will be finding any excuse to eat here again in the very near future (i.e. tomorrow)."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was super fast. I'm trying the verde rancheros next time."}
{"text":"OMG - eggs Benedict special was amazing! I usually try to eat somewhat well, sauce on the side, eat half, cancer causing sweetener. All that went out the window when i walked in there this morning. Luckily there was a short wait and it was a great day out! Put your name on the list by the door. Don't come into the restaurant unless you know you should - it's too small!!  The staff is amazingly friendly and down to earth! We were seated promptly when called, got coffee and oj (order the double oj, small is really just a taste!)  Hubby did the Hog and Chix - mmmm! Bacon looked amazing. Bread is thick cut and comes with fabulous strawberry rhubarb jelly. Mmmm! I did the Benedict and it was amazing - did i mention it was amazing? The sauce, oh the sauce. The ham The home made english muffin - smothered in butter...  yes my arteries are clogging as i write this...  but wow! The home fries with the caramelized onions. The coffee with the organic raw sugar.  Amazing!  Cute little location. Limited parking - but we walked so it didn't effect us much. Short menu, but super yummy!"}
{"text":"Not the Matt's it use to be. Hash browns greasy, eggs not done right. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Matt's so my expectations were pretty high. They have a very simple approach and their menu seemed very natural and homemade  which I liked. I honestly think that's what adds to their charm. The bacon is thick and very tasty. My husband loved the home made strawberry preserves, we even asked if they sell it to take home but they were out. I plan on going back and buying some when they have more in stock. All in all it was good but OBH still continues to be my favorite bfast place in PHX."}
{"text":"I was disappointed too.  I waited an hour and then took at seat at the counter which is ok with me, but if you've got long legs your only option is to sit spread-eagled in order to get close enough to your plate and there's not that much legroom to each side.  In the small space in front of the counter the staff was in perpetual motion squeezing past each other to get drinks, etc.   My cheddar, jalepeno, sausage omelette was very good, but not huge, and the hash browns were crisp and tasty on the outside but soggy on the inside.  The whole wheat toast was great, but no choice of toppings...I was given a small dollop of peach preserves.  The waffles next to me looked fabulous, but I'm not a fan.   Basically I didn't think it wasn't worth the hour wait in 100 degrees and I was relieved to get outside where there was some breathing room."}
{"text":"wow! i did not know i could get a great meal, and an attitude change at the airport! my flight was delayed, do i was going to miss my connection.... when i walked into \"Matt's Big Breakfast!\" my server greeted me, like i was his best friend and intuitively knew i needed a BlOODY MARY, with BACON! so now that my mood is getting better, i order an omelet, OMG, this is the best bacon i have ever had! my server was as efficient as he was HILARIOUS! i had heard the rumors about Matt's Big Breakfast, now i am a believer! Michael! ask for MICHAEL!"}
{"text":"The waitress was very rushed. She didn't wait until I was done ordering before asking others at my table for their orders. I enjoyed my scramble and hash browns, but was disappointed when the description of my plate included toast but \"it actually doesn't come with toast.\" I had to order an extra side of it, and when it came, it was just two plain slices of bread."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious especially the fresh squeezed lemonade with honey is on spot!!!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Matt's.  Sat for ten minutes with four workers walking right past us not even acknowledging our existence.  Not even a glass of water! Portions were tiny!! and tasteless.  Definitely did not live up to the hype!"}
{"text":"Wow this is good breakfast food! I am so impressed with the food scene in Phoenix, it really could rival Philly or New York pretty soon. So I got the strawberry honey lemonade (divine!), pancakes (HUGE for 1 order- my boyfriend and I could have split one order, live and learn) and hash browns. I was so full I barely touched the hash browns and could not remember why I ordered them- I felt I needed them, for some reason. But they come in the shape of a pizza slice with a crunchy outer crust. Matt's Little Breakfast it certainly was not but we were thrilled to discover this place in our quest for pancakes!"}
{"text":"The Home Fries are to die for!  No...the Chipotle Sausage is to die for!!!  Forget it...I died and went to breakfast heaven!  You can tell the place is worth the try, by the lines and the fact that people are more than willing to wait.  Nice local experience, worth the trip. I would definitely go back!  Oh yea, they said goodbye to me by my first name...awww, they remembered (nice personal touch!)"}
{"text":"Ernie is a sweetheart! Food is great. I frequent here a lot. I always get the Hog'n Chick. Sometimes I get the special. I love the bread, preserves, the peppered bacon. AND THE HOME FRIES! Sometimes, the fries are not consistent. They may be too soggy with butter or done too well  but, in general, AWESOME! I am glad they moved and have restrooms now! I am glad to see they are open in the airport. Blessings and success to you all! :)"}
{"text":"This place was excellent ! We came in on a Tuesday morning - there was a bowl game at Chase field so it was fairly busy. Our wait was around 25-30 minutes. Coffee was good and food was even better ! I had a basic eggs and bacon plate with hash browns and it was very good. The other people in my party had biscuits and gravy and waffles. I should have ordered the biscuits and gravy because these looked amazing ! Service was outstanding and the food lived up to the hype ! If ever in downtown Phoenix check this place out !"}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito I just had was not good. Besides being tasteless, it was dry and the cooks terribly burned the potatoes. The fresh squeezed orange juice also tasted like it was made from green unripe oranges. Maybe worth another shot some day but today was not a good experience."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would.   Absolutely the worst lunch experience my two friends and I have ever had.   We all have a rough day at work, but it is all in how you handle the bad situation.  The restaurant  manager was clueless.  Sat for 50 minutes and still no Lunch   Asked them to make it to go. That took another ten minutes.  Took it to go and two of our sandwiches were disappointing at best.  No apology ... just here is your bill."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here, and I LOVE it!  The last time was at the old locations, and I like the new location a lot better.  It's bigger and has this hipster-feel to it.  This place would be a huge hit in Seattle or SF!  Whatever you order, get the hash browns.  It tastes like buttery goodness.  I don't know what they put in it, and I don't want to know.  But it tastes like angles flying around your mouth and dropping butter on your taste buds.  Yep, that good!  And cheap too!  Every plate is under $10.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Layover in Phoenix and this looked like the best option outside of burgers, Mexican and fast food chains. In B gate area.  Got the chicken pesto sandwich on wheat. Nice bread and large chicken breast that was cooked perfectly. Upgraded from chips to home fries and it was well worth it. No Coke, just Pepsi. Friendly service, too."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and great food. Will definitely go back. I had the waffle with thick cut juicy bacon and  Home potatoes. I added bell peppers to mine for extra flavor. They were a little over cooked & kinda mushy but overall a great experience during my visit to Phoenix"}
{"text":"The best way to describe Matt's is \"breakfast nirvana.\"  I've been going to this cheery downtown spot for weekend breakfasts and weekday lunches for around 2 years now and have never been disappointed with the food.  Small touches of quality abound: freshly-ground pork sausage patties, perfectly browned, homestyle potatoes o'brien (not of that cubed pre-frozen crap), thick-cut bread with homemade jam, and what tastes like real maple syrup for Matt's awesome pancakes.  What keeps a breakfast enthusiast like me from hitting Matt's at each opportunity are the insane queues, especially on weekends.  The air conditioning can also be a bit sketchy at times, too, given the cramped space and swarm of humanity in there at busy times."}
{"text":"Been here several times.  Breakfast is always fantastic and the coffee is great!  The only downside is the wait during the summer.  But even then, the food draws people (even me).  Whenever I'm up and in downtown for breakfast, this is my go-to."}
{"text":"When we walked into Matt's Big Breakfast, initially I was hesitant. There was a line out the door and I was sure we were in for a lengthy wait. We walked in to a nice open space and warm smiles from all the employees. After waiting about 5 minutes a couple of seats opened up at the bar. Chelsi greeted us as soon as we sat. All the patrons made a point to say goodbye to her as they left, and I can see why. Her excellent service and ability to make all those around her feel welcome. The food came out fairly quick. Now I know why they call it \"Matt's Big Breakfast\" there was plenty. The food was pretty good, but in addition to the atmosphere and service, this place is amazing."}
{"text":"One of the best, BLT's I've ever had. Great find in PHX airport. Friendly & fun staff. You have some time to kill, waiting for your flight, then get here."}
{"text":"Pancakes very good coffee a tad rich for my taste. Staff helpful. Atmosphere awesome with open doors on a great a day . Would come again"}
{"text":"i can never remember if i like the hash browns or home fries. it's the home fries, definitely. portions are super huge. i don't go here nearly enough, but maybe that's a good thing. breakfast is too delicious for words."}
{"text":"Great food!! Everything tastes great and was truly fresh as advertised. I got here early enough to not have to brave the long line out front (although knowing what I know now I would have happily done it). The eggs were fresh, the bacon looked and tasted like real bacon, the waffle was fluffy and delicious and the orange juice which came out of a gigantic plastic jar I'm sure was squeezed that morning. A+"}
{"text":"My server (Miguel) was super awesome, right on point with everything, quick, friendly, and attentive. I ordered a Fancy Salad. The plate arrived greasy which was weird because a salad with chicken shouldn't be greasy. The manager came out and apologized immediately. They built another fresh salad.   While it wasn't a perfect experience, the staff made up for it in friendliness and caring."}
{"text":"Sooo good!! Had the eggs Benedict and it was amazing! Came here for breakfast and it was a great environment for the group and kids. Great coffee too!"}
{"text":"Eggs were good.  The hash browns were saturated in oil. The toast wasn't.  Just warmed bread.  Coffee was ok. Nothing special. Overall?  Meh"}
{"text":"I will wait an hour in the blazing sun for this food.  Now that i have become a regular, I don't enjoy eating breakfast anywhere else.   Every time I go,  I try something different and nothing on the menu disappoints. If you go between 8 am to noon,  expect to wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"We have frequent Matt's for a while now and enjoy the downtown location. As for this location I can only give 3 stars. It can easily be 5 if the servers were more friendly. The entire time we were here  we did not see one friendly smiley face from any of the employees. No thank you or you are welcome. We had to literally wave down one of the servers to refill of coffee and water. I don't about you but when I go out for a nice meal I expect friendly service."}
{"text":"We try to come back here any time we visit Arizona. The bacon is chewy instead of crispy (really good), and the eggs just taste better. I highly recommend the fresh squeezed OJ, and the bread with homemade jam. If you happen to be in the Phoenix area, it is more than worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We have loved Matts food for a long time. We met our kids with their new baby for breakfast and found they have no baby changing station in either bathroom in their place on the lake in Tempe.   The most disturbing part...when we asked about it ....the manager was disinterested.   Wondering.... what are they thinking?"}
{"text":"Well I say they're doing a great job transformation is amazing the food is exactly the same except there's less of a wait :-)"}
{"text":"Great place!   - Perfectly cooked omelette stuffed with mushrooms, bell peppers, (whatever other veggies they offer)  - Bread was really good, and the jam o my!   -honey lemonade was top of the line. I really enjoyed that!  -The waiter, Jackson, was a really nice guy. Stayed on top of things, despite having probably 8 tables!  Only Down side:  - Jackson told us we could split checks when we pay at the front. The girl at the front said, \"we don't do that, but I'll do it for you this time\"... Which is pretty pathetic, because no one is doing me a favor by having me pay for my meal. That was the only part of my experience which was poor. Other than that, a great joint for friends or family."}
{"text":"Okay. So my sister mentioned she saw this on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. It wasn't the same spot, as they had moved from the original location to open up a larger restaurant. The back lot parking is tiny and awkward, since you'd have to back out of it to get out. But, there is plenty of street parking.   We showed up on a Saturday morning, after a walk through the nearby farmers market. The wait wasn't all that long. It was only 15 minutes for us, as we were here at about 9:30am. But, it got pretty crowded when we left.  As for all the great reviews, hrmmm... Overall, I think the food is just average. My parents got the griddlecakes, bacon and eggs. My sister got the porkchops with homefries. I ended up getting eggs, sausage, hash and toast. The parents griddlecakes were huge. They could have easily split them to share. I snagged a piece of bacon and found it quite tasty. The hasbrown was kinda overcooked, almost to the point where it was sorta burnt. Not quite, but almost. Some nice soft, white bits in my hashbrowns would have been nice. The toast was pretty chewy and took some teeth gnawing action, in order to swallow. My sister's porkchops and homefries were just okay. Though the chops look like they were seasoned with something, it wasn't all that flavorful and a bit dry.  The servers were friendly and prompt. They were quick to refill drinks. The only notable thing that stuck out was that they were sitting 3 people at what I would consider a 2 person table. A bit of a tight fit there with all the knee bumping action going on.  The place is good. It's just not great. Definitely nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of places featured on DDD - some live up to the hype, others disappoint.  Matt's did not disappoint!    My Belgian Waffle was topped with a mound of delicious sweet cream butter.  When it melted together with the pure maple syrup on my fork full of waffle, I  reached breakfast Nirvana!  The hash browns were the best I've had in recent memory.  Clearly fried in lots of butter.  The outside perfectly crisp, and the inside was soft, buttery potato perfection.  My companions had a cheese omelet and pastrami scramble  I tried them both and they too were outstanding!  The mixed berry jam was wonderful.  The Chef (owner?) stopped by our table and explained she makes it weekly from whatever berries are available.   Service was outstanding and all the workers seemed to be having a great time, which made the visit even more enjoyable.  A big tip-o-the cap to everyone at Matt's.  If I lived in Phoenix I would be a regular!"}
{"text":"We walked here from the Hyatt on 2nd Street and it was an easy stroll. We queued up and got a few coffees to lift the early morning haze from our brains. That was some super tasty java, I must say. Great start.   We ordered the Waffle (well done) and Peppered Bacon and also the Skinny eggs with the side salad and apple chicken sausage and spinach mixed in with a single pancake side.   Holy Mother of Waffle Nirvana!!! I am still dreaming of that first crunchy, tender, savory and slightly sweet Waffle. It literally blew my doors off. The bacon was perfectly salty and peppery next to the sweet syrup. Ahhhhhh ... easily an addiction.   The skinny egg dish silenced my partner for a good five minutes except for the mumbled \"Oh my gosh, this is sooooooo good\" in between forkfuls of steaming hot eggs with gooey cheese and sautéed spinach punctuated by occasional \"pancakes so amazing\" ... and a sound that was almost an unintelligible bleat for the lemon dressed arugula salad.   Seriously good breakfast, folks. Service outstanding. Prices totally reasonable. Almost every table around us had at least one order of the Sunday Special Steak and Eggs. The steaks looked nice and plump and juicy and folks really seemed to enjoy them.   MBB is located near the University and I imagine there is a line around the block to get in here when schools in session. We had to wait 20 mins on Fathers Day which wasn't bad at all. Guess that might explain all of the Steak and Egg orders."}
{"text":"Average at best.  I have been here 3 times, primarily based on all the hype and wanting to be sure that I was giving Matt's a fair shake.  Listen, it's not terrible...but it's just nothing special at all.  The menu is basic and unimaginative.  I guess I would expect some creativity in the menu selections for such a \"hot spot,\" but alas there is none.  The execution is ok, but not great.  I thought the hash browns were terrible (greasy and overdone) and the rest of it was quite ordinary, if not excessively greasy.  It's small and crowded.  The service was generally fine.  I also thought it was a bit overpriced...particularly the OJ, which I think was like $4 for a tiny glass of what seemed to be made-from-concentrate OJ.  Anyway, I think I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Oh man, I am so glad that a super friendly patron sat next me because the service was disappointing. With that being said, the food was really good.  Service: No one cleaned the area I sat at, it took a while for anyone to get me a drink, my order was wrong and I asked for an iced tea to go twice and didn't get one. Luckily, the nice fellow that sat next me ordered an iced tea to go and he gave me his.   Good: While my order was wrong, I did enjoy what I got which was the breakfast burrito without jalapeños and potatoes. Also, their salsa is bomb.com! I want to buy it."}
{"text":"So, my Ma and I just finished breakfast here and told a couple waiting to get in that never been there that it's great food and service. Thank goodness theirs was as ours pretty much was just okay. First, the coffee was lukewarm, then when she brought our breakfast my Ma's eggs were cooked scrambled hard (our waitress started to argue with my Ma saying that she had to say she wanted them scrambled soft. Which is untrue since she's had them cooked regular not soft on other visits to Matt's) and scorched and she was charged for cheese where there wasn't any, her home fries were scorched and hard, both of our toast wasn't toasted just warm bread, we both weren't offered water or given water, my Ma only got a cup and a half of coffee she would have liked another refill with her food but the waitress just looked at our table and walked away, my hash browns were somewhat raw in places, and bacon burnt when I asked for crisp. Then when paying for our bill the waitress brings us someone else credit card and says \"oh, well that's what happens when I run two at the same time.\" How do you get 2 males mixed with 2 women? A different waitress with a smile and happy attitude came and offered coffee but we were already ready to get going so she asked if we needed anything else and brought us to go boxes and a cup of ice. Very nice girls another brought back our card again with a good attitude and smile. Wish we had names to put to their faces because they deserve the acknowledgement for their customer service skills. Not such a great Birthday breakfast as planned for my Ma after all."}
{"text":"Really disappointed by this place. I heard such good things from multiple people and was completely let down. The management here is horrible and was hard to watch. For some reason they have a huge patio that is used as a waiting area instead of set up for service. We waited 45 mins to be seated for a table of 3 and multiple times during that time I witnessed tables cleared and ready to be sat to have the manager who was calling guests let the table sit empty for 10 to 15 minutes. The food and Bloody Mary I had was pretty good but not good enough to make up for the aggravation of inefficiency and having to spend 2 hours for a breakfast that would of taken an hour tops anywhere else."}
{"text":"Matt is a Kansas City native like me and like Kansas City folks knows great food.  Though breakfast is busy, it is worth the outside wait even in the middle of the summer.  The wait staff is great and always on their toes, it is fun to see the owner's wife active in the restaurant filling coffee, delivering food and following up on your experience.  Though the menu is not too long, it has all the classic greats, plus great specials.  For those who like to feel at home for breakfast, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Every-time I go here it's always a great experience. The staff is mellow and nice. The self serve water outside is always refreshing. The fresh air and downtown vibe is always great. Once you get In the service is fast and painless. Yesterday, I took my family and they enjoyed every last succulent bite of their morning special. I don't ever mind waiting, ever. This place is just that good."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness do I love this place! Truly an inspired breakfast/lunch spot in Phoenix. I had the bacon and fried eggs with country potatoes. Delicious especially with the fresh rosemary on the potatoes. A really nice locally roasted coffee, plus fresh squeezed orange juice. Yummmm. I loved it so much I went back the next day! It's pretty crowded on the weekend but I was seated after only a short wait. Whatever the daily breakfast special is, get it! I had a ham, aged cheddar, spinach scramble on my second visit and it was fabulous. I really really love this place and encourage you to go when in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Our experience was disappointing from the very beginning. After waiting for over 30 minutes, which we were fine with, they proceeded to seat another couple who signed in after us. I brought it to the hosts attention, no big deal, they got us another table. We sat down, and the host rudely came back over to us and told us to sign in next time, which we had done, they just skipped over us. Them missing us wasn't a big deal, his attitude when he approached us was a huge turnoff. Whatever. We were ready for this awesome breakfast after reading all of the reviews. I got a waffle and bacon. The waffle tasted the same as any other regular waffle on planet earth, the bacon was good. That together was $7.95, at least throw an egg or two in there! They also give you 2oz of syrup, which was enough for my one waffle but not enough for my husband's 3 pancakes (no one likes choking on a pancake). It was $1.50 for an additional 2oz of syrup, which I find absolutely ridiculous. Again, the pancakes tasted just like any regular pancakes. My husband sat with no refill of his water for over ten minutes before I had to get up and ask for it to be refilled.   Overall, we were unimpressed with the service and food.   We did eat breakfast at Vovomeenas on our visit and it was phenomenal from start to finish and reasonably prices. I would take their breakfast ten times over Matt's big breakfast, no questions asked (get the BMOC!)"}
{"text":"Service is sub-par, they're still getting the hang of things. Small restaurant but nice atmosphere in the new Marina Heights! Menu is very limited. Ordered the Saturday Special Scramble. 3 eggs, apple sausage, jalapeños, cheese with choice of toast. Scramble was soggy and hash browns were over peppered. Was going to order a Bloody Mary but they're $12 each. Overall, not my favorite breakfast place in Tempe."}
{"text":"I visited a friend in Phoenix. She knew I was a breakfast buff so she took me to Matt's Big Breakfast since it was so well known around the city and the country. I enjoyed my meal but \"big breakfast\" was a bit misleading.  For starters, I thought the breakfast menu was particularly small and the options on the menu were strange. There was a breakfast sandwich, cheese omelet, pork chop and eggs, pancakes, salami scramble, waffle, oatmeal and frosted flakes. Yes, you could order frosted flakes for $4.50. Why? I don't know. Nothing really appealed to me on the menu which was strange.  I chose eggs over easy, bacon and hashbrows with toast. The bacon was phenomenal. This may have been the best bacon I've ever had. The hash browns were thinly shredded and very crispy but not burned in the slightest. The toast was thick and chewy with homemade jam. Everything I ate was excellent.  The service was atrocious. I ordered a coffee. I got one cup which was luke warm. I asked for a refill but that refill never came. I asked for water and that didn't arrive until the end of the meal. No one checked on us after we got our food.   I heard they moved to a new place which is nice, industrial and modern inside (think Chipotle) but it's small. The lay out is also stupid and there is a lot of wasted space.   Even at 9am there was a 1/2 hour wait to eat. I don't know if it's worth it. The food is excellent and well prepared but the rest is a bit of a mess. The menu may be small but it's all done well. I don't think I'd wait very long to eat here again. I've had better breakfast in Phoenix and I'd go there instead."}
{"text":"This place is now one of my favs. You can tell it is a staple for Phoenix. Definitely a place you take your friends who are visiting from out of town. I had the five spot, which is a breakfast sandwich is better than you think it would be. Great and fresh two eggs with bacon and cheese! Yummy! I also got some homefries which are seasoned with rosemary and olive oil. Those are good as well. My girlfriend got the Reuben which she said was one of the best she had. The mustard has a horseradish flavor which I'm not too fond of but it went well with the sandwich. My other friend that was with us had the egg salad and she said it was bomb! I also had the blueberry honey lemonade which was great. It was a little pulpy but not too sweet and not too tart. My girlfriend had the strawberry lemonade which was less pulpy and a little more tart. Both were great. Overall a great experience and we will be back again!"}
{"text":"My home girl has been to the Phoenix location and she said it started as a hole in the wall breakfast joint that was so good. She's been wanting to check out the Tempe location and I've never been to this place, so I was all for it. We couldn't decide if we wanted home fries or hashbrowns, so we got both. Why not?! The hasbrowns were crispy and greasy, just the way they're suppose to be. They were sooooo good. And then, the home fries had rosemary seasoning in it and it was fantastic. I love both of the sides. Also, the waffle was AMAZING. I would come back. The food here is amazing."}
{"text":"Working at a large hotel downtown I am always sending people to Mat's Big Breakfast and I finally had the opportunity to hear what all the talk was about this morning when a friend and I decided to eat there. As usual there was a wait, but there was some seating outside for us. I have to say I really liked the desert landscaping out front. I ordered the special which was an omelet with fresh jalapenos, cheese, with hash browns. I also ordered a side of the bacon which was delicious! Actually it was all delicious. All of the servers were extremely friendly and said goodbye and thank you to every patron that was leaving. The orange juice is also a must to try. It was like they picked an orange right off a tree. I can't wait to give my money to this place because it's local, the food is fresh, and it's just great."}
{"text":"First come, first serve so put your name down quick on that notepad... Super friendly staff with super friendly comfort food.    Don't go with a big party! The three of us ordered grass fed steak and eggs, the pork chop and egg, the bacon and home fries... all were delicious!  The wheat bread came with their home made strawberry preserves.    Great for an american breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"I wish that i just ate at the place all of these good reviews were for. The bloody Mary had no flavor, salt pepper and hot sauce made it ok. The big garnish polished it up a bit, worth $10 airport price at best, not $14.  I had an omelet with mushrooms. The plate was covered in the grease from the omelet, which was overcooked and chewy .The potatoes were both burnt and cold.   The bartenders treated the patrons like a nuisance. Zero chance of getting a coffee refill. The place was packed when I sat down and emptied out by the time I got my meal. I sat with and empty coffee cup and bloody glass for 15 min until I threw down my card.   I'll skip a meal before I come back."}
{"text":"The best breakfast spot ever!! It reminds me of hash house a go go. Fresh farm to table food! Service was impeccable too! It's a must try! Found this listing on DDD from food network. So glad we came here. Try their specialty drinks as well!"}
{"text":"What a surprise to stumble upon this restaurant. My connecting flight changed gates two times, ending at gate 10....and net door is this fine establishment. My mind thinks breakfast at any time of the day or evening is a perfect choice so why not at least give this place a quick once over...  Interesting menu...the pork chop catches my eye so hey, why not, lets give this a go. It came out to the table in 5-minutes...steaming hot, with my eggs scrambled lightly as I asked, breakfast potatoes....I would have preferred hash browns, but these were good...toast, and one huge pork chop...awesome.  My eggs were perfect, and the potatoes were perfect as well, and the toast...I ordered rye, but didn't expect to get TEXAS rye toast...LOL, these were huge slices...buttery and quite tasty....and that pork chop...it was amazing, thick cut, minimal fat around the edges...bone in, and so moist and tasty.  What a real surprise finding this place...good service, excellent food, and the price...$9 I think....incredible.  Definitely earned a 4-star, perhaps a 5-star after a few more visits...in any event, a good experience all the way around. And speedy...in an airport waiting for your flight or making a connection, you don't have much time to sit around waiting for a server, food or a check when your meal is all done...this place was conscious of that requirement and did a great job. I will be back...I hope to see you there...!!!"}
{"text":"Coming from a diner-centric middle america, I was a little underwhelmed at the limited menu at Matt's, but boy, what he does cook he does excellently. The scrambled eggs I had in my special were easy enough, and I liked the combination of the local shishito peppers, ham, and jack cheese, but the hashbrowns are a shining example of how to execute them perfectly. I wish I had the bacon, too, because that also looked outstanding. Like many of the best places in Phoenix the line grows exponentially by the hour, so get there early and prepare to wait. It's interesting to see the large amount of abandoned restaurant concepts in the surrounding area, but I don't expect Matt's will be among them anytime soon."}
{"text":"Love this spot - it's pretty close to the convention center so Natalie and I went here to check it out. The bacon is awesome here!  Their philosophy is great too - local, organic, etc. etc.  The place is tiny and quaint too and as always it's great to support a local independent business.    Best breakfast in Phoenix that i've had and definitely one of my fave spots - went there the next day too - got the special and it was delish - check my photos to see what we got!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in my whole experience here. I was really looking forward to trying this place and been waiting for a few months to go. My boyfriend was visiting and we thought Sunday brunch there would be great.  We arrived at 830AM and they said a 20-30 minute wait. No big deal, we can do that.  The crowd was moving quickly and the host was efficient at seating people quickly. He came or and said we were next. With the way the crowd was mocking before, we thought we would get seated soon but nope. We wait another 10-15 mins, which didn't make any sense.  We sat down and figured out what we wanted to order. A girl came over a while after we seated to drop off water. She asked if anyone had taken our drink orders and we said no and that we were actually ready to order food.  Waitress was unfriendly and didn't even tell us he specials.   The food was good, don't get me wrong but it's definitely overrated. I travel a lot and love to try restaurants in different cities, this isn't even worth a second visit. Potatoes were way too over flavored with rosemary, it was overpowering.   The omelette is just jut eggs with your toppings folded inside not mixed in and cooked with the eggs. It was eggs with a few things inside, nothing special. Even hotel omelette stations mix the eggs and toppings.  We had to flag our waitress down to give us more water.  When we went to pay, the cashier was very short with me. He was chatting up the person in front of me but was very quiet with me. Half way through the transaction he asked \"how was everything\". It seemed very forced! I said \"things were okay\" and he didn't respond.   Honestly, the food was a good but not worth the terrible service. Small menu and gross bathrooms.  Maybe if the staff was a little nicer I would return to try something else on the menu.  Will not try again."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast is located in a little building on the corner of 1st Street and Garfield. It is always packed and if you don't arrive before roughly 9AM you will wait for a table. Luckily we were able to get the last table on a recent Saturday. It is at this moment that our luck ran out.  I have said this before: there are only a handful of breakfast spots in downtown Phoenix so to hear people tell it, this is the greatest breakfast place in the world. However, this analysis is false, the breakfast is average at best and is elevated in lieu of other options.   There is parking located behind the building and all along the streets. At various times a song would come on the speakers inside and drown out the chatter, and then silence for 10 minutes. Maybe we came on an off day.  Perhaps someone can help me with something, I ordered the hash browns and they tasted as if they were smothered in vanilla or something sweet. This was immediately off-putting and I could not tell if this was intended but it ruined the whole experience. I did like the jam they served with the sourdough toast, it was probably the best part of the meal.  Ordinarily I would ask a server about this strange flavor choice for the hash browns but it was so incredibly busy that waiting 10 minutes for a water refill seemed to signal to me that I should just move on with my day.  I tried the salami scramble and there massive chunks of sopressata haphazardly tossed in a mountain of eggs. It came with potatoes on the side, they were tasteless and I couldn't finish them.   I may return to try their lunch menu at some point but I will not eat breakfast here again unless forced to."}
{"text":"Anyone who gives less than 5 stars clearly hasn't tried their pancakes. This place is amazing, and will always be my favorite breakfast in town!"}
{"text":"A total fave of mine! Service was a bit slow but the food was worth any and all wait! Thick peppered bacon, sourdough toast with homemade preserves & butter cant be beat!"}
{"text":"I might not be the Duke at Matt's big breakfast but I'm always given the special treatment! Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Ive always wanted to try Matt's BB at the airport..... Even though this is the only Matts that serves alcohol, it  doesn't compare. Stay with the original location, even the food portion was different."}
{"text":"Wow, so the bacon was amazing, there's the 1 star... but if you order an alcoholic drink don't order the liquor. Well liquor (base model) is over $12 dollars a shot. These are more than the highest Priced clubs in Scottsdale. So if you're catching a flight and think, oh a screwdriver would be nice... think again, or go elsewhere. The prices are outrageous and the staff was crazy defensive about me questioning the price. Yo, this isn't the Encore in Vegas."}
{"text":"Breakfast is always consistent but customer service isn't. It suck that the service is not consistent. I come here like 3-4 times a week . Well looks like I'm going to have to find a different spot ."}
{"text":"Ok. I started coming here when Matt could only get the local downtown area news channel to cover his place. It was only open for about 2 weeks and you could walk in at the height of the lunch hour and grab a table or spot at the bar. That was then and the food \"F\" rocked! Ok flashed forward to present day! Service is still pretty good, the wait can be a bit long, the food now is just ok. It has lost it's charm a little. Menu is sit short. If you are in the area and can afford to kill 30 minutes for a spot then check it out."}
{"text":"Love live love the omelette with ham, American cheese and onion.  Also their homemade jam is awesome.  The only draw back is it is a bit loud."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast that was well prepared.  The Bloody Mary is an excellent choice. It comes with a salad bar in it! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a bite-- not your normal airport grub. Breakfast is Served all day.   I had the \"smothered and covered\"-- chuck steak with mushroom, onions, and mushroom gravy.  very good. The mashed potatoes were better than most steakhouses.   Good TVs around the bar-- an odd music playlist. Drink selection ok. Employees were high energy and pleasant and accommodating.   Typical airport pricing was the only negative."}
{"text":"I love this place. We've been going every Saturday for the past few months, and although there is always at least an hour wait on Saturdays the awesome food and cute cozy atmosphere has been worth it. This is definitely a gem in the heart of downtown Phoenix, I personally love the Hog and Chick which is two eggs cooked to order, three big strips of peppered bacon, your choice of hash browns or home fries and your choice of fresh baked toasted bread on the side served up with preserves from a local source. Their honey lemonade is inspired and their iced coffee is pretty good too.   They are right across the street from the Phoenix Public Market and if you want to go walk around and see the shops instead of waiting outside (for an hour) you can write 'market' by your name and you will be seated next up if you get back after you've been called. My daughter always orders the waffles and devours them and her dad keeps 'waffling' between the pancakes and the waffles but always cleans his plate (and usually some of mine as well!) the hostess is very cheery and efficient, she calls us 'Team Justin' and she always checks in with us at least once or twice during our meal.  I'd definitely check this place out if you've never been, they used to be closed on Monday's but very recently that's changed and I've been told that if you want to get in WITHOUT the wait, Monday is the time to go! Happy Eating from Team Justin!"}
{"text":"Whoa! I have never had such a good breakfast! This place is really good!! I got the The Five Spot which is a breakfast sandwich and I added a side of hash brown.  And wow, the hash brown is so good. It so creamy and crispy!!! The sandwich itself was ok. I liked the sandwich but I felt like I could make it at home. Although the bread is pretty good.  I tried the bacon and it's so crispy!!!   Overall, this place is really good. Got seated right away and the manager here he is so nice. Good service, good food, and good vibes. Will definitely come back soon"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a long time, and there's been no dip.  Kudos to Matt and Erenia for holding true to the idea of making rad, no-frills breakfast food like they do back on the farm.  I don't eat here as often as I'd like, because the lines are impossible and I don't have the time to devote to an hour wait for Saturday or Sunday breakfast, but if the night before was long and I end up sleeping in, I have no shame about grabbing some breakfast at 1:30, and the lines are usually gone by then.  I will miss this place dearly."}
{"text":"Tuesday morning no wait!! Food was stellar, small menu, simple and good, price was a little rough thirty five bones for two... But worth it for triple D,spot."}
{"text":"Save your money! This place is way to over-rated! Stopped in for breakfast and as usual it is so loud, you can't carry a conversation with your friends. The chairs are hard and uncomfortable, the table is unsteady... wiggles back and forth, which is annoying. I ordered the \"Special\".... isn't the special supposed to be lower price?? Well it wasn't. Paid 10.00 for 2 pieces of French toast with one hot dog type sausage..... it was ok, not worth the money...I could get a bigger, better breakfast for a lot less at Denny's. Now the real reason I'm writing....I had 1 cup of coffee because the waitress refused to even ASK me if I wanted another cup, which I did.... she stared right at my empty cup, gathered our dirty dishes, gave us our check like \"Hurry up and get out of here!\" and walked off. She came to our table 3 times and never asked.  I decided, I will never be back... Check came to 26.00 for 2 breakfasts, 1 coffee.... They were very crowded, so she just wanted us out... terrible service... skip this place. There are better places to eat... more comfortable, less noisy and the waitresses will treat you right!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised how busy this place was for a Monday morning. We checked in for a table of two, five ten minutes later we had a table. I really enjoyed the environment but I really really didn't like the fact that I had to order 2 times because every time I would ask for something it was only for Thursday's or Wednesday, apparently the restaurant has two different menus which didn't know so that was frustrating but after the 3rd time we ordered. Our food came in fast and the waitress was kept checking back with us and making sure our drinks where full at all times. When I'm back to visit I'll make sure to come here again."}
{"text":"Excellent, speedy service. Restaurant was packed at 8am on a Sunday morning. Food was awesome!"}
{"text":"Plenty of parking. They were busy but would not seat us till everyone  showed up . There was a 30 minutes  wait . The portions were large . I ordered bacon to small stack. The pan cakes  were a little  sweet so I did not use any syrup  just a little  bitter . Bacon was a little  overcooked  and  on the small size.. it was good experience  . Good service"}
{"text":"Always a solid breakfast. They don't have a big menue but what the make they make well.  I really wish they had biscuits and gravy but the toast and homemade jam almost make up for it.  The bloody Mary is great! The Gin Rickey was light and refreshing but they forgot to add a lime wedge.  Thats just being picky though.  It's a great breakfast place. Period."}
{"text":"This place is a an amazing addition to an airport. The food is absolutely delicious. If there is a wait it is worth it!"}
{"text":"On our trip to AZ we had to stop by here. We wanted to dine in, but on our way to the airport it only made sense to bring the food back to the place we were staying at since we had yet to pack. This place brings the traditional simplicity of breakfast back to the kitchen table.  We opted for the \"Hog & Chick\" and Griddlecakes. Both were delicious and very filling. Simple breakfast made with that home made touch. We were glad we stopped by here before we headed back home. On top of the food, the service was amazing and friendly, and the bill was not a big dent in the wallet either. Overall an amazing experience with Matt's. We will definitely be back for our next trip."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast wasn't bad but also wasn't great. The breakfast menu didn't have many options. I ended up getting the five spot breakfast sandwich and my girlfriend got a omelet with veggies since there weren't any vegan options. Overall the food was good, simple, and inexpensive. It is more of a casual atmosphere so expect it to be a bit loud and quite busy at times. If you're looking for a simple and inexpensive breakfast this might be your spot."}
{"text":"I really don't understand what people are ordering that they say that the serving sizes here are small. My meal came with a pork chop, 2 eggs, and hash browns, which I could barely keep all on my plate (it was so much food) and a side of thick sourdough toast (2 slices). Mike ordered the fives pot which was just a sandwich. Considering we had waited almost an hour for breakfast we also ordered a side of bacon (so yummy!) and one pancake so we could try a few other things. The people sitting next to me at the counter ordered the special omelet which also took up the whole plate.   This place is so tiny. There were three tables in the main eating area (which could seat 2-3 each), 6 seats at the counter, 3 more seats in the side room at a counter and two spaces where they could seat parties of about 4-5.   Although it took quite some time just to get in (and you have to wait outside to be called, keep this in mind if  you are there on a cold day) it doesn't take very long to get your food. It took 10-15 minutes to get our food. By the time we finished they had already turned over all of the tables.   The staff was very friendly and the food was good. My pork chop was juicy and I loved the hash browns and bacon. Mike's five spot wasn't as tasty. The eggs were overcooked and a bit dry. He wished he would have had the pancakes instead.   They have some good eats."}
{"text":"Jen was a great server. Very attentive and friendly. The big butter burger hit the spot."}
{"text":"Matt's was awesome. Both the food and service was perfect. I'll definitely be back On my next trip to Phoenix. You'll be very happy you chose Matt's Big breakfast."}
{"text":"Matt's is awesome for breakfast. Go hungry because the portions are large. I really like the ham steak and eggs. There fresh jam is also amazing. The breakfast sandwich is fantastic."}
{"text":"So lets start with the bad. I asked for my eggs to be over medium and the came over medium/hard. Ok, now that that's out of the way......WOW!!! The food was amazing. I got \"The Chop & Chick\". The pork rib chop was cooked perfectly. Great seasoning blend, I did add salt, but then I add salt to everything. The homefries were delicious. And the eggs, even though they weren't as runny as I like, were good as well. I also had white toast which you could tell was made from scratch and came with a blueberry preserve, which was also delicious. 5 Star restaurant. I will definitely be talking about Matt's Big Breakfast to all my friends. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"The BEST breakfast in town !!!!! Friendly staff ! I love the griddle cakes !!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best bacon hands down also I don't drink coffee and for some reason I found myself drinking 4 cups of it and the weird part was I didn't put cream or sugar it tastes so good"}
{"text":"Happy with my experience.   Came here recently for breakfast with my girlfriend. We arrived and were informed the wait would be 45 mins to an hour. Luckily we only waited for around 30 minutes.   We ordered the daily special which was steak and eggs...also got some eggs, toast, and hash browns. Unfortunately, we ended up waiting nearly 40 mins for our food which was a tad bit disappointing because I heard good things about this place and service.   Food eventually came out and was delicious... What amended the situation for me was managements handling of the everything. Without us even complaining they paid for our meal and apologized for the wait.   Shout out to management for the professionalism. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food (not just breakfast).  Everything is better than you think is possible.  Matt and Erenia are genuinely nice people who deserve all of the success that they've achieved.  Even when extremely busy, the staff does everything possible to make the guests feel comfortable and to be accommodating.  I do try to avoid the crowded times."}
{"text":"Matt's is a cute little breakfast place in downtown phoenix.    They are always busy and the staff is really nice and sweet.   I always seem to get the special every time I go there.   The one thing I really like about Matt's is that the food is always fresh.     There is sometimes a wait on a Saturday morning.  But normally the wait is about 15 to 20 minutes long.  The only thing I wish they had on the weekend is french toast and that the coffee was a lot stronger.  It normally takes like water down coffee."}
{"text":"Matts big breakfast is awesome. This is my third time here. Each time I visit I order the special. Today's special was 3 scrambled eggs with meat, home fries and a tortilla. Awesome. The portions are Drake and thick and enough to keep your for the entire day. I wish there was a location in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Matt's for the last 3 years. I go there at least once a week to meet with my circle of friends. Ernie the owner has become a great friend and is an awesome example of someone who has connected with the culture of urban Phoenix. The only drawback which is also Matt's strength is that it is a small place good for only groups of 4 or so. I have had Matt's all to myself with bigger groups of 20 but it requires planning ahead. I suggest going with either the Hog and Chick or try the waffles."}
{"text":"I was afraid this place would be overrated, because most breakfast places are. I usually think, how hard is it to cook up some eggs? and most places can't cook pancakes and waffles better than my mom. I was very wrong, this place was so, so, sooooo good. I had the salami egg scramble with hash browns, everything was cooked perfectly. The toast that came with fresh preserves and butter was amazing! My husband had the waffle with REAL maple syrup (a requirement in my mind) and sorry mom, but this one was actually better than yours. With the waffle came a side of the thickest, most flavorful bacon I've ever had. I would come back here for the bacon alone! This place is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's worth the wait just for the orange juice - but the food is good too.  The boys went camping, so my daughter and I woke up early and headed downtown for the farmer's market and some breakfast. We stopped at Matt's long enough to put our name on the list and then ventured across the street to meander through all the local wares. We took our time and when we came back, we met and visited a couple of moms who had brought their daughters all the way from Calgary to try this place. (wow)  Here's what we figured out about the wait: it's about 30-40 minutes per page of names ahead of you... (ish) Two pages of names ahead of us when we signed in = 1 hour 10 minutes total wait on the day we went.  Once inside, I loved the quaintness of the place ( and our service was superb. It's also obvious that they recognize people who have been in before and sometimes even know their names.  Being somewhat indecisive, we ordered the cheese omelet and the belgian waffle and shared. The omelet had just the right amount of cheese, making it a perfect accompaniment to the oh-my-gosh! fabulous wheat toast with locally made strawberry preserves. The hashbrowns were nothing to get excited about, but in the nirvana of the previously mentioned last bite, who cares?!?  But wait. Then I tried the waffle.  One of my best friends and I make waffles all the time - and have been making them for years. She's know for hers. I'm really sorry, dear friend, but Matt's has you beat. Their belgian is the ultimate experience of amazingness with just the right combination of being fluffy without being soggy. Add the 100% maple syrup and I'm good... so very very good. There's no need for the sweet cream butter - but it's there if you want it.  If they could pick the perfect orange at the moment of ultimate ripeness and squeeze it into a glass, you might be able to imagine the essence of every sip of the juice we drank. Just for kicks, we ordered the honey lemonade. Not really a breakfast beverage, but a must have for when we go back for lunch.  Go knowing that you will wait and that it will be worth every minute. Definitely looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Gets packed on weekends so I try to make it a weekday treat!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast places I've tried in the Valley. The freshness and quality of their ingredients are manifested in the very good food they serve. Service is friendly and quite fast, considering that our group came at a time when the eatery was very crowded, which seems to be typical of the establishment. The popularity of the place had its downsides, of course - long waits outside and parking can be tricky in this part of downtown."}
{"text":"Yum!   Loved the atmosphere and menu!   Was even busy on a Friday mid morning!! I can just imagine how packed the place can be on weekends. Good service, and easy parking.   Got the breakfast special-scrambled eggs with spinach and sausage. Hash browns were a little different, Kinda mushy. I will be trying the country potatoes next time. Friend had the salami scramble. Also delish! And good size portions! We had left overs to take home.    Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"It's tempting to suggest, \"an egg is just an egg\". You hear that kind of thing a lot, and admittedly, there have been plenty of \"legendary\" breakfast places that have made me feel just that. Matt's Big Breakfast is not one of them.  What makes MBB unique is the quality of the food and the quality of the ingredients they use to make it. True, there menu is small, and when you read it, nothing particular will jump out at you , but that doesn't mean there's nothing special on it. For instace, everybody serves hashbrowns but these are without a doubt THE BEST hashbrowns I have ever had. The omlettes and eggs are great too.   No doubt, Matt's serves five-star food. It only loses a star because it's a little pricey and the wait is usually waaay too long. Maybe I shouldn't hold that against them, but I do...so get over it.   Also, their lunch is just average, and of course, they close far too early."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast I've ever had.  Period.  The food was SO good that it totally outweighed the wait outside on a hot day.  Yes, you WILL wait if you come here, but it is absolutely worth it.  The staff here are quite adept at quickly moving people through the restaurant without making anyone feel terribly rushed, and other than your wait to get seated, you won't wait long on anything else.  Most breakfast places excel at one or two things, usually the sweeter side of breakfast (pancakes, waffles, etc).  I don't tend to eat a lot of these, so I'm stuck getting some half-toasted toast, eggs, and potatoes.  Not here.  Here everything on their menu looks good and is even better in execution.  I did end up ordering the toast, eggs, and potatoes, to be fair, but I still can't forget just how good they were.  The toast was a whole-grain variety, thickly sliced, nutty, and perfectly toasted.  It was served with butter and jam, and it was so good that I was reluctant to let my friend try any of it.  The potatoes were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, but both the toast and the potatoes paled in comparison to the eggs.  Yes.  Eggs.  Matt's Big Breakfast earns my nod as the best breakfast joint I've ever patronized because of their eggs.  They were scrambled, but something about them was so mouthwatering that I was disappointed when I finished them.   Most scrambled eggs at other restaurants are served cold, dry, chewy, or any number of other unappetizing ways.  Not at Matt's.  I'm sure they cooked them in butter or something equally as awful for you but, damn, were they ever good.  To this day, nearly a year later, I still have not had better eggs anywhere else.  Believe me, I've tried.  Nothing beats Matt's.  Everything else looked amazing, and they frequently feature specials.  This is the Pizzeria Bianco of breakfast in Phoenix.  Long waits, but a must-attend for each and every Phoenician."}
{"text":"I really don't see what the big deal is about this place. It was packed on a Sunday morning, yet the food was just standard stuff. I've had better breakfasts at IHOP. My pancakes were extremely dry, and the real maple syrup was too expensive to get more of it. The coffee was fine. The hash browns were good and it's interesting that they served a pork chip. But it was tough, and the eggs were undercooked. We liked our lemonades though. And it's great that they use local suppliers.   Unfortunately our waitress was very unfriendly. She didn't smile once, and seemed like she'd rather be anywhere else. I get that you're busy, but a little interest would have gone a long way.   Bring from the Midwest, I know what a good breakfast place is like. This ain't it."}
{"text":"The food was not good and special.  The service was bad, we never received refills on our waters.  The cashier was irritated with us when they over charged is by $10.  The cashier was arguing with is on how their calculations was right until i pointed it out to her.  I was very disappointed in this restaurant because i have heard good things about the place."}
{"text":"Bomb.com anyone who doesn't give this place five stars is insane! Service is great and the food never disappoints."}
{"text":"Pretty solid cafe in the middle of the PHX airport.  one of the few places they will seat you and bring a menu vs. cafeteria style. decent lunch and bar too."}
{"text":"Very bad experience, and we didn't even get to taste their food. When we arrived we were told that the wait would be 45min to 1hour so we put our name down and waited. After seeing two couples who arrived after us able to sit down to eat, we asked what was going on. The guy simply said \"sorry I skipped you\".So we left and will never go back"}
{"text":"This food tasted as bad as it looks! The potatoes were gray/green in color, and tasted awful! How in the world do you screw up a fried potato???? The food was just as dark as it appears in the photo. Really bad food for $16.00. Go some place else!"}
{"text":"So Matt's Big Breakfast's manager or employee named Jason is one rude jerk. We brought friends with us to have breakfast today and there was a line by the door when Jason yelled at us in the most aggressive manner, \"Can you not block my door?!\". He was so demeaning to us the whole restaurant almost heard. With no apology, my friends and I felt we were targeted and not welcomed because we are all minorities. I cannot believe how rude he was to us and then when my fiancé tried to talk to him regarding that, he denied and said he asked us nicely which was a lie. We left and more people came in and blocked the door. My friend called him out on it as to why it was okay for them to be by it and all Jason did was smile and walk away.Then he got really mad and called security on us to get us \"off his property\". The property managers in the area came and actually spoke to us and understood the gravity of the situation more than that jerk did. I really hope you get in trouble Jason. That is not the way to speak to anyone at all!"}
{"text":"I have lived within 200 meters of this fine establishment for two months and I finally ventured there today.  Why did I wait so long?  I have to admit, I was unimpressed with the petite breakfast menu.  I am used to pages of breakfast options.  1 page for eggs, 1 page for scrabbles etc.  Well Matt's has 1 page (period).  What they lack in options they more than make up in quality.  They are not a jack of all breakfast trades, they are masters of a few.    I started my first foray with a simple two eggs, sausage, hash browns and toast.  Potatoes were actually browned to a wonderful golden brown.  The cinnamon raisin, walnut toast was thick and great.  the home made country sausage links were a nice blend of spice and subtle sweetness.  Ok, my eggs were a bit runny they were more over easy than the over medium that I wanted, also a bit cold.  But I survived.  I sat at the counter and the young lady that served me there was wonderful.  She really added value as a friendly attentive server.  I tried to see if she had a name tag so I could specifically mention her, but I never saw one.  I will return with friends and family soon.  Side note- I was a bit disappointed to find they do not open until 6:30am.  I got there at 6:00am.  I can also tell you that on a Saturday morning, they were already full and had people queuing up for tables by 6:55 AM."}
{"text":"This is the type of restaurant you only go to once. I have now been there twice - once at the old location, once at the new one. The reason you only go there once?  HOLY WAIT TIME, batman.  I'm sorry, but there has to be a way to make the seating more efficient.  When you're hungry, there's nothing worse than 30-60 minute wait times, or a giant party of 15 people who arrive later than you do and they get to \"squeeze in\". Although Matt's has just upgraded to a new, bigger space, this still isn't the type of restaurant that should be accommodating 15-person groups (AKA almost the entire dining area).  We went here for my husband's birthday on a Friday morning. After waiting about 45 minutes, we were next on the list but got bumped to the uncomfortable street-facing counter seats, when at that very moment there were three empty two-top tables, completely set with silverware and everything. We asked if we could be seated there instead, but were turned down by the host, because they were being reserved for the aforementioned party. My husband was having trouble with knee pain that morning and the counter seats did not physically accommodate his needs, so we asked our waitress if there was anywhere else we could sit. Again, we were turned down. I was getting a little flustered, not the way you want to feel on your loved one's birthday. We considered leaving, even after we ordered our food. Eventually, they did allow us to sit at a two-top, which I appreciated.  The food was the only redeeming quality, but again I was too flustered to truly enjoy it. I got the cheese omelette with hash browns. Very good, although hash browns were a greasy, mushy mess. My husband got a ham scramble of some kind. We had a side of rye toast, which was tasty. Beverages were served in cute little jam jars.  PROS: Food, Decor, Charm, Ambience, Supporting a local endeavor  CONS: The most hyper-inflated wait time and some of the worst seating options of any restaurant I've ever known.  The take-out option sounds nice, and would eliminate a lot of my frustrations."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast!  I came in on a Monday morning around 11 and believe it or not, only waited 5 mins. for a seat!  Sat at the bar and was able to order right away. I had coffee and The Hog & Chick plate which comes with Thick cut bacon (or sausage if you'd rather).   The thick bacon was incredible and so tasty and totally lived up to the hype that this place generates.  Tasty coffee as well and the staff is super friendly but fast and efficient.  Overall awesome food and experience!"}
{"text":"Other than the wait it was really good. I got the pork chop and it was okay but i wouldnt order it again. Everything else is made really well and with great ingredients. Its simple but delicious."}
{"text":"Assholes! Don't eat here. They forgot to write our name on the waiting list and then where jerks about it as if it was my fault Had the nerve to roll his guys and everything. Ruined my morning. So irritated."}
{"text":"Been coming to Matt's Big Breakfast for over 6 years now. We actually got to see Faizon Love there. Really a nice kick back place for breakfast. My daughter likes the Belgium Waffle most."}
{"text":"Food is good but staff tends to be cold and distant.  Get the fresh squeezed OJ. It's really good!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 3-4 times and for whatever reason the staff seems annoyed that they are here, distracted and almost rude.   I've eaten breakfast at Matts downtown PHX and the experience and frankly quality of food is much better.   Ordered Matts Big Breakfast: bacon was cold, sausage was undercooked and the eggs I ordered over medium were also under cooked.   Whole experience was disappointing."}
{"text":"Nowhere near living up to it's hype. I have been hearing people sing the praises of this  place for a while now and my girl and I decided to give it a shot since it's so close to home. I have also heard horror stories of horrendous wait times so we aimed for after breakfast but before lunch. It was indeed packed but we were seated fairly quickly. The place really aint much for the eyes. No real decor and kinda rough looking. Right away we noticed how sparse the menu is. Really not much to choose from. Especially if it is before lunch time.   I ordered the Chop and Chick while my girl had the Hog and Chick. Well... where do I start? First thing, my glass of Iced Tea was filthy! 2 different colors of debris no less. I quickly dismissed it so as to not alert my girl who can be quite sensitive about things of that nature. Her glass was fine. The food comes after a wait that was starting to feel too long. It really seemed as if the cooks ONLY paid attention to the meat and couldn't care less about the rest. My eggs were slimy, my home fries were over cooked to the point you couldn't hardly chew the parts that weren't mush. My girl's hashbrowns were a big greasy mess that she said had no flavor what so ever. My chop was actually pretty damn good as was her bacon. But that was not nearly enough to save a breakfast that was NOT worth the $30.00 bill. Too much worrying about hepster, hippy,  vegan, yada yada not enough focus on good cooking. All the cracked sea salt (which won't come out of the holes in the shaker mind you) and raw sugar (which I freaking hate!) in the world doesn't make up for a lack of attention to detail.  Think twice folks. Don't believe the hype. We won't be going back. Certainly not when Mel's Diner is so close!!!"}
{"text":"Love Matt's big breakfast!!! Whenever I go through Phoenix, I make it a point to stop by Matt's   Real ingredients makes for real Food!  I can eat at Matt's and be full for the rest of the day, and be satisfied!  Great waffles! Great pancakes! Great eggs! Great thick pieces of bacon, and not mention their brunch menu.  To bad I live 200 miles away, I'd be a regular! :)"}
{"text":"After all the hype, and an hour wait, I was not really impressed with the menu. I got a cheese omelet which was fine, but not crazy good. The side of toast was the best part-served with homemade jam-I would have been happier with just an order of that and coffee. Went here for the surrounding area which is known for art murals in this part of the city, so overall, was worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome joint for Breakfast. Been trying to get for years and finally made it. If you like breakfast food this is the place with everything is made from scratch. Had the biscuits and gravy with egg and hash browns.  Reasonable prices, and large portions. Lots of parking available. A must stop when your in Phoenix. BTW this is a Triple D joint"}
{"text":"I was specifically looking for a good breakfast place in Phoenix. The concierge suggested Matt's Big Breakfast. I looked at some yelp reviews and figured I'd give it a try. I took the light rail over from my hotel and got off too soon and ended up doing a bit of walking in 100 degree weather. The place was small, had air conditioning, and I was hoping I wouldn't have to wait, even though the reviews said otherwise. I was by myself and able to sit at the counter right away! I ordered the belgian waffle, which had sweet cream butter, sprinkled with powdered sugar and maple syrup on the side. It was served with a side of thick cut bacon, which I have never tasted like this before - it was peppered and tasted really good! I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs. Let me tell you, the food was good - I ate my entire breakfast! The staff was very friendly too. As I was paying and getting ready to leave, I noticed a stamp of Guy Fieri's face on the wall! This place had been featured on the Food Network and I had no idea - usually I look up where he goes or places featured on Man vs. Food. I'd say stop in and check it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Went back to Matt's to try another breakfast entree today.  I ordered their omelette with Wisconsin cheddar cheese and added sausage.  Killer omelette and to get it with my favorite home fries, sourdough toast and a strawberry lemonade?  I had another smile tattooed to my face walking out of Matt's this morning.  We got there around 9:45 and waited about 25 minutes for a table.  The weather was a perfect 70 degrees outside so no complaints here.  The service was top notch as always (just like the food)."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I travel all the way from Tucson monthly just to eat breakfast here. It's delicious. There's always great service and the food is the best. If you're in town, I'd check it out for sure!"}
{"text":"The good thing about going here alone ...its practically no wait. I came in got a seat right at the bar. Yay for me.  I order a coffee omg it was delicious home grown natural. I ordered the special three egg scramble with sundried tomato chicken sausage, button mushrooms and local baby organic spinach and fontina serve with potatoes and toast.  I also order a side of Bacon because I had to try it. THIS PLACE FOOD was so good and filling.. I will definently come back here when I come back to Phoenix.. It was very much worth the drive."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot! It can become very busy especially with the wait times but that just reminds you of how many people enjoy it! Friendly people and great food! Definitely,? recommend? ?coming here."}
{"text":"Breakfast surpassed my expectations. Service was good, food came pretty fast,  and was so delicious! We were in town visiting from California, and randomly picked on yelp due to it being conveniently  close by. Let me tell you, potatoes (cooked to perfection with rosemary) are so tasty, eggs fluffy, and the homemade jelly is Y-U-M. We had a slight issue and was remedied immediately by the manager. Awesome customer service- two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I go to Matt's quite frequently because I love the Hog n Chick. However, today when coming in, my company and I wanted to sit at the half booth and I was quite appalled at how the lady manager acted towards the decision, she said \"Uhm here? You don't want to sit at this two top?\" She made me feel like I was inconveniencing the entire establishment. Mind you.. It was a Tuesday morning on a 102 degree summer June day in Arizona....I work in the industry, and I would never act how she was acting towards a guest. So unprofessional. Other than that the staff is great and highly recommend their breakfast."}
{"text":"Seen it on Diners and drive ins. Went the next day. Great food. A little bit of a wait, but nothing terrible. Had breakfast and it was amazing. Pork chop for breakfast! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I went to Matt's Big Breakfast with my mother-in-law a few days ago and had a great experience.  It seems like everyone on this thread is already raving about this place, so I guess I'm just going to add more to it!  Yes, it's busy. So be prepared to wait for a table. Wife, her mom, and I waited for about half an hour for a table. But that was okay.   It's very simple, clean inside the restaurant. Their food portions were big and plenty.   Their country potatoes are stellar and so is their bacon. Eggs are eggs anywhere. It seems a lot of people liked the orange juice here, but I didn't try it.   Their coffee was great though! The server was very nice. But when we asked her about a few of the entrees, she wasn't very helpful because she said she didn't eat meat.   I think that's part of the reason I chose a more traditional breakfast. Eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast.   It was good though!"}
{"text":"Service here is great.  Despite how busy it gets, the food came promptly and the wait was bearable (though 30-40 minutes on a Sunday morning can be hard for those running short on time!).  It's funny how you can smell bacon/greasy meat before you even walk in!  I eventually got accustomed to it.  I didn't get to try the waffles, but their hash browns were soo good!  I will definitely come back again if I'm in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"We have heard of Matt's Big Breakfast  many times since moving out here to Phoenix. Our family from other states have heard of this place as it has been featured on Travel Channel & Food Network. So we finally decided to give this place a try to see what the big deal was all about.  Matt's actually moved down the street from their original location, which I had heard was very small. The new location which did appear much bigger, still had a long wait out side. There were a few benches that patrons can sit on & orange flavored water was offered outside for those waiting.   There was approx a 45min for out party of 4. Good thing we didn't come hungry. Once inside we were offered Bar seating, otherwise the wait would have been at least another 20 min. In my opinion, the bar stools were very slippery, or maybe it was just mine. I was wearing jeans, but I felt like I has to keep one leg on the ground in order not to slide off. & i'm kinda short so I was basically standing at the bar to eat.  Definitely a busy Breakfast spot. They state they use local resources & organic foods.   The food was tasty. I ordered the griddle cakes & they were BIG. I had to ask for more syrup which they said they would charge us another $1.50 for.   No one in our party was able to finish what we had ordered. We left with very full bellies.   Still not quite sure what all the hype is about. The act of supporting Small Business?Yes, we will always try to do that. Or maybe I just needed to order something more adventurous?  Know you must come with a BIG stomach, but not hungry, because the wait is ridiculous. At least we can cross this place off of our Food Bucket list  Happy Eating"}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast... Is it as good as everyone says? YES... It is absolutely worth every minute I had to wait. The atmosphere, the service, the food, all A+ in my book. I was surprised in how relatively cheap it is to eat at Matt's concerning the incredibly fresh ingredients. I highly recommend that you make this a stop in at Matt's Big Breakfast, it will never dissapoint."}
{"text":"This place is great. Simple menu and great prices. It does get a little crowed and can have a wait but it sure is worth it. I have also done pick up on a saturday and I was in and out and under 5 min."}
{"text":"So good! Food is always fresh, good portions and service is always fast. Best part is, breakfast is served all day!!  And if you enjoy a good Bloody Mary from time to time, this place really knows how to serve them up. Ask for the house Bloody Mary with their famous crispy bacon! Amazing!!"}
{"text":"My husband's favorite meal of the day is breakfast, so while we were in the area I decided to take him to the much ballyhooed Matt's Big Breakfast.  The line wasn't unreasonable, especially for a Saturday midmorning.  Food was served quickly and was made with fresh ingredients, but choices were surprisingly limited...no biscuits and gravy, no chicken fried steak, no quiche.  I just assumed, based on the name, that they'd offer every breakfast item under the sun.  My husband got the omelet of the day and said it was pretty good.  I got the pesto chicken sandwich, and it was alright.  We were both underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Big breakfast is a bit of an overstatement considering you can get the same-size meal or a larger one at a chain breakfast joint for less. Really, the only thing big is the check. Talk about overpriced!  The food is okay. The pancakes are very light and fluffy, but the hash browns were soggy and gross. I don't think the coffee was all that fresh, either.  The customer service is also lacking. I almost got the feeling that my table was being avoided. I sat without water for almost the entirety of my meal while a server walking around with a pitcher visited every other table. I guess I'll be sure to bring my own water bottle if I ever come back!"}
{"text":"On our way down from Paradise Valley we decided to go to Matt's Big Breakfast for brunch based on Meg's past visit for The Breakfast Club. Even at 10:30, the place was packed full to bursting with a large group of people waiting outside. After a twenty minute wait I found out why. The service was very quick and friendly and the food was great. I ordered the five spot breakfast sandwich. While the sandwich only came on it's own, it was easy to understand why when it arrive. The sandwich took up most of the plate with what was likely 2-3 eggs, two strips of bacon, and cheese all on a roll bigger than a softball. Honestly, if I could, I'd come for the bacon alone. Very thick cut and choice slices and well seasoned. The eggs were well cooked and very fresh and the roll was very light and flaky. I would definitely come back again though I would recommend coming early to beat the crowds if you can."}
{"text":"Oh Matt,  Why-O, why-O did you have to move? Who cares that your old place was small? It was part of the quaint location. No matter.....your food is still worth waiting in the beaming heat. Keep it up with the 'no microwave' & local produce kitchen. Cheers!"}
{"text":"They only serve whole milk with coffee. You ask for cream but they don't carry it. They won't poacher eggs, my eggs were not cooked thoroughly even though I asked for over easy. My has been asked for a little bit of maple syrup with his waffle and I told him it would cost $1.69 more because it's pure maple sera up. Won't be back again and we fly frequently. Took over 35 minutes just to get our breakfast this morning on Saturday at 8 AM."}
{"text":"After all the hype around this place we happened to be down-town and decided to give it a try. I'll be honest it was good food but nothing amazing, I am just glad there wasn't a wait when we went otherwise I think our expectations would have been much higher. I got the griddlecakes because I read they are a must to try and my husband got the Chop & Chick (pork chop with eggs). The pancakes were good, I would say comparable to the good egg, but I would choose the good egg over Matt's. The husband's pork chop had a lot of flavor with a nice crispy outside served with your standard scrambled eggs and above par hash browns. The one thing we got which I will say was very good would be the thick-cut bacon. It was cooked perfectly and for a side order you got 3 huge slices which was enough for us to share. I would come back here however, I would definitely try the BLT because of that bacon, but I don't see myself waiting more than 15-20min for a seat."}
{"text":"Great waffles, buttery & fluffy. Awesome syrup too. Bacon was perfectly crisp, and even had a nice amount of grease on the strips to add some moist texture. Honey lemonade was very refreshing. Great little place for a simple, well done, breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Good breakfast, a tad over-hyped. Big portions and a good deal. GOOD, fresh juice! Would definitely go back. However it's always packed and there is normally a wait. Tried weekdays to avoid the rush but it's just a hot spot! Work checking out for sure. Be prepared to spend a little time. Staff was wonderful!"}
{"text":"If I'm flying out of terminal 4 then I'm eating at Matt's Big Breakfast.  Even if my flight is at 10:00 or noon or 2:00.  Even if I have to traipse the rest of the way around the terminal to my Southwest gate, it's worth it to me to get here early and have a delicious breakfast.  They have the best bacon for sure, and the staff has always been fast and friendly.  Maybe someday I'll try something else, but for me the hog and chick is the way to go.  Love everything about this breakfast from the bacon to the roasted potatoes to the homemade raspberry preserves on the fresh baked marble rye toast.    Delicious!"}
{"text":"Read about Matt's Big Breakfast on Triple D.  So far, Guy has not let us down.  If you love bacon, you have to check out the smoked Applewood bacon.  Even if you are not a  bacon lover, you'll fall in love with these nice smokey slices.  Nice and thick and cooked to perfection.    I had the Hog and Chick with thick sliced bacon.  3 slices bacon, 2 eggs, hash browns or home fries and your choice of toast.  What is the difference between hash browns and home fries you ask....hash browns are shredded potatoes cooked in butter.  Home fries are chunks of potatoes cooked in olive oil, rosemary and onions.    Hubby had the special of the day.  3 meat scramble with hash browns and flour tortillas.  This is definitely a meat lover's delight.  They do not skimp on the meats either.  Canadian bacon, Chipotle  and Cheddar sausage and Spicy sausage and cheese.  One drawback, parking lot is very small and difficult to maneuver around if you have a large car.  The staff were all helpful and friendly albeit a bit slow with coffee refills.  Some say breakfast is on the pricey side.  However you get a lot of bang for your buck!  Definitely recommend you check out Matt's if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, the staff knows the menu well and they are all so nice! Wish there was one in Colorado. Loved the waffle and the bacon Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Everyone says they really like this place. I have to say it was good. Especially for being in the airport it was a nice change from the usual. We had a long flight in front of us so I wanted to eat a real meal. So we went to Matts. We had a small bit of a wait. They were packed very popular place. We were seated and quickly served. Our server was great! She was fast, refilled out drinks and even brought us a to go box. Sorry to say I do not remember her name. as this was before we went on vacation. A lot has happened since then. The food was good but, not great. I got the pancakes that I ordered with my meal when I was almost through with my breakfast.  I realize they are very busy. It was decent. I would go back. Maybe when I am not so rushed. The price is a bit high I think. But, it is the Airport and rents are high there.  I will give it a go another time. Coffee was good. Service was great , food was so so."}
{"text":"Love this place it was rustic it was fun it was happening and the food was bloody spectacular great service great attitude"}
{"text":"Breakfast does not get any better.  After eating the bacon at this restaurant, I can't order bacon at any other breakfast joints... it simply does not compare.  They use thick, smoked bacon that is incredible.  Definitely worth the extra dollars."}
{"text":"Simply put, my favorite breakfast in Phoenix.  No other breakfast joint can match the deliciousness that is Matt's Big Breakfast.  The waffle is still my go-to meal, as it is the right amount of fluffiness.  Plus it comes with bacon!  And the bacon here is amazing... thick, peppery, and cooked just right.  I have a hard time ordering bacon at any other restaurant as it simply does not compare with Matt's.  The daily special usually consists of an egg scramble and a side of potatoes and is wonderful as well.  The food here cannot be beat.  Now that they've moved to a larger location, too, going to eat is more reasonable.  The wait can still be long during peak hours, but it's not nearly as bad as it once was.  The restaurant still maintains its character even with a new home.  If I had to pick one restaurant to take a friend for breakfast, this would be it.  Breakfast at its finest."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Its super tiny but the food comes out pretty quickly and they turn tables fast. I ordered the special which had eggs, ham, Fresno peppers, and cheese and came with hashbrowns. Everything was absolutely delicious. Their toast, as well, was a huge highlight. We didn't wait long because we called beforehand and were put on the list. They don't really have a host/hostess, you just write your name on the list, which I found interesting. I spent most of the meal gawking at one of their employees, Travis, who was absolutely adorable. I wish they had eggs benedict, but the food they had definitely made up for it."}
{"text":"Best eggs Benedict  I've ever had in all my travels! Highly recommended especially if you have kids. Lots of food! Come hungry"}
{"text":"The breakfast was just okay. It was expensive for the daily special, and the potatoes that the waitress recommended were not fully cooked and a little under done. I would not probably return or recommend."}
{"text":"tasty pasty!    my favorite part of my experience was the butter and the jam. DEEELISSHHHH.   i could hardly make a dent in my pancakes but I couldn't just let that butter go to waste, so i put the rest of the butter on a piece of pancake and ate that. it would have been weird if i just ate the butter, but i would have. I got the rest to go and asked for extra butter to come along with it. I think the pancakes were amazing, but it could have just been that butter.   I must have thought I hadn't eaten in years bc I also ordered the bacon which is the best bacon i've ever had. let's add that to my list of best part. bacon, strawberry jam, and butter. healthy eating at it's finest.   I also had the homefries but they needed salt and didn't go well w the ketchup they are served with.   I would go back and order strawberry jam toast,  mountain of butter, and 12 slices of bacon."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the neighborhood as we had taken our daughter to check out PHX zoo. We heard about this place from diners, drive in and dives and had to check it out.  we were starving and had a wait for a full two hours prior to being seated! :( This place is a hole in the wall!! However, the breakfast was worth the wait! My wife had the bacon and waffle and enjoyed it so much that she ordered another order of the waffle. I had the special which was to die for, scrambled eggs with turkey sausage, peppers and cheese.  will definitely come back if we are nearby!!"}
{"text":"I will go 3 stars instead of 2 because it is in an airport. I sat down and was greeted by an unhappy, unhelpful bartender. I ordered food right away. After 25 minutes I asked her very politely to check on my food, as I had a plane to catch. She snapped back that the kitchen got busy. I told her I was not upset, I just had to get going. She went on to snap back that everything is made fresh so it takes time. I got a medium rare burger. Shouldn't take 25 minutes in an airport. When I did get my burger it was less than mediocre. I love burgers, it is hard for me to be unhappy with one, especially when it is supposedly cooled in butter. Meh.  I normally fly out of concourse A, I wss really excited to be in B to try this place. Next time, I will take a walk to another concourse. I won't be back here."}
{"text":"I miss Matt's!  I haven't been able to find decent, let alone great breakfast in LA.   What I like: - The coffee.  Seriously people. What are you bitching about the coffee for?  I'm guessing most of you are Starbuck's frequenters that think over-roasted burnt beans = delicious coffee? That a macchiato is really a sugary drink with lots of milk?  That drinking a coffee concoction containing 1000+ calories daily is good for you?  That's what I thought. - The daily specials.  The bacon, spinach and cheese omelet they do sometimes is amazing.  If you are *lucky* enough to walk in on the rare occasion they are making French toast, well then you had better order it while you can.  Best freakin' French toast I've ever eaten! - The ingredients.  Fresh, local and organic. - The staff.  They are awesome.  Enough said. - The size.  I like the fact that it is small and quaint and that you can peer at your neighboring table's order.  And even say hello...try making a new friend instead of whining.   - The prices.  Perfect.  What I don't like: - That it is in Phoenix and not LA.  Tips: - Don't bring your kids.  - Order your hash browns well done.  They are PERFECT that way. - If you aren't a fan of waiting a little bit, go to Denny's.  Or go early! - Don't go to a diner if you only eat health food.  It's not called Matt's Granola & Fruit Bar....."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best traditional breakfast place in the valley. My boyfriend and I are huge foodies so we have eaten at almost every breakfast place in town. Matt's has the best bacon and hash browns I've ever had. Their bacon is thick-cut, seasoned with maple and black pepper. Their hashbrowns (and probably everything else on the menu) probably have three tablespoons of butter in them, but trust me its worth it. There is usually a wait, so be prepared. But just do what we do and go there anticipating an hour wait, not when you're starving. Sip some cave creek coffee and enjoy the day while you wait. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"First time trying out this place after all the hype online...sad to say I was unimpressed and pretty disappointed with the service, menu and prices. Our waitress was unwelcoming and seemed bored or angry. She brought my 2 year old a glass of milk in an actual glass with no lid and no straw. We had to ask for a child's cup which they did have(wtf). She refused to make any exceptions or changes to the menu items at our request. We were not allowed to substitute anything without paying for it. The menu is fairly small and uninspired for a breakfast place. Pretty basic. The prices were high though, I paid 10.95 for a burger which was actually really good(earned the 1 star on this review). The other items ranged from 1.50 for 1 egg(lol) I can buy a whole carton for that price, up to 13ish. They only have basic drinks as well. Plain old coffee, tea and lemonade. The chocolate milk was $3.25!!!  When the bill came we asked to have the items split between my friend and I, the waitress refused and said she couldn't do that. Ok so we asked for two separate checks then, she said she couldn't do that either!!!! Wtf?? So we got a little testy with her and asked for her manager. She went off and came back with two split checks lol saying her manager helped her-whatever. So rude and I would never come back here. Not worth the money for stuff that IHOP has.  Go to snooze down the street, so much better all around and cheaper!"}
{"text":"I had the Chop and Chick with a Honey Strawberry Lemonade. This food was BOMB! The only knock I have is that due to the small size you are rushed to eat. The wait staff comes by often asking \"can I take that plate.\" I still had half a porkchop on my plate! As for food though.... It was really good!!!! Indefinitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Solid. Just had a trip to Phoenix to pick up a Diamondbacks game and tried Matt's Big Breakfast, well, for breakfast. I read the reviews for this place and decided to choose it based on the high rating.  Had eggs, bacon, toast and the OJ. It was easily one of the best breakfasts I've had. When I visit again, I'll go back for sure and highly recommend it to anyone looking for breakfast.  The price was about right for the organic and natural foods they offer. It's probably a little more than most tiny breakfasts stops, but knowing the food served was chosen from natural food markets, the price was spot on for the quality of food.  There was a wait because the restaurant was tiny, but well worth the wait. Trust me, definitely swing by this breakfast diner. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Staffing needs work. I'm at an airport. I want a breakfast burrito. They took my order and 20 min later I asked for a refund. Ni complaints from me. I just have to go. There are 4 burritos ahead of me. Manager starts yelling at the staff, refunds my order and takes someone's elses burrito and gives it to me. I'm like look its ok I don't want you to throw together an order. Relax. He doesn't. Burrito that he hands me after I take it and run to my flight, is completely different and a mess nor cooked."}
{"text":"The Chick and Chop is one of my breakfast favorites. Ask for CHELSIE at the front counter.   Excellent service, food and coffee...TOP QUALITY."}
{"text":"Great find on our trip to Phoenix!   Breakfast was great and service was even better.  Very friendly staff!  The breakfast sandwich was amazing and the grilled onions added great flavor.   The salami omelette was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. So hearty, quick and amazing service. Felt like I had a good ole fashioned diner breakfast that got classed up in a great environment. Definitely get the country ham!"}
{"text":"This was a good honest breakfast.  Love the lemonades made with honey.  I have tried to duplicate but still trying.  I would have breakfast here every Saturday if I lived there"}
{"text":"THE BEST EVERYTHING. I love how they use REAL maple syrup and just real ingredients in general. I live in Tempe but the boy and I go the extra mile to come here. Love breakfast food and LOVE Matt's!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good! I hate waiting in line to get into restaurants, but Matt's is actually worth the wait. I would have given them 5 stars, but I have to give one star to the Farmer's Market a block away that made the wait fun and enjoyable. Support local farmers AND support your belly."}
{"text":"There are times when Phoenix tries my patience, event though I am here only a year.  Why, as someone else more accurately put it, are there only  two decent breakfast places?  Please, if someone knows of another, I'll be grateful for the kind referral!  The pluses:  the best home fries, real sour dough toast, very excellent marmalade  The average: decent, above average omelets and waffles, fresh butter  The minuses: the usual 30-45min wait, cramped, stuffy setting, waitresses are so busy, they bring the check right after the meal, no bathroom  All I can say is I miss real, well done home fries and crepes!  Where are you Chez Vachon?"}
{"text":"We came as a group of people and they refused to split the bill for us. They asked us to calculate ourselves. The girl who did that didn't even have good attitude. She said it and walked away.  The place itself is very small and tables are next to each other. I wouldn't say that's comfortable. The food is okay."}
{"text":"The perfect breakfast place! We visited the 1st street location downtown. I ordered the cheese omelet with veggies and home fries that were deliciously seasoned with rosemary and it was very good. I would recommend the home fries over the hash browns. I also had a side waffle that was perfectly fluffy. For any vegetarians, they don't substitute any of their meat options unless you want tomatoes, but they do price correct your meal if you don't want meat."}
{"text":"Good food and good service.  I really like the food and I've been here two times with a friend who referred me, and once on my own.  They have home-made bread and jam, and good food overall with good portions.  Daily specials will change frequently over a morning or afternoon, and the specials are good--unique.  Now for why I didn't get it all 5 stars:  It's pretty busy all the time, which means packed, which means you probably will have to wait.  That's the mark of a good restaurant, and they are quite efficient at getting people in and out, and served efficiently.  You will usually have to wait in a line to pay, but often the wait staff will take it up for you.  Tables are very close together and you are right on top of your neighboring diners.  Most of all, it's so noisy you can hardly hear yourself and your tablemate talk.  If you are by yourself, you will be put at the counter, period.  They rightfully maximize space. The environment is a little overwhelming.  But the service and food are good.  One a single one-room bathroom is inside each for the Guys & Gals, and there was a line each of my visits.  Even if you are not waiting, if other people are in line, they can be right in front of your table where you're eating.  It's a small place that is open for breakfast and lunch and does a booming business.  I've only been here for breakfast and I would go back with my friend."}
{"text":"Ate there once with family.  So noisy in there you can't even hear yourself chew. Everyone talking, they need to do something about the acoustics. The food was good"}
{"text":"Get the salami scramble and enjoy.   Great service and amazing food makes the wait almost bearable, but sometimes you just want quality breakfast without putting your name in and getting dolled up  for the paparazzi.   In the end I'll continue to go and wait in the line, but I don't have to like it."}
{"text":"Great customer service and great tasting food! Their fresh lemonades are AWESOME, they are very quick when it comes to service. If there's a wait, it's worth waiting!"}
{"text":"Classic case of overhype leading to disappointment. After waiting 30 minutes to get sat, we ordered off their tiny, tiny breakfast menu.  I ordered a cheese omelet and waffle. The waffle was excellent the rest was blah. The eggs in my omelet were not scrabbled all the way so chunks of yolks kept presenting themselves and they clearly added the cheese at the last second because it wasn't melted. The home fries were greasy and had no seasoning besides rosemary. I had to cover everything in salt until I finally gave up and left the greasy mess on my plate. On the plus side my husband enjoyed his breakfast and the service was good"}
{"text":"Yes, the menu looks small and simple, but this place is really good!  I went for breakfast. We both had eggs.  My eggs were eggs. But, the eggs with salami were really yummy and salty. The hash browns and home fires were awesome! Some of the best I'd ever had.  The toast was delicious and came with (I think homemade) blackberry preserves. So good!  And my coffee and water glass was never empty.    We went on a weekday at 7:30 and there was no wait."}
{"text":"Went to Matt's Big Breakfast before our morning flight out of PHX airport after seeing reviews here.   We were lucky to find them open on Monday since they were not open Mondays in the past.  There was no wait for our party of two and were promptly greeted and informed of the daily special.  The waitress was very nice and attentive.   I had the special which was a three egg scramble with canadian bacon and locally grown asparagus along with home fries.  K had the eggs, bacon, and hash browns.  Both meals came with toast and preserves.  Both the wheat and sourdough toast were thick slices and very fresh.  Everything was  fresh and tasty.  (Total bill $22.)  We will definitely be stopping back here in future trips to the area as it was a delicious meal.  I highly recommend this place to anyone although it is so very small that it is a good idea to get there early (they open at 630) seeing as we got there at 730 and by 815 there was a line to sit."}
{"text":"Its been a long time since my last visit to Matt's.  I used to make the pilgrimage pretty regularly to their old location, but hadn't taken in the new place.  Boy, what an upgrade.  Their old place was essentially a shack that (somehow) managed to cram about 20 people inside.  It was a cool place and was unique to the neighborhood, but it was really crowded inside and the wait times could be epic.  The new place is roomier, can seat twice as many patrons, and feels much more like a neighborhood restaurant than a corner hole in the wall.  The wait outside can still be long at times, but at least now you won't feel as cramped inside as you do waiting in line.  Not wanting to wait in line, but wanting a hearty breakfast, I came here at about 7am on a Saturday.  Just came by myself and grabbed a stool.  My server told me its usually just after 8am on Saturday that it gets busy and the lines start to form.  So my timing was perfect.  Even at 7am the place was a little over half full, but no wait time.  The patrons I saw ran the gambit from families with kids, to ASU Downtown students, to workers in suits, to neighborhood artists.  Similar to what I remembered at Matt's old place.  For my meal, I went with the Salami Scramble.  Molinari salami mixed with scrambled eggs and accompanied by toast with homemade strawberry preserves and hash browns (you can substitute home fries if you want).  To wash it all down I went with their fresh squeezed lemonade mixed with honey.  Unusual drink mixing the sweetness of the honey with the acidic taste of the lemonade, but very good.  The scramble was incredible as the salami had just the right amount of kick, wasn't oily and they didn't skimp on the salami portions.  The strawberry preserves tasted very fresh and accompanied the sourdough toast perfectly.  Total cost for the scramble and sides, lemonade, tax, and tip was $15.  Good deal given the hearty portions I received in return.  The server was very friendly and the staff were all alert, attentive, and in good spirits even this early on a Saturday morning.  As with their old location, the detractors would probably tell you the biggest negative about this place is the wait.  Even now that they have a new location twice as big as the old one, the wait can still get long.  Take it from the waitress I talked to, get here before 8am if you can.  I did and was in and out in 30 minutes.  Matt's has a following for a good reason.  Great portions of hearty, locally sourced food at reasonable prices.  A legion of fans will tell you its worth the wait.  Count me among them."}
{"text":"Damn where to start... hash browns are amazing, the honey lemonade is delicious, the bacon omg... I get lost in the rich fatty piece of heaven lol. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast is the real deal - celebrating tons of local ingredients and making everything from scratch. But the wait can be killer.  We were a party of three going to Matt's about noon on a Sunday. I had heard about the wait, but the hour we sat there was still pretty rough. Once we were seated, though, the service was fast and friendly.  Our friend (who's a local) told us the best thing on the menu was The Hog & Chick, so that's what all of us ordered. I was totally pleased with everything:  * Coffee - from a local roaster * OJ - freshly squeezed (in a teeny tiny glass) * Eggs - fresh and local * Potatoes - buttery, herbed, and delicious * Toast - thick, buttery, and delicious * Preserves - homemade at Matt's and super delish * ham - a giant slab of serious goodness  The price was very reasonable too - especially for the quality of food. For all the items listed above, I paid about $15. Next time I'm in the area, I'll totally go back to Matt's, but I'll try to pick an obscure time when the wait isn't quite so bad."}
{"text":"Food was great!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and worth the wait.  My sis and I showed up at 10 am on a Wednesday morning.  Had to wait about 5 min.  All waitresses care about everyone and not just their own table.  Sis had the chop n chik.. I had the special...  Some sort of vienna Guada sausage scramblers with cheese....  AHhh-- mazingly good!!!   Juice, preserves, and milk all taste super fresh.  Some of the best hashbrowns I have ever tasted.  Have the perfect crispyness but yet the right texture in the middle."}
{"text":"I've been reading a lot of reviews about Matt's big breakfast so I stopped in to give it a try. I have to say I was a bit disappointed in the size of my meal. It wasn't BIG at all. The tables were very small to, barley enuf room to fit two people. The restaurant itself is small to,very little seating. We had to wait for about 30min. before being seated. The food is just ok,I won't be coming back. Matt's breakfast would be an appropriate non misleading name."}
{"text":"Busy place! Delicious fresh squeezed orange juice. I probably could have just ordered a gallon for breakfast. Service varied - some people were great but a few that seemed like they didn't care. Pancakes a little dry."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife and I had the chick and chop. I am not exaggerating when I say that it was the juiciest pork chop I've ever had. The sour dough bread that came with it was very good and you can tell that its home made or at least bought from a local bakery. My wife had the waffle which came with 2 strips of thick cut bacon. We also had the freshly squeezed OJ which tasted as advertised. I will definitely come back and recommend this place to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"There's a long time to get in for a reason!  Best service, best food.  It's a place you have to try and fall in love with."}
{"text":"One of the best steaks for breakfast EVER!  Perfectly cooked w/ awesome flavor. A bit loud inside, but fantastic service, great food, and extremely reasonable.  I hardly ever give 5 stars, but I can give this place all 5 without hesitation!"}
{"text":"Incredible servings and consistently good food. Better come early or be prepared to wait - there is a long line for a reason."}
{"text":"This is the idyllic breakfast stop for all you yelping food fanatics. Matt's is an upscale diner that will keep you believing breakfast really is the most important meal of the day; no matter how many carbs you just ate. My game plan was to order a meal and save half of it for later or even the next day; unfortunately, it was sooo good that I just couldn't stop.  When they asked me what type of toast I wanted I half shrugged it off as just give me the \"whatever\" flavor and I won't eat it anyway. I generally stay away from generic tasting food in an effort to make my calories count for at the very least and awesome tasting meal.  Even the toast was awesome! If they didn't bake the loaf of bread that my toast came from just as I was making my order, you could have foolded me. The hashbrowns were awesome, so much that I ate them all.  I wish I knew how to make my scrambled eggs taste like Matt does. You will not be dissapointed with any meal you order here.  Words just don't give this breakfast joint justice, so be sure to check out all the pictures!  Expect to pay about $10-11 per person after tax and tip for one of these awesome breakfast meals.  **WARNING** Don't eat here if you are looking for just another breakfast place. **"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast joint in the valley of the sun.   I have been here many times and the average wait time is about an hour.... but is totally worth it!  Food:  The food here is great!  Everything is freshly made and full of favor!  My favorite is their pork chop with eggs... and you must get their rosemary home fries and wheat toast!   Also thick cut bacon as a side!  The bacon is what keeps bringing me back to this place.   They are thick cut and peppered... 3 slices for $2.95 might be a little pricy but they are really good!    Their daily specials are also very good, most of the time is some type of egg/ sausage scramble.  I also love their homemade bread and jam.  Matt's switches up their jam favors.  Service:  Their staff is great!  Very friendly and attentive.  But you must prepare to wait... the only time that I didn't have to wait was when I got there 10 mins before opening.   Otherwise prepare to wait at least 1 hour.   They new location is more than twice the size of the old location, but wait time is still very long, especially you have a large group."}
{"text":"First time eating here and ordered the burger. The burger was good and was big. I tried the bacon and the waffles and have to say the waffles were amazing. Bacon was thick and had a nice pepper flavor."}
{"text":"Great Food. Great Coffee. Great Service. Amazing Hash-browns! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"1. Best bacon i have ever had. 2. The sourdough toast and blueberry jam was delicious.  Seems like those two things did it for me, but not necessarily.... I ordered the hog and chick(wanted their french toast special bit french toast and sausage was just not enough of choices). Over medium eggs, 3 pieces of bacon(thick crunchy bacon may i add), hash browns and sourdough toast with jam. Water to drink. Eggs were nothing special but still delish. Hash browns were a little too buttery for my taste but definitely not your average tasting which i definitely enjoyed. Bacon was the best i have ever had as already mentioned, it was seasoned just right and no sogginess, all crispyness. The sourdough toast i could really keep eating. Im not sure if it was the toast or the jam but it was just perfection. Water- no sink water taste. ;-) Overall it was really good. Party of 3 only had to wait 5 minutes at 11am on Tuesday. I guess this is rare but we were fortunate. Service was friendly but did feel rushed at times. But as you see still 5 stars because at the end the food was the star.  Note - coworker had the waffles and said its one of if  not the best they ever tasted."}
{"text":"Food here is good however the service can suck at this location. I ate at the downtown location earlier this week and had a great experience. I stopped in for a to go order at the Camelback location and Riley took my order but was very short and rude. I understand  restaurants get busy however that's not an excuse for poor service."}
{"text":"Delicious and filling breakfast. It is always super busy. The downside? No parking. The parking in the back of the building is for the Velo"}
{"text":"I journeyed off after on my quest to find a good breakfast spot. Decided to drive to Phx and give Matt's a try.   Parking isn't easy. My super hero foresight made me move my car just in the nick of time! Sorry for the truck that got the ticket.. Anyhow not a big selection to choose from. I decided to have two eggs over easy, off the bone ham(extra$), hash browns, wheat bread, and a Coffee..coffee was okay just coffee...not that I was expecting more..plate came up right away. Looked good. Ham was great! Would make a great sandwich with cheese. Eggs were eggs..Hash browns were good but I have a better idea...they were crunchy on outside and oily in the middle, it's bot bad just missing something... I would NOT stand in a ridiculous line for this place...."}
{"text":"I just needed to get something to eat before my connecting flight. Lucky to find this place. Good food and really friendly staff. Made me feel like I was at a local hangout."}
{"text":"You gotta love Matt's -- but, don't you miss the bright, sunny old place (assuming you could get a seat!) as opposed to the concrete-bunker feel of the new place? Plus, while tiny tables made sense in a tiny spot, the tiny 2-tops in the new place give you no room at all.  I had the oatmeal (served just barely lukewarm), their wonderful bacon, and coffee.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast has got to be one of the best breakfast spots in Arizona. I've been going to Matt's for as long as I can remember, and it never disappoints. I could never get enough of their house fries, which consists of yummy potatoes, onions and rosemary cooked just right. Try their belgian waffle and the specials they have. Oh and prepare for the long wait!"}
{"text":"A buddy of mine invited me to breakfast. Payment for fixing his computer. We meet on location and as I pull up, my friend is sitting outside and signals me to park around the back. The back parking lot was full, so I parked on 1 street, having to feed the meter. As I walk up I notice people outside waiting, so I sit on the bench next to my buddy out front for about three minutes when one of the girls calls us, we're next. The place is small and the atmosphere is loud because of the small space, but hey, this is downtown phoenix, who cares. I ordered the triple stack pancakes with a side of sunny side up eggs and a order of bacon. My buddy ordered the Pork Chop breakfast with potatoes. The food was great, all home made. The only thing that bothered me was there was no reg sugar, just brown. Next time I will have to bring my own sweet and low for the coffee. Girls are cute, service was great. I would definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives on the Food Network and I knew I had to go if ever in the Phoenix area. As luck would have it I was out there this weekend for a wedding and this place was on my must visit list. Even at 10:30am on a Friday there is a line out the door for this place. We happily waited the 30 minutes and it was well worth the wait. The husband had the pork chop and eggs served with hash browns and thick hand cut toast. I opted for the breakfast special of the day which was a hot link scramble with fresh jalapenos and cheddar served with a warm tortilla and hash browns. I will go on record as saying this is the best breakfast I have ever had. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the tortilla warm and fresh, the hash browns were crispy (not greasy) on the outside and perfect on the inside. We couldn't resist trying the pancake made from scratch as well. Fluffy and light served with warm maple syrup. YUM!  We didn't have room for all this food but we wanted to make sure we sampled all Matt's had to offer. WOW great food , excellent prices and warm friendly service. This is a must visit local breakfast joint in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Like most great places, a review isn't necessary, so I haven't done so.  My latest visit gave me the need to do so, though.  I needn't say what's already been said, as most of the reviews are the same.  1) You will wait, no matter what time of day or time of year.  Hot summer mornings, early, will have the shortest wait.  If you've never been here, what you do is show up, write down your name and the number of people in your party, snag some water and find some shade.  It's suggested you have good company or a book - you can get bored waiting!  2) All the food is good.  All the food is fresh.  If there is a daily special, get it.  3) Everyone rants and raves about the potatoes.  I could remove one star just to prove a point, but this is a five star place.  The hashbrowns are good because of the potatoes.  They are extremely fresh and full-flavored, unlike anything you get at most restaurants.  That said, they're not the *WORLDS GREATEST HASHBROWNS EVERRRRRRRRRRRR*.  They're fantastic, but they are a bit mushy on the inside.  They are possibly the very best potatoes in town, all said and done.  4) Four Barrel coffee is served here now, instead of Cave Creek.  I'm all for this.  Despite it not being local, it is better than a lot of local roasts.  5) Go here."}
{"text":"I decided to stop here in the airport while I waited for my flight. Although they were busy I was greeted and automatically offered a drink and menu. I ordered the Matt's big breakfast with medium well eggs. Everything was really good, kind of with it was cooked just a tad bit longer for the eggs. However, the potatoes were perfectly seasoned the pancake was just right light sweet flavor to it and everything else was just right. I enjoyed the food and customer service. I'd go back when visiting."}
{"text":"This place gets so packed! I had to see what all the rave was about and I'm just not too sure. Their menu had very typical items that are prepared as expected. No knock against the place, but it has nothing that would bring me back."}
{"text":"Top notch food and service, done quickly and with a good understanding attitude. My BLT was fresh, with tomatoes that tasted like tomatoes should and fresh crisp lettuce on some great bread.  My buddy had a breakfast that was also fresh, plentiful and delicious. There's an amazing amount of good food in the Phoenix airport, yet this stands out for both great food and service."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Food is amazing and Fresh. I like going out of my comfort zone and ordering the special. I've never been disapointed and I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"When in downtown Phoenix, this is a \"must stop\"!  A short wait, excellent service and a tasty breakfast served until 2:30 pm. The pork and apple sausage had a great snap to it. The hash browns were crispy, buttery, and had a hint of sweetness. Definitely, put Matt's on your list."}
{"text":"First time at Matt' Big Breakfast. Arrived at 10:15 on a Saturday morning and waited 20 mins: much less than most reviewers.   My son-in-law and I both ordered identical breakfasts: the special meal and drink of the day. We each got the Three Egg omelette with Schriner's Chorizo a jalapeños and it came with potatoes. We both got a side of sausage and a Strawberry Honey Lemonade.   It arrived in about 10 mins. The eggs were nicely cooked and the potatoes were cooked crispy, just as I prefer them. The sausage were a bit small for the price but I got full anyway. The drink was too sweet and would've been better without the honey.    Overall a good experience. I will bring my gluten-intolerant wife and see what she thinks next time."}
{"text":"Nothing special about the oatmeal.  Service was decent but felt rushed- which is fine- I get it- we're at an airport....But then when I did want to leave I couldn't get my card run until I stood up to leave. But worst of all:  THE COFFEE WAS HORRIBLE!  Guys, this is a breakfast restraint and you can't make a half way decent cup of strong coffee?  I've had water that had more flavor!!"}
{"text":"http://stevelerer.com  I traveled to Phoenix only a few days away from the LA marathon in March and was determined to start carbo loading early. My first stop was Matt's Big Breakfast, a place I had patroned back in 2010. That time I ordered the item that Guy tried on triple D and it was really good. He ordered the chop and the chick which was a pork chop and two fried eggs. It was delicious, with a great pesto topping, I only wished I could have had more pesto but they may have given it to me if I had asked.  The restaurant is small usually with a 10 minute wait even for one person. I didn't mind and hung out with the locals for a little bit before I was able to sit at the bar. The decor and ambiance is not much different than most other small breakfast spots but it is clean and welcoming. The staff was nice and took my order quickly and it was only a short while before my order of the hog and the chick was in front of me. Placed at my spot of the counter was beautifully cooked think cut peppered bacon, crispy hashbrowns, and two perfectly cooked over medium eggs. Everything on the plate was cooked really well and was a perfect breakfast. The eggs were right under medium which is where I like them and the hashbrowns were crunchy and crispy on the outside while still creamy on the inside. Somewhat like a potato latke, just without all the onion. By far the star on the plate was the think cut bacon. Sometimes when a restaurant says that the bacon is think cut it really isn't and other times it is so thick that it comes out uncooked. Matt's got it just right and peppered right to the edge of too much. Just where I like it. I could have eaten platefuls of this stuff, if only they were in LA at the end of the marathon.  The last thing in my order was the real reason I returned to Matt's. Each breakfast arrives with a side of bread of which you have a few options. Bread aside, the start was the strawberry jam they served on the side. The jam is without a doubt the best thing in the restaurant. It is super sweet with chunks of fruit inside. It has so much flavor in such a simple concoction, I could eat a jar of it. Too bad they only give you about two ounces. I wonder if they bottle and sell it because I would buy.  All in all Matt's Big Breakfast is a really solid breakfast joint in downtown Phoenix. No wonder it always has a wait. The peppered bacon was delicious and the rest of the meal was nothing to scoff at but, in the end, I would come here every time I visit Phoenix just for the strawberry jam. Check out Matt's Big Breakfast the next time you are in town and let me know what you think.  Overall Review: 7/10"}
{"text":"I've been going to the location in downtown Phoenix for years so I was so thrilled to find out that there's one that's a lot closer to me. I found that this location is not as busy. Generally, the quality of food is the same as the one in downtown Phoenix.   The hog and chick is their basic breakfast - delicious, peppered, thick cut bacon paired with perhaps the best breakfast potatoes I have ever had. The way they make their potatoes is absolutely perfect. Yukon gold with onions and rosemary cooked just right. Salami Scramble is excellent as well. My boyfriend always gets one of their specials that has jalapeños in it (I can't remember what it's called!) and he loves it.  Their pancakes are to die for. We have just discovered how good it is a few weeks ago, and couldn't believe how amazing they taste. Their waffles are delightful as well. I have yet to try their lunch menu.  Their service has always been decent. Can't say that it's great or top notch, hence the 4 stars. I've read some of the reviews here and I agree that the male host (or manager?) can be rude and off at times. My boyfriend and I have agreed that he seemed like he didn't want to be there.    If I were just to rate the food, it would no doubt be 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"At the bar I ordered the standard two egg breakfast, named some kind of hipster BS like two chicks and a pig or something. I opted for fruit instead of the home fries. My server was prompt and the drinks / food came quickly, however, the fruit was so old looking I couldn't bring myself to eat it. One of my pet peeves is wasting food so I can't recall a time I sent something back but in this case I was willing to forego that side all together. The server tried without me asking to get a fresher bowl but she even admitted upon her return from the kitchen that it all looked unappetizing. She didn't offer another side of anything else to make up for the rotten fruit. If you have the time for a sit down meal, take a moment to find another eatery. In hindsight, I'm sure Wendy's next door would have been better..."}
{"text":"When you've been traveling since 3 am, you just want to stop for a big breakfast and coffee. Luckily, my gate was a mere 30 second walk from Matt's, giving me plenty of time to enjoy a \"Matt's big breakfast\" with pancakes, eggs, bacon, and sausage. The bacon here is peppered, thick, and delicious. The rest of the breakfast measured up just as well. They also have a full bar in case you aren't traveling at breakfast time and have other menu items as well. Overall, I'm pleased that this was an option in my terminal."}
{"text":"Easy 5 stars from me.  I travel for work a lot and all my AM trips start at Matt's.  The food is fantastic and comes out fast.  Both the steak and eggs and the Belgian waffle are top notch.  Bacon Bloody Mary is best ever in my book, too.  I've been to every major airport in the US and PHX is my fave.  So much good food here.  Sucks that you have to have a ticket to get in."}
{"text":"A bit of a wait but well worth it. Hog and chick breakfast! So so good. Bacon is peppered and AMAZING. And their sourdough toast and homemade preserves! The final treat of this perfect breakfast! And don't forget to get a strawberry honey lemonade to go! Got to try it!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. I would only be adding to a long list of gushing reviews, so I'll be brief.   When you go (and you're planning on going -- right?) ask about the food. So much of what they serve isn't store-bought. It's hand crafted. That toast you get? On fresh baked bread. The bacon? From a special local butcher. The jam to spread on your toast? Homemade. And delicious.   Service with a smile.   Great new (larger) digs.   Go early. This place is POPULAR for a reason."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot ! first time here... Food tasted great and they served great portions! will be coming  back here for the waffle, herb potatoes and wheat bread !"}
{"text":"Was in town for a training event and had to check this place out! Saw it on Triple D and it was as advertised if not better! The service was fantastic (all the girls were very attentive and friendly) and the food was amazing! Probably one of the best waffles I've ever had anywhere! The home fries, toast, and bacon was top notch!  I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in town! If you haven't been, you gotta check it out!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place because of all the reviews. Food was ok, way overrated. Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and absolutely loved it! I had the chop and chick and it was amazing, loved the toast. Food is fresh and service is friendly, the line was out the door, but so worth the wait. Prices were great, had an awesome experience. We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I ordered an omelette & potatoes. The entire plate was swimming in grease. The meal was crazy greasy - not impressed. The service was as good as can be expected during the holiday rush travel hour. If this is my only choice in concourse B I'll opt for Wendy's next time."}
{"text":"I think its not what its all hyped up to be, and its overpriced probably due to location."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was pretty miserable. Server seemed annoyed that we were there. We had some questions because it was our first time and it was like pulling teeth to get an answer. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast I've had. Long wait, over an hour on a sunday but all was amazing. Saw it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and it still impressed.  Got the prime flank steak with over easy eggs, sourdough, hashbrowns, and coffee.  Flank steak was fat, juicy, and had a great pink to it. Kind of tough crust but definately impressive for a breakfast place. Eggs were good and cooked good too. Homeade blueberry preserves were amazing and I put them on everything. Bread was nice but the best was the hashbrowns. Best hashbrowns I have had to date. Crispy outside but so soft and buttery inside. Flawless texture and flavor. You MUST try these, you won't regret it. Waiter said to try cheddar cheese on them the next time and I will definately be back and can't wait to try it.   Definately best breakfast and you have to go here if your in the area."}
{"text":"Ok, they've got a wait line.  Consider the alternative then happily proceed 'cause they got it going on!  We were seated in under 5 mins (yes, the hard stool at the counter is fine--its a dive).  My 5 Spot sandwich was spot-on and did not need any help from the hot sauce which was offered.  The best part of the meal was the local bread they use--perfect.  My wife ordered the special (scrambled eggs with cheese, chorizo and jalapeños with home fries.  She thought the potatoes were off the chain, but the scramble was overtaken by the heat.  The service was excellent, no one seemed frazzled, and the placed hummed along joyfully--it was packed, too.  Next time in PHX we'll go back for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying Matt's for a while, and finally had an excuse to grab a Sonrisa Burrito on a quick layover in Phoenix.  Oh well.  Service was somewhat slow - it was after 8pm and one person was working the register and running orders, as far as I could tell, so she would disappear for a few minutes at a time.  The burrito? Big soft flour tortilla. I got sausage, and the sausage was okay, nothing special. The eggs were dry and scant, and the potatoes needed to be in smaller chunks. Flavor was just missing, and the salsa was unimpressive. Overall, I'm glad I tried it, because now I know not to bother. It's probably better if you get a plate with bacon or something baked, judging by the crowds - I just hope that the disappointing burrito was not representative as I like their farm-to-table concept."}
{"text":"There are things I love about this place and things I didn't.   Loves: concept, (quality ingredients and food), local sourcing, unique sausage flavors, tasty, real maple syrup, real butter  Not loves: seating, not a fan of uber close quarters. If I can reach the table next to me and steal a bite, then for their sake, I'm too close. Loud, cramped, limited menu, long wait time  I do really like this place. They had raw sugar in a sugar dispenser (win) a special of the day (that was not just a discounted version of something already oh the menu) and the food had great taste. Yes taste. HOWEVER, unless you appreciate quality, you will find this place disappointing.  Real maple syrup is not anywhere near the same as Mrs Butterworth. Real butter does not taste like the stuff dispensed onto your movie popcorn. Well you get my point.   I will be back for breakfast another day."}
{"text":"Small Menu and I feel they rush you to eat and leave. Great for sunday morning breakfast but that may be about it.  ............but the canadian bacon is on point"}
{"text":"Super cool inside and the food was really really good. Their bacon is unlike any other bacon I have had. So you must get that whether you get that on the side or your actual meal. I had the hog and chick with bacon. Go go go!"}
{"text":"Good service. Really good food. I got The Five Spot and my husband got the waffle. Both were delicious. Everything tasted clean (not heavy, greasy or processed). The honey lemonade is really tasty The place isn't very big. It was packed with people but they run it well. Decor is cute, sort of an urban farmhouse.  I would recommend and come again."}
{"text":"Griddlecakes and bacon were fabulous.  As others have said expect a wait.  The place is TINY.  Servers were really nice.  I had griddlecakes, bacon and a diet RC and with tip it was $16.  Portions were generous and I was only able to eat one pancake.  Another side note is it's so tiny your wait is outside... Consider the weather.  There is no shade.  I thought it was worth it but I am not sure I'd wait again."}
{"text":"Really Really good! My daughter had the waffle with Bacon and she couldn't stop raving about it. I got the special with chili strip, ham and egg with home fries. The home fries were delicious with fresh rosemary. Will be coming back to try there dinner."}
{"text":"First time checking it out.  Service was friendly and quick.. Wish I could have given more stars but the food wasn't much to write home about.  I didn't have time to alert my server of my disappointment as I needed a quick bite. Was able to pick apart bits I wanted. I paid extra for sausage, and mushrooms... Come to find out, mushrooms are from can?? Why? Never seen so much grease and water pool up on an omlet.  Best part was the side of sourdough bread!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! I found it on DDD and wanted to give it a shot since Guy Fieri usually hits the mark. I went here for my ASU graduation breakfast with my Mom and boyfriend and we all were beyond satisfied. The waffle is wonderful with a touch of vanilla, the bacon I hear is heart-achingly good, the omelettes are savory and hearty plus the bread and homemade jam is just outrageously good! We went here again today because, why resist?"}
{"text":"I got there at 1 on a Sunday and waited for about an hour to get seated. The place is really small so I'm sure there is always a wait. No bathroom.   Food was great. Everything was really fresh. I think there were 5 things to chose from and the one thing I really wanted ran out as I ordered. Majorly bummed.   I would love to come back but seriously am dreading the wait!"}
{"text":"Most attentive serve. And, solid menu for breakfast. The portions aren't too big, despite the name, so order as you would at a diner. Those darn breakfast potatoes are addictive! They also cater to gluten free, just ask what you can eat on the menu."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went to matts this morning after seeing the new location on yelp.  We sat at the counter.  Friendly hellos when we arrived but the service disappeared after that even though there were quite a few people working behind the counter.  We never saw our server again after he took out order, had to ask for coffee and water refills.  Good was average.  I ordered the skinny which was described as the eggs with a small salad on the side.  It was quite the opposite.  A small potion of eggs and a huge salad but quite tasty.  My husband got the griddle cakes which were average but disappointed they didn't come  with bacon or sausage side.   The waffle does so why not the griddle cakes?   The manager came over and asked how we liked our bfast.  I mentioned it to him and he made light of it and redirected the conversation.  He was very friendly. Put $ on the counter to pay our bill and it sat there for 15 minutes before anyone asked if we were waiting to pay our bill.  Hoping a few things improve if we go there again"}
{"text":"I really don't think I could ask for more in a breakfast.  This place is hopping, but if you're dining alone, they'll do their best to scoot you into the bar amongst the other solo travelers.  I ordered chicks and something: two eggs, hash or home fries, sausage or bacon, and your choice of yum-yum bread with homemade preserves.  I took mine: poached, hashed, patties, and wheat with extra butter and the strawberry preserve.     Staff was attentive, I didn't feel rushed in spite of the congregating line in the courtyard, and the food came fast.  Lots of happy people and smiles.  If I could change just one thing...the coffee is a bit weak for my tastebuds and they make their iced coffee by pouring hot coffee over ice (no-thank-you!).  And if I could change two things, I would recommend that the hashbrowns be cold water washed before frying - this allows them to crisp and prevent that gooey middle that mine came with.  Other then that: bliss."}
{"text":"\"What is this? A restaurant for ants? I don't want to hear any excuses! The building has to be at least... Three times bigger than this!\"  On a more serious note, this is a teeny, tiny restaurant - so small that the first action of order is to write your name on a notepad that is waiting on a small table outside the entrance. Then expect to wait outside until there is space inside, because there is simply no space to stand and wait inside. But when you do manage to stick a foot in the door, Matt's Big Breakfast invites you in to a cheery, diner-esque environment but with fresh flowers on the table and nicer than average cutlery to boot. Like the establishment, the menu is small. We ordered the Salami Scramble and the Chop & Chick.  SALAMI SCRAMBLE Though I can always appreciate a bacon and eggs type breakfast, the peppery punch of the salami scramble was a nice change from the classic. Of course breakfast isn't breakfast without some made-from-scratch hash browns that were crispy but not too oily. I generally like my browns a little less fried, but I still enjoyed these taters nonetheless.  CHOP & CHICK The pork chop was expertly seasoned which was right up my alley, because huge hunks of just meat just doesn't hit the spot. Huge hunks of meat with lots o' spices though? Oh yes.  All in all, a nice experience at this charming little restaurant. I would definitely visit when I want some good ol' meat and potatoes for breakfast."}
{"text":"Here in town for the wildcard baseball game tonight. Hotel recommended this restaurant for breakfast. They were right, this is a fantastic breakfast. Sourdough toast excellent, ham steak was excellent, hashbrowns are among the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"It was cold for a Phoenix morning (upper 30s over-night) and I stood outside the hospital splashed in sunlight, surrounded by palm-trees and (oddly) shivering despite my wool army-drab button-down and $3 coffee. The doctor's visit went well and my spirits were high. Surgery was not an option. For now.  A few minutes later, my host arrived in a green VW Rabbit. I love the new rabbits. She needed to get some work accomplished and I needed to address some email. A few (Phoenix) minutes later, we arrived at the coffee-shop. I ordered a mug of coffee and picked up a business card. Lux? That sounds familiar... Oh my goodness! LUX! I shot their first cover on top of the Smithfield at 5.30 on a Sunday morning in 2007 and the magazine was named after the coffee-shop in Phoenix where Mark and Cindy birthed the idea.  The world is tiny.  ---  \"My work is done. You wanna get breakfast?\"  \"Do you even have to ask? What was that place you told me about before I left Philadelphia?\"  \"Matt's. But there's another place I thought of that you might like as well.\"  \"Oh, yeah? What's that?\"  \"The Welcome Diner.\"  \"Lemme find it on Yelp and I'll think about it.\"  \"Okay.\"  \"This is hard. I can't decide. Let's just go to Matt's. I'll do the Welcome in the Spring when I come back.\"  ---  The West is a unique place. The cities are different - spread out. The architecture is different, too. I can't describe it. It just feels like it belongs here in the desert. Form over function. Matt's fits in just this way. It's tiny inside and everything's painted white. A few photographs in white mats with white frames take up the rest of the wall space. The small bar occupies a quarter of the main dining area and four diner-orange tables decorated with desert plants take up the rest of the crowded and intimate space which is by now teeming with locals who're there to gather a late morning brunch.  There were two specials that morning and once our server mentioned the first, I couldn't remember anything else, but I told her that I needed some more time so that I could neatly arrange my table for a shot of the menu. When she came back I ordered the three-egg scramble with red peppers, spicy sausage (all their pork comes from Iowa!) and provolone cheese. A side of shredded hash-browns accompanied this beautiful breakfast feast.  For a joint that stays as busy as it does, the prices are fantastic. (I think everything's cheaper in Phoenix). Before tip, my tab was right around $12 and for the quality and quantity of food that I received in one of Phoenix's most popular spots, I had no complaints.  When I make a return visit to the Valley of the Sun in April, I'll be sure to make myself an out-of-town-regular at this wonderful little place.  ...And maybe next time I'll run into Nate Ruess."}
{"text":"Pros: food is great! Servers are wonderful and pleasant. Cozy environment.  Cons: The host! Upon getting called for our table, while talking on his phone, he just pointed to our table across the room and had us sit ourselves. After 5 minutes, while we are placing our orders, he proceeded to yell out our name across three tables and said that he called \"Melissa\" and not \"Marisa\" and just stared at us. Not sure if he was expecting an apology or just wanted us to leave! Very unprofessional and low class."}
{"text":"I love Matt's Big Breakfast downtown, but this was a huuuuge disappointment. HUGE. I ordered an egg salad sandwich (which I have had before at the one downtown), and it was just awful. There was literally NO egg salad in this sandwich. The two slices of bread on the outside where so unnecessarily THICK. I took off one of the slices in attempt to actually taste the measly amount of egg salad that was on my sandwich, but even then, the other half of bread was so rubbery i couldn't tear it with my teeth! I was in awe. Even the guy sitting next to me said something about it. Like \"wow that's a lot of bread.\"   Don't get me wrong, their breakfast is fantastic at Matt's downtown! And maybe even good at the airport as well. But I have had their egg salad before and it was nothing like that.  I almost complained to my server it was so bad. Almost. I can't believe I spent money on like a tablespoon of egg salad. I never ever complain about food, I usually just don't ever return if I don't like it. But this sandwich was so pathetic I actually wanted my money back. Of course I'm so passive I ended up not saying anything. Was just kind of hoping my server could tell by the fact that I barely ate any of it. I should have complained and I regret not doing so. I just hate to. But this was so bad. Won't ever go here again.   I still kind of want my money back. :( Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"The food was so delicious. Servers came by a bit too much, so it was slightly overwhelming."}
{"text":"After reading all the \"best\" breakfast reviews about this place we were excited to try it out. It was super busy when we arrived which is usually a good sign. It took about 10 minutes to get out order taken once we sat down and then another 10 to get our drinks. When the food came it wasn't even hot. I had to actually get up and get my own hot sauce because it wasn't offered or did our waitress even return to ask how the food was. They seem to be trying too hard to be trendy. They need to focus more on customer service and hot food than being cool."}
{"text":"Wow great breakfast spot. My friends recommended going after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on the food network and we were not disappointed. Being the norcal gal I am I called and asked if the line was hella long... the gal on the phone mentioned that around 12:30-1pm the line calms down. We got there and were seated immediately. Bonus points for having ice cold water outside too. This place was perfect for recovering after the previous nights drink fest. I had the Five Spot with hash browns and it was amazing. My entire group agreed I picked the best thing off the menu. When I'm back in Phoenix I will be back for the Five Spot again.."}
{"text":"Great food...I recommend the waffles with bacon and hash browns....amazing strawberry lemonade. Went on a saturday early afternoon and only had maybe a 5 minute wait...def going again"}
{"text":"Okay so there was a wait to get into this place but damn if it isn't worth it!  Omg! Amazing homemade food.. The bread is homemade, the eggs are free range, and the bacon is nice and thick! I'm in love! Definitely coming back to this place.. They serve a big enough portion to fill you up and finish it all!"}
{"text":"The food is great! Matts has always been my favorite. This location however, first time here and do not like. It's always frustrating when you feel like you are invisible. I was sitting across from my husband. Not once was I approached or talked to. When they came to get our drink my husband had just parked the truck and came to sit down and they asked him! For food same thing. When management came by to check on us, same thing checked on him! The chick with the check same thing! Heck I even paid for the meal they will thanked him! Wth! I was shocked and confirmed I am not going back."}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday around 10:30 and didn't expect a long wait... surprise, surprise, we waited an hour. Other than the wait (which was expected) the food was delicious. Everyone working at Matt's were friendly (they all say goodbye to you as you leave). I definently recommend getting the bacon as a side if it does not come as part of your meal. If you can't stand the heat, order carryout or show up later (at 11:30 there was maybe a 15 minute wait)."}
{"text":"Oh that pork chop is going to haunt my dreams.    I have never had such an a,a zingy flavored pork chop.   The hash browns were tasty and crisp.  We also had eggs, which were cooked perfectly...sunny side up and scrambled.   The special was biscuits and gravy, they were amazing.   The gravy had a slight spice and the biscuits were creamy and flaky.   It was well worth the 1:2 hour wait."}
{"text":"Sleep is really the time machine to breakfast and Matt's is a great spot to take your sleepy head for breakfast. I'm a fan of the Phoenix location but this one is perfect for a bike ride along Tempe Town Lake and nestled among the beauty of Marina Heights. Once inside, it's sleek and modern with colorful chalk drawings displaying. I like the short menu so you aren't overloaded on those hangover mornings. There are a variety of specials each day of the week but I stuck to the waffles....something about those airy pillows of carb goodness had me. If the freshly brewed STRONG coffee from the Roastery of Cave Creek doesn't perk you up, the bellini and margarita are pretty delish good eye openers. Just a note, there's few 5 tops (3 to be exact) so not the easiest to accommodate large parties. You MUST have all people present to be seated. Or if you can squeeze in, sit at the bar and gab with a few Sun Devils. The waiting area is spacious on the outdoor patio that you can stalk the diners to hurry and finish up! Parking is pretty easy and they will validate for the garage. And if you've overindulged, just walk steps to the gym across the yard or take a quick run around the lake."}
{"text":"Usually like this place husband loves their Steak and Eggs disappointed it's only served on Sundays (( He had Pork chop and Eggs instead very small chop ,used to come with 2 now it's only one but it was dry anyway Didn't care for it all. The only thing good was the coffee. We felt very rushed to get out so they could set more people mind you nobody was waiting as yet we got in and out early."}
{"text":"Food is always great, always a wait and yes, sometimes is loud. But, if you want great food, you have to endure small inconveniences"}
{"text":"It's so great that I don't have to go to the downtown location while here on business. Been coming to Matt's for years. This newish Tempe location is great. Large. Bright and neat ASU. Staff was super friendly too. I'm pretty simple when it comes to breakfast so I opted for the two egg breakfast with their incredible bacon. What's even more enjoyable is their thick sliced sourdough toast. The hash browns are also delicious. But let me get back to the bacon. Thick cut. Peppered. Perfectly cooked crisp with an outstanding smoky flavor. And while you may be tempted to get Starbucks across the way, their coffee is also flavorful. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna need a nap after this in this hot weather but it's worth it. Vince was a great guy too. Breakfast is also served all day. Parking in the Marina Center. Free wifi. Just happy that there wasn't a wait!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE EVER. Here is the story of our attempt to dine at this restaurant:  We come around 9:40 am and we put our name on the waiting list. There is a large amount of people waiting outside and I ask the man at the front counter if he knew how long the wait is. His reply: \"Yup.\" Silence. I looked at him puzzled and he said \"All your question stated was if I knew the wait time.\" I figured this was his idea of humor and let it slide. I then said \"How long approximately is the wait?\" His reply: \"We don't give wait times, but if I had to guess, maybe 30 minutes?\"   So the boyfriend, a bit bewildered, put our name down and decide to get coffee around the corner at Song Bird Cafe (awesome place, good coffee and FRIENDLY staff, something Matt's Big Breakfast could learn a thing or two from.) We wait about 30 minutes and decide to call the restaurant to make sure they have not called our name. The same man we had originally spoken to answered and when we explained we had gotten coffee around the corner and were just wondering if our names had been called he said, \"I don't know, I gotta go.\" And then he hung up.   So by this time we are very annoyed and walk over. I walk inside and go up to the same man and AGAIN ask if our name has been called and he looks at me and says: \"I don't know, I don't have the list.\" I get upset and tell him he has been rude to us and the restaurant is very unorganized and I didn't appreciate being hung up on minutes earlier. His response? Not an \"I'm sorry\" not a \"what can I do?\" No, his response: \"umm, it didn't happen like that I never hung up on you!\" The man had the nerve to argue with a customer! The whole time we were very polite and not demanding. Needless to say, we took our business elsewhere and went to Postino's and had a lovely brunch.  I have A LOT of family and friends in the area (whom I was visiting) and I have told them all NEVER to come to this place. This place has the attitude that they are too good to even have customer service or even be decent and polite to people. They don't deserve my business and they don't deserve anyone's business until they can change their awful ways. I lived in San Francisco for 7 years and now live in San Diego with amazing food and restaurants; I am sure Matt's Big Breakfast doesn't hold a candle to anything in SF or SD and no restaurant in the former category has ever treated me the way the man did at Matt's Big Breakfast. Save your money and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went to this spot a while ago and I have been meaning to post.  The food was delicious and very fresh, the service was great as well.  It's your usual few suspects in the menu but all in all, very fresh and good taste."}
{"text":"We were invited to eat here at the request of one of my relatives visiting the Phoenix area.  I have seen the establishment on TV and have heard of it's reputation from the media, but, even living in the area for many years, I never found the necessity to travel  downtown  to try the food.  We arrived at about 10 AM on a cool December morning and upon arriving we we noted that the area outside the restaurant was surrounded by potential patrons.  After putting our name on the list for a table we patiently waited fr 40 minutes for a table. With a wait like this I expected something over the top in a breakfast meal.  When we obtained our table it was in a small room with 2 refrigerators a prep table and cleaning sink.  Not much for ambiance, but, I needed to see the food and the presentation.  I ordered the waffle special and others ordered egg meals. I was somewhat amazed at the small serving size of the waffle which was about 6 inches in diameter.  The side was 2 slices of bacon.  The egg dishes were nothing out of the ordinary and were similar to what I cook up in my kitchen. Prices were average for a breakfast establishment.  Serves was a shining star for the establishment.  Our staff was great once we got into the restaurant.   Bottom line...This is a tourist destination made popular by a media celebrity.  As a local, I would not make the trip again to this place. in their defense, they have other locations in the area and I have not visited those to determine if the quality of food was any different.    If in the area and you want to make  the trek to downtown Phoenix and say you've been there, enjoy."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Matt's breakfast we parked right up front and our parking meter had enough time on it we didn't have to pay any! Then we walk in and got seated immediately it was really cute inside, comfy cozy and friendly! The waitress we had was great and very quick and attentive! We ordered and our food came out so fast and it was all perfect and tasted amazing we definitely recommend giving them a try for a breakfast or brunch!!"}
{"text":"Great food, large portions. The lemonade is very good (star berry, as well as blueberry)."}
{"text":"Some of the staff at this location is lame as f... the food is trash. I'd recommend the downtown location if you're looking to get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I don't mind lay overs or delays because i know I've got a great crispy waffle and Honey Lemonade waiting for me here!  The bacon is too thick for my liking, but they will sub with 3 links of yummy sausage."}
{"text":"How did anyone give this place a score lower than a 5?? You must hate breakfast. The quality of the food is equal to any in the US."}
{"text":"Well going against the grain for sure but, this is one really over-rated joint. Not even worth the wait. I came here like at least 8 others that were waiting out front because we saw Matt's on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on TV so it was one of those \"Hey that my town, We gotta go!\" I ordered one of the plates I saw on the show, the Chop and Chick, a large succulent boneless pork chop, 3 perfectly cooked eggs, nice crispy brown hash browns, thick hand sliced toast,  Whats not to like right,? Well waiting on the sidewalk out front at Matt's for 1.5hrs to finally get into Breakfast Nirvana, order up and here you go  1 thin 25% bone pork chop over cooked and dry. Ever compare a Big Mac in an ad to the one you get in a box and you'll see my point here. 3 eggs still slimy and runny, medium eggs means medium 1 huge helping of hash browns that I could have cooked the next 6 orders of eggs with the grease they wallowed in. Sourdough Toast, 4 stars perfect, excellent. So not all bad, just way over rated, and the following day a really great breakfast at a real local spot Big Daddy's up on Cave Creek Rd and Peoria, excellent in every way and we had never been there for breakfast before but we will be back, Matt's not a chance."}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed! I've never had an actual \"real meal\" in an airport before. I meant to take a picture of my plate, but I was halfway done with it when I thought about it. This is good, honest food. I just got off a plane from a super early flight and was pretty hungry. I ordered 2 eggs over-easy (which were expertly cooked), rosemary home fries, thick-cut bacon, and really thick rye toast with fresh squeezed OJ. The toast was too thick for my liking because i like to use it to sop up the yolk, but it was accompanied by raspb preserves. left full and walking a little slower. They make everything to order, so don't stop if you're about to jump on a plane, but it's worth the stop if you have the time. The OJ was $5 which seemed pricey to me for what it was. The meal was about $15, but you certainly pay for convenience when in an airport and I didn't have a problem with the price when considering the meal."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite breakfast joint in Phoenix. I love the food so much and the service is great. Also, their coffee is delicious and they are constantly refilling you. Praise. If you want to be seated early, make sure you go early in the AM. Especially on Sunday's, they're normally packed so be there by 8am. Best kn the menu, to me, is the Five Spot, however their pancakes and waffles are KILLER!! Extremely fluffy and made from scratch. You seriously can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Everything is delicious."}
{"text":"The menu is limited but the food was good. There were only a couple of healthy options so I chose the oatmeal with a side of bacon. Both were good. The person I was meeting said the pancakes were great, so good he ordered an extra cake. Service was good as well.  I'd be willing to try it again for lunch or when I didn't want to eat healthy."}
{"text":"Daniel was our counter waiter. Jason is the general manager. WOW! Great service, Food, and FUN! The picture says it all. We ate everything. Then we rolled to the car.  We had two eggs over easy cooked perfectly with hash browns thick yummy bacon (three pieces) and wheat toast. With a single pancake for the home made hot maple syrup. Oh my! Coffee was smooth and bold.  Great place."}
{"text":"Cool Spot. I arrived in Arizona that morning and my dad said we had to try this Triple D (the food network) rated spot.   Good thing we went when we did we waited about 10 minutes, but when we left the wait seemed to be 30+!  Anyway, the service was very good, my dad started asking the waitress questions and this is usually when I get a little embarrassed, however she knew her shit and my dad liked her responses.  Home made juice was great, coffee was good hot and strong.  The food here is VERY BASIC, but they use the best possible ingredients.  The bread for example that came with my omelet was artisan shit, so good with nuts and seeds....mmmmmmm and the jam although may not have been homemade it was the expensive stuff :)  I will definitly be back if I am ever in the hood!"}
{"text":"Got off the airplane, did a quick Yelp search for breakfast and found Matt's. What a great find- this place is legit! The food is high quality and tasty. I had the Classic Eggs Benedict special- my favorite breakfast dish, and it was perfection. My companions had the breakfast sandwich and the Skinny. They enjoyed theirs just as much as me. I can't understand how this place could be rated less than 5 stars. Don't be a hater because you have to wait 25 minutes for a seat- it is worth it! I will also say it is clean and has good service."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of breakfast food.  But I got breakfast here just for you~~  :P  So I can see why a lot of reviewers said to go for the home fries.  The hash browns looked fine, perfectly golden on the top, exactly the way I prefer it.  However, I'm pretty sure there weren't the additional flavorings like the rosemary and onions in that~!  The home fries had great flavor AND they cooked crispy on at least one of the sides of each piece.  Absolutely one of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had.  I got the special of the day which was 3 eggs scrambled with ham off the bone, anaheim chili peppers, and cheese with a side of tortilla.  It was delicious.  Good char on the tortilla too.  It was very slightly underdone, but I actually prefer that over the risk of overdone eggs.  I guess the one thing that detracted from the place was the limited menu.  They don't really serve any alcoholic beverages (which is actually a bit refreshing), and some common breakfast items are not on the menu (ie biscuits and gravy, french toast).  But hey, if I can pick anything off their menu and it will be equally delicious, I would always come back!"}
{"text":"We had a great time yesterday on a rainy (yes rainy) Sunday morning.  We arrived around ten-thirty and the place was packed. There must have been two dozen ahead of us waiting in line.  So, after a few minutes we decide to sit at the counter, since it was mostly empty.  Our waitress was Briann, who set us up with some coffee almost as we sat down.  Great start!  We ordered the waffles with thick-cut pepper bacon with a couple of spicy sausage patties and some eggs, hashbrowns and bacon.  Everything was very good and as we came to the end of our meal, we noticed the Hostess and told her to take our name off the list for a table.  LOL!  Turns out the list was for the counter as well. D'oh!  Then why were all the seats empty?  Anyway, the rains let up and we were off to the Phoenix Art Museum.  Great way to start a Sunday morning. Our total was a fair $26.50 including taxes, but before gratuities.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Matt's Big Breakfast at the airport once before but this place has really stepped up their game! The management was on point, making sure we were happy and got our food promptly. I had a custom-made omelet and was not disappointed. Everything from the peppers, eggs, bacon and coffee grounds are all locally sourced and as fresh as it gets. The icing on the cake for me was the bacon, one of the thickest cuts I've ever received at a restaurant and the flavor was out of this world. Highly recommend trying this place out, no doubt you'll be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich was pretty tasty and a pretty good size for 10 bucks. DON'T get the $3+ coleslaw instead of kettle chips unless you just want thick sliced cabbage drenched in creamy dressing. Should've gotten fries instead!"}
{"text":"Scrambled eggs & Salami. Very good, The hash browns & jam were superb"}
{"text":"My omelet was average and my girlfriend's eggs were way too oily. The room is cramped and very loud. Not worth the long wait time."}
{"text":"If you want anything more than the most basic breakfast don't come here. No whip cream for a waffle. Nothing fancier than butter. Might as well stay home and make you're own breakfast. Waste of money."}
{"text":"I remember the bacon, and the potatoes the most, we had to wait to get a table but it was very good."}
{"text":"New location is cleaner and has more seating.  But of course still a wait no matter when you try and go.  Waited 40 minutes for table for 2.  People always polite and food of course is fresh and worth the wait.  I'll be back and stand outside for a good breakfast,  if people wait weeks for a new phone or concert tickets,  there will always be people willing to wait up to an hour or so for a fresh good meal.  Prices are right average $5-$15.  Where $5 is a bowl of cereal and $15 is steak and eggs.  Note they do not serve alcohol and while the rear parking is free,  it is limited.  Also phoenix meter parking now charges on weekends.  There is an older grey haired lady riding around with a bad attitude and always unforgiving..."}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered the steel oats.  Nothing great about it. Small oats that immediately tuned watery.  Had like 3 waitresses take our order. After, no one else came back to check on us. On the other hand, my mom liked her Friday special. She was full. I ate the rest of her plate.  Kinda disappointed in my first visit.  I heard great things about this place.  I saw that Monday special was Juevos Rancheros.  I will have to try that. Also will have to try the freshly squeezed lemonade.  My mom mentioned that she enjoyed the jam and toast."}
{"text":"4 stars for food, 3 stars for service.  Food was traditional breakfast fare, good sized portions and homemade strawberry preserves on thick cut wheat toast was delicious! Took a few minutes to get served our beverage, I ordered half caf coffee, but when refilled wasn't asked what it was, just auto refilled with full strength.  While busy, a moment to check in with the customer would have been appreciated."}
{"text":"So after many years if wanting to Dine at Matt's Big Breakfast today was the day.  I have read the rave reviews and was excited but that did not last long.  The first disappointment was they moved up the street and gone is the diner feel I so wanted.  The wait was long, about 45 minutes on a Thursday late morning but we were finally seated and the immediate feel was less diner and more industrial.  The server was quick to the table with water and a quick rundown of the daily special.  My partner and I looked over the very brief and very over priced menu and we decided on the breakfast special and a lunch sandwich, it was 11:15 so we thought we would try some lunch.  Ugh....after waiting over 30 minutes we got up to leave, I was hungry and the staff had now deserted us so we were going to leave.   At this time a woman, I can only assume she was the manager came up and said the food was coming.  We declined.  She said she could box the food to go, we declined.  She then said the wait was our fault, you see we ordered lunch.  So sad, I won't be back i will stay a loyal customer of Joes Diner were the food is appropriately priced, the service is great and the staff does not blame the guest for ordering lunch."}
{"text":"Great hangover cure, hipster type of feel with unfinished floors. Food is good"}
{"text":"I went in last week for the first time. I must say, the food at this location is hearty and the wait is short. I ordered an omelet and home fries and they were both delicious. If you're craving an All-American breakfast, you cannot go wrong here. The bacon strips are thick yet crispy so I recommend getting them if they aren't already included in your order. Though the prices are a bit more than affordable, it's well worth it and I plan to return here often."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Matt's Big Breakfast.  I was prepared to wait a bit so didn't really mind that part, but they do need more seats in the shade.    The menu at Matt's is somewhat limited.  While I like to keep things simple and can easily get overwhelmed by those menus with zillions of options, I was annoyed by the 'no substitutions' policy.  There was a daily special posted on the board that had jalapenos and sausage.  I don't eat sausage, so I asked if I could get a vegetable instead.  The answer was no.  Okay fine.  Could they add jalapeno to one of the dishes that didn't come with sausage?  No.  Ugh.  I ended up ordering the cheese omelet and paying $1 each for onion and red peppers.    I couldn't get enough of the hash browns, although unfortunately they were probably loaded with butter.  Good thing I went to kickboxing that day.  Overall this is a cute little restaurant with great food.  Just be prepared to wait and plan on your food being made Matt's way, not your way."}
{"text":"Well here we are starving after the morning shopping at the VNSA book sale at the fair grounds.  This my first time here, my husband has has lunch here and said the food is good.  So we put our names on the waiting list and waited about 15 minutes.  When we were finally called to be seated the host stood at the door and pointed across the room to show us our table.   First of all this place is small, very crowed and the noise level is very loud. Not the kind of place to come to if you have a headache. Our waitress came to get our drink order which was good, but not great my bottom was not even on the chair yet. Not good because I wasn't sure if I wanted breakfast or lunch.  The food was good, but I was sitting staring at the bathroom which is the table I hate to sit at.  Not sure I would go back considering there are so many other places in the valley with better atomisphere, better food and they have enough tables that you're not staring at the bathroom."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! The food is big and yummy in this tiny little restaurant! The owner was there and was very nice!! The waffle was great and the bacon was awesome!! I will come back the next time I'm in phoenix!"}
{"text":"I heard this place was on one of the Food Network shows and I was expecting a busy place that doesn't live up to the hype - not the case at all.  I got there shortly after they opened, I think it was around 6:30 in the morning, walked over from the Sheraton, sat at the counter, friendly service, delicious breakfast.  Locally sourced good quality ingredients make simple foods very good.  I had the special, some sort of egg scramble with local sausage and jalapenos - yum!!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast!  I've been here four times while waiting for my connecting flights and have always ordered the Matt's Biggest Breakfast - 2 sausage patties, 2 strips of thick-cut bacon, eggs, potatoes and a pancake.  Wow, this meal is solid!  Everything is flavorful and fresh!  They have real maple syrup and ketchup without high fructose corn syrup - another plus!  My husband has ventured to try other menu items and they never disappoint.  The service has always been great and fast, which is needed, especially in an airport.  I highly recommend a stop here if you happen to find yourself at the Phoenix airport - Gate B!"}
{"text":"When I first started going to Matt's, 7 years ago, this place was amazing and well worth the wait! Unfortunately, the food is nowhere near as good as it used to be. They overcharge on everything and the service is not great either. It's really disappointing."}
{"text":"This place was on the DD&D places my family wanted to go while in town, I joined them since I'd heard plenty about it but never gone.  The place is small, so yes there is going to be a wait.  You chose to eat there knowing this so complaining about the wait is pretty ridiculous.  That said, I'm not sure if I'd attempt coming here on a weekend, but during the workweek it was fine, the wait was maybe 20-30 minutes.  The food was great, the coffee was strong.  My only complaint is with more than one person checking on our table we asked for water from them 2-3 times and I don't think they ever came back with it.  Wasn't that big of a deal but seemed like it wasn't that hard since they were checking on us about every 2 minutes (got the feeling of being rushed through our meal, but maybe that is their way of keeping the flow of folks coming in and out)."}
{"text":"It's ok, the breakfast is solid but I would like a little more variety especially for a place that people really love."}
{"text":"I so wanted to sooo looovvveee this place and while it was good I wasn't oh so impressed.....we waited awhile, it was Saturday morning, once we finally sat down we were greeted quickly but after that it went down hill....my boyfriend got his food 10 min ,before I did...the people next to us who sat down 15 min after us got their food before me...the waffle was ok...nothing special. I will try it again and hope for the best..."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite/ go-to breakfast spots! Great service, everything on the menu tastes amazing, and I love the location/aesthetic of the restaurant! And, on top of all that, it's super affordable. A lot of breakfast places in Tempe are overpriced, in my opinion. Anytime someone visits me, this is always the first place I recommend.   I've had the steak and eggs, biscuit and sausage gravy, the hog and chick, and the salami scramble-- all of which tastes amazing. Their sourdough bread is unlike any sourdough I've tried before and it's really good, their hash browns and home fries are also yummy as well. Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything you choose lol. After you've stuffed yourself, you can walk your food baby off around Tempe Town Lake!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to our wonderful waiter Michael, My fellow traveling companions and I had a great time. We had awesome food, that was well cooked and the honey lemonade tea was amazing. Thank you for your fun filled service, in the words of Michael \"A smile makes all the difference, and it's free.\" Just what we needed this morning."}
{"text":"The menu is short and simple, but you will find that the food is anything but. Everything is organic and natural, which I'll admit does not mean much to me, but the TASTE is what matters. You have large servings, juicy and grass fed meat, cheesy filling eggs, and Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"The breakfast here is pretty good. HUGE portions and solid offerings. The menu doesn't have anything mind-blowing different but everything is very very solid. The wait is a little bit of a turn off though."}
{"text":"One of the better airport food places I've been to.  Thick slices of bacon that you almost need two hands to eat, (exaggeration) and they were delicious.  I also had sausage, 3 eggs, bacon, potatoes and a large pancake for $13.  Liked every bit of my breakfast and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast sausage burrito, spicy, meaty, and hit the spot. Service at the bar was a little slow but good server was very friendly.  Coffee was better then the Starbucks 3 gates down  Tv's at the bar, NHRA on a Sunday morning"}
{"text":"Great food.Quick service. Laid back vibe. Winning in my book! Whether you are visiting for a day or a longer period of time in Phoenix, this place is a must eat for breakfast. Hash browns are amazing!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Phoenix? No, if I could rate negative I would. My first time and I will never go back to any location. The time my party and I went wasn't busy the restaurant was not even half way full. Service felt like we were being rushed to order, 3 different people came to our table to wait on us within 5 mins of being sat, silverware was being slammed while sorting in the dinning room I couldn't even hear my conversation at the table, when our food was being ran out the food runner went to the wrong table twice. After five minutes he brought out 2 of 3 plates to our table. Another five minutes go by and the 3rd plate was not out which was a waffle by the way. How is a pork chop and potatoes done before a waffle? As we waited and stared for them to come and even check or let us know that the rest of the food would be out shortly they just looked at us like nothing. We all had high hopes for this place drove from Chandler to downtown Phoenix for a horrible experience."}
{"text":"The waffles are f'n airy and amazing. Generous portions and quick service. Friendly staff at the counter. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Wow such a beautiful done restaurant! The restaurant looks like a old dinner, but a modern  feel. Food is done so well always comes out hot and yummy! Also where this restaurant sit amongst the large buildings and the fountains is just a serial ."}
{"text":"I know this isn't going to sit well with a lot of Yelpers, but I was markedly underwhelmed by Matt's.  I had high expectations considering the avid reviews (and the feature on the Food Network), but frankly, I was disappointed.  I was expecting quite the wait to be seated considering the popularity of the place (and the line when I got there), but since I was dining alone, I was seated immediately.  Unfortunately, my seat was at a bar along a window that faced the hot Arizona sun.  I had to wear sunglasses while dining.  I started with a cup of coffee.  It was fresh, but not particularly flavorful.  Anyway, that's not really where I'm hung up on this place.  What do you expect for a buck thirty-five?  No, my issue was with my food.  Here's what I ordered: a Salami Scramble (basically scrambled eggs with salami) and a side of bacon.  The Salami Scramble was served with hash browns and toast.  The biggest disappointment of the meal was easily the Salami Scramble.  Having read good things about the entree, and upon recommendation of my server, I was excited to try the scramble.  Unfortunately, the scramble failed to live up to the hype. While the eggs were cooked perfectly (not too rubbery and not too runny), the overall flavor was off-putting.  The salami tasted okay, but in conjunction with the eggs, and the overpowering use of herbs, the final product was less than delicious.  Even after slathering the whole thing in catsup and hot sauce, the herbal and earthy overtones were overpowering.  I had the same problem with the hash browns: they were entirely overpowered with herbs.  I found myself actively trying to pick out the rosemary permeating the potatoes.  As far as the bacon goes, it was undercooked.  I like my bacon relatively crispy, perhaps more than others, but still, this was very chew.  The toast was fine.  Because of how much positive buzz this place has I may try it again - perhaps I was the victim of a rare poorly prepared meal here.  As it stands now, though, I'm less than enthused.  Lay off the herbs - they're best used sparingly.  They're potatoes, not a salad."}
{"text":"If cost isn't an issue then Matt's big breakfast is a good spot to check out. The Biscuits and gravy were very good except for that mint garnish they put on the potatoes mixed with the gravy and the aftertaste wasn't too good lol. But over all I think it was a fun experience, good food, friendly staff, but save up it's costly."}
{"text":"Yummmmm... Such a great breakfast place.  The epitome of comfort food and all of it homemade.  REAL food, big portions and really nice servers.  This is certainly a place that will definitely have a repeat visit from us!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Greasy but good.  The price of the small glass of fresh sqeezed orange juice was silly expensive but it was tasty.  I had an omelet with sauteed mushrooms and onions and cheddar cheese with wheat toast and preserves as well as home fries.  I would eat here again if there was no wait and I was in the area."}
{"text":"Had not been to Matt's in a while. There was no wait. We went around 11 on a weekday and beat the masses.   Got the pesto marinated pork chop and chick. ¡Riquísimo! Over easy egg and hash browns on side with a splash of tapatio made it perfect. Side of sourdough bread with blackberry jam also was delicious. Service, as always, was top notch!"}
{"text":"There were a couple of reviews for Matt's Big Breakfast that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  Two people made the comment that \"Denny's makes a better breakfast\".  That is patently ridiculous.  The only time someone cracks open an egg at Denny's is if you order them sunny side up.  Otherwise, they pour pre-scrambled eggs (as does IHOP) from a bottle.  The other comments I've read are \"there's nothing here that can't be made at home.\"  Completely true, but that could be said of a lot of restaurants.  The whole point is going OUT to eat when you don't want to make food at home.  Frankly, some of the lesser starred reviews would be much different if not for the long waits.  Anyway, I digress...  Like many, I first became aware of MBB after it was featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (DDD, Triple D, 3D, etc.)  It looked good, but nothing terribly special.  Certainly not like some of the places I've seen on DDD, which leave me checking travel websites for flights.  But, I thought, \"If I'm in Phoenix, I'll give this a try.\"    So, I'm in Phoenix and craving breakfast.  I make my way down to Matt's and while there are 6-7 people milling about outside, it's not too bad.  After waiting maybe 30 minutes (downright speedy compared to the wait endured by some other reviewers), my name is called and I enter the tiny eatery.  The menu is pretty sparse, but there are some specials so I opted for one of the items on the chalkboard: egg, spinach, mushroom, smoked gouda scramble with hash browns and toast.  While I wait for my meal, I enjoy some of the very tasty coffee.  My plate arrives, and it is a large serving of food, contradicting the reports of skimpy servings.  As a lover of hash browns, I had to try them first.  Crispy and super buttery, just as I recalled when watching DDD.  The scramble was excellent and you could tell how fresh the ingredients are.  I decided to save my toast and housemade jam as my \"dessert\", so to speak.  I think my only issue was with the hash browns.  They started off so well, but it was a large portion and at the halfway point the richness of the butter started taking its toll.  I soldiered on and finished my plate, but I seriously thought I'd have a heart attack.  Sadly, did not have room for my toast and jam.  If I ever find myself in Phoenix again, I would come back."}
{"text":"Great vibe, HUGE portions. Twilight, my server, was professional and really fun. I had the Cheese Omlet and couldn't finish it was so huge. Recommended."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend after he saw it recommended by Guy Fieri on the food network. It's a true dive; it can only fit about 25 people, your really never going to avoid a long wait and it's nothing special on the inside.  That aside, the food is RIDICULOUS. The butter burger is easily the best burger I've ever had. It's incomparable. I got a side of country fries which were also insanely delicious and tried the waffles which were unmatched in quality. They actually added a slight seasoning to the waffles which give it a nice touch to the sweetness.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We came for breakfast and the food was delicious. The meats are very flavorful. Hash browns were awesome. I would have given it 5 stars, but the wait was about 1 hour. Then again, this is a sign of a great place."}
{"text":"went to matt's for the first time for breakfast.  we are huge breakfast fans.  I ordered griddle cakes and another hungry person ordered the salami scramble with fresh tomatoes and sourdough toast.  the jam with the toast was very good; the egg scramble was hot and not over cooked.  my griddle cakes were subpar; have had far better pancakes at snooze, baja cafe...   iced tea was flavored and not informed of that fact when i ordered it so sent it back. nothing to write home about eating here;  we will continue to try different breakfast cafes and won't be returning to matt's."}
{"text":"Grabbed brunch here with some friends after landing at PHX. First stop on our road trip!  It was quite busy for a Friday morning at like 9am (don't people have work?!) but we were seated within 10 minutes. I ended up ordering the cheese omelet and added bacon. This also came with toast on the side, of which I ordered wheat. Yeah ok, this was literally a big breakfast. My plate was FULL with home fries (seasoned with rosemary yum) and my omelette took up more than half the plate. The pieces of toast were massive, yet the perfect level of toasted. Not crispy, nor soft. Perfection. Everything was delicious. I left feeling satisfied and full. Also, our server was super friendly, and was on top of refilling our coffees, as we were all suffering from sleep deprivation."}
{"text":"We found this place while waiting for our luggage to arrive at PHX. Everyone enjoyed their breakfast choice. The griddle cakes were light and fluffy. The Five Spot is a breakfast sandwich on a deliciously soft roll with eggs, cheese, bacon and onion. It was really good. I had the Huevos Rancheros Verde, it had a slight spicy kick to it. I thought it was pretty good. I'd definitely recommend this place and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great location, cute atmosphere. Staff was super friendly. The food we had was so delicious. I had the Hog & Chick with ham. The ham was super flavorful and my eggs were cooked exactly as I requested. My daughter had the cheese omelette and it was very good. Both plates were good sized portions."}
{"text":"Big Brekfast. Lots of food. Don't be surprised if you can't finish it. A simple 2 eggs, bacon and house potatoes with toast is more than filling.  Loved the fresh squeezed orange juice.  Great service.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Thanks to Guy Fieri of FoodNetwork fame, this place was at the top of my list for a weekend getaway to Phoenix/Scottsdale! My friend and I drove directly from the airport to Matt's, which turned out to be in a rather desolate location but easy enough to find. Our timing was just right because we arrived a little before noon and were seated within minutes.  Since I'd been up since dawn and not had a proper meal, I went all out and ordered the Hog and the Chick (choice of pork product with eggs), plus a side of the pancakes! It was all fantastic--just wish I could have finished it. The bacon was tasty and the griddlecakes were amazing! They had this wonderful texture, substantial but still light, tasted of corn, and stood up to the syrup. I hate when pancakes go all soggy with syrup, but these didn't. They just stayed delicious to the last bite. Yum!  Will definitely go back if I'm ever in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome. Fresh, fast, and tasty. And coming from San Francisco - this meal was a steal.   We came for breakfast on Tuesday and was seated without a wait and food arrived quickly. We ordered the special scramble - grilled pork tenderloin scramble - and the waffle with bacon. The scramble was huge and the hash browns that came with it were so delicious, as everyone else has described. The waffle was light and heavenly! The bacon was seriously thick-cut and a perfect complement.   The staff was super friendly and attentive.  This was definitely a highlight of our trip."}
{"text":"My flight was in another terminal, but I came to the airport early so I could go to Matt's. My last experience was good. This experience was not so good. The sonrisa burrito is nothing to smile about. The garnish on the Bloody Mary was stale."}
{"text":"Was excited to see them join the plaza. Tried the breakfast a few weeks ago, had The Five Spot. Grilled onions on breakfast sandwich is new for me. It's ok, if I had to order it again would definitely so no to it. Today I ordered the Tossed Cobb salad. It was missing the romaine lettuce. I ordered ToGo & when I opened the container I was disappointment. If they ran out, I should have been told& could have ordered something else. I'm hoping it was a fluke & won't happen the next time."}
{"text":"Matt and Ernie are some of the most genuine people I've ever met. Both very hard workers and the food at their restaurant is amazing!!! I love how they give quality ingredients but the food is still very affordable."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot for dine in and take out.  Try the daily special.  The Tempe location is a gem."}
{"text":"A great breakfast place in Phoenix.  I had the chop and chick (pork chop and Eggs) with home fries.  It was a solid breakfast.  It is a relatively small place, I did not have to wait for a counter seat (eating alone) but there was a wait for a table.  The food is worth the wait.  You can tell it is all homemade and freshly prepared.  The servers and staff are very friendly and attentive.  Even with my back to the dining room, eating at the counter looking out the window, they were refilling my coffee mug before it was empty."}
{"text":"I am going to make this review short and sweet..  Great food! I love the hashbrowns! I am big fan of the food!  The negative end of this place... the wait. Its a great place to take out of town guests or an occasional place to drop into every now and then. I don't think any place is worth waiting 45 minutes in the heat."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in the city.  \"Hog and chick\" is my favorite dish."}
{"text":"Great new location. Lots of seating! Counter seats are fun, staff is great. Some familiar faces from the other locations. Love that it's closer to my home."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. That's all I can say.   This place is the kama sutra of flavor for your taste buds."}
{"text":"Came here during breakfast rush on a Sunday. The place was packed and I was worried it would be an hour wait. WE WERE SEATED WITHIN 15 MINUTES! Due to the rush I was also expecting that the service would be slow, but the service was excellent. The special was steak and eggs and I was expecting it to be not great. Most other places have dry steak for breakfast. The server (who was vegetarian) said the steak was really good. I took a a chance and got it. IT TURNED OUT AMAZING. It was medium rare to perfection. The potatoes were good too. Absolutely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by and grab breakfast with the boyfriend. It was really good. Fresh ingredients and for as busy as it was, great customer service."}
{"text":"Wow...I can't believe I haven't been here in years...next time will be much, much sooner!  We stopped in at lunch time last week and I ordered the skinny with egg whites, chicken apple sausage and spinach with a side of grilled tomatoes and a blueberry honey lemonade - absolutely perfect and delicious!  Great atmosphere, great service and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Small cute place. Get there early or ull be waiting a long time"}
{"text":"MATT'S BIG ATTITUDES! Avoid the bar. There are many other bars in terminal 4 for some reason this bar you are dirt under their feet. Hot beer on tap and cold attitudes.  I travel thru phx airport 42 weeks a year. Eaten here many times. Wasn't till tonight when i met Melissa the bar tender i was compelled to write about it. Avoid her. Mean as s snake."}
{"text":"This place had the best service of any airport restaurant I have been to. They were busy and short staffed but everyone who helped us was cheerful and quick. We got our food fast, our drinks faster. It tasted great. Amazing place!!"}
{"text":"Maybe my fave breakfast spot in the west!!  Rustic outdoor ascetic gives way to a well ordered and lively dinning experience inside.  The breakfasts are big and tastes and well priced.   I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Good food...good service...bad location...long wait. The food gives it the xtra star. Triple D...c'mon man!"}
{"text":"After hearing so many positives about Matts Big Breakfast, I decided after retrieving my friend from the airport to go and get my breakfast on! Love at first sight , no!! But never judge a book by it's cover, right? Huh, maybe... Parking is minimal, and in that part of the city.. It can be dicey to find parking . The place is tiny.. Tinier & more cramped with dreadful decor... Much like Over Easy, in fact! There are a handful of basic breakfast selections.. With catchy names though.. I ordered the 'hog & chick' for example.. Only bc I wanted to have poached eggs.. That was     just the easiest way to get them& I passed my 'hog' on to my hungry hog  loving friend... The eggs are free range &  were perfectly poached, score ! Finally some chef in the desert got my poach correct... I'm very picky on the poach... Not like it's a hard process, I know as I have the calphelon pan for poaching in my own loft! I loved my home fries.. Big nice wedges of potatoes.. Sidenote -- too many Rosemary stems.. For me and my built in retainer , it could become a toothy disaster ! And whoa with the onions... Yikes ! Great for flavor, but not unless your planning on being amongst the masses following breakfast! There were a ton of big slivers of white onion.. But once your past picking all the flavor adding things out,you have great home fries..my friend has the hashbrowns, she said they reminded her of OreIda with alot of grease...I've never been a fan of shredded potatoes seemingly devised to soak up oil from the pan , so I wouldn't test them... Loved the bread... Wow! Homemade jams too.. Yum! There was no fruit on the plate.. It's presented in a basic diner way.. I personally like some fruit when I go down the breakfast path.. Relatively inexpensive.. Coffee , nothing special & no options for espresso ... Thot I was going to have a small panic attack over that alone... One other disappointment... Restroom?? No.. It's next door in a divey looking motel with wooden shutters ... I'll wait & use the Starbucks restroom as I drive home disappointed and needing espresso fast.. I'm thinking I'm seriously picky with my breakfast/brunch & just unable to find a 4star option here.. Oh well, I fly for free... I'm goin back to Cali.."}
{"text":"Food was not great. Frustrated with the giant pancakes and the minuscule amount of syrup. Asked for more and they charge $1.50 for another thimble if syrup. I remember eating at the old location and enjoying it. Not any more.  I will not come back here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food as always. Came here for breakfast by myself to relax and read a book. Service was good. Had the special which was the eggs and biscuits with gravy.  Large portion, very savory and tasty! However because there was no wifi and I couldn't get the hotspot to work on my mobile phone so I couldn't download the book I wanted to read on my iPad. Server recommended going across the plaza to the coffee shop if I needed wifi."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place to stop by for food when in the PHX airport - perhaps the only place to get a decent meal! I ordered a salad to go. The woman behind the counter was super kind to me in talking to me about the different food options they have, as well as getting me a menu to order something directly from the kitchen. I ordered Tossed Cobb and waited a few minutes for it to get prepared. I realized two minutes later that the salad was already available in the refrigerated section, but the woman insisted that I order a freshly-made salad. And it was delectable! Warm chicken on top of crisp vegetables, and enormous - this is the kind of salad I want for $10. Next time, I'll try the true breakfast items that this place is known for."}
{"text":"Don't even bother if pressed for time...after waiting 25 mins for my \"to-go\" order of one sandwich that never appeared I had to sprint to catch my flight..  before ordering at to go counter told hostess flight left in 30 minutes, response food takes 15 minutes tops.  Told me no problem! Ordered a breakfast sandwich and waited, waited, waited... looked like staff moved in slow motion.. asked hostess to check on the food bc i needed to board.  she strolled off to back of kitchen and stood chatting up staff.  I waited for a few minutes and the ran to catch he flight sans food. Really shouldn't have a Togo counter..  Actually the airport should just get rid of Matt's and replace it with Over Easy - a phx based restaurant that undoubtedly could do a much better job..."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. It doesn't look like much from the outside but you won't be sorry if you give this place a chance."}
{"text":"Put my name on the list and was told it's a 30 minute wait. Ok, it's a pretty good waffle so I'll wait. After 45 minutes I start to see other people asking where they are on the list as apparently their time had expired as well. I ask how much longer and was told there's 11 people ahead of me??  How can there be 11 people ahead of me after 45 minutes into a 30 minute wait?  I know wait times are approximate, but 30 minutes vs 1 hour and 15 minutes isn't a mistake, it's a lack of knowledge or ability of their staff. For that reason alone, I'll never go back and will be sure to warn anyone who ever mentions this place."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of trying this location after swearing off the original due to the wait times and poor staff. Apparently this location is no better. The wait wasn't bad but the hostess never mentioned the waffle iron is broken today. Only after being seated did I learn the only item I would get from here isn't available today. What a waste of time."}
{"text":"The food is very good, reliably good. Unfortunately, if you have dairy/gluten issues its a tough place to go. I miss the french toast :("}
{"text":"I couldn't be happier that Matt's Big Breakfast moved into my hood :) I'd been to the downtown location before (and absolutely loved it!), but recently tried out the new one in Biltmore. It's exactly what you'd expect: cute decor, friendly servers, fast service.  First time? Try the griddle cakes! These are not your mama's pancakes. They are sort of like the love child of a pancake and cornbread. And they're delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Always delicious, have to stop every time I'm in Phoenix. There is always a pretty good wait, but it's worth it. Home made jam, thick cut bacon, what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"Been here several times now and it is soooo good. The wait can be obnoxious, but once you start eating, you know why. Its a got a nice menu that covers a variety of flavors and the service is pretty fast. The money is in the food though. Ridiculous waffles at this place. The bacon is amazing as well. I'll def keep coming back."}
{"text":"We didn't even get to eat here. The guy that took our name never wrote our name down so they took like 4 parties before us. When we went to ask about when it was our turn. He said we never checked in. The same guy who took our name. Now # this would normally not been a big deal. Shit happens, no one is perfect and they're super busy. But the reason they get one star was his attitude about it. He could of been like  \" I'm so sorry, let me find a table right away\" but instead he chose to argue. Customer service is very important for an experience at a restaurant. This guy pushed us to leave. I dont see us trying this place anytime soon"}
{"text":"10 minute wait for a table. There were 2 of us. They wouldn't separate the 4 top for us and the couple right behind us. Wait, a table for 4 finally arrived. No wait, their table was ready.  No waffles ( or any sweet & savory) and no mushrooms. Antone, who originally took our name, was a pleasure. The gal he was working with (no name tag) actually was yawning while talking to us. Might be a little thing but not a good first impression. We waited 24 minutes for our food and I had to send my pancakes back because they were burned on the bottom. My husband's breakfast burrito was mediocre at best (his words) It was a Sunday morning at 9am."}
{"text":"It's ridiculous that this place has such a low rating. It easily serves up the best breakfast in the valley. It's not fancy or complex, but it's quality ingredients are of the highest caliber, making their dining experience tough to beat.  They get extremely busy, so that can be a drawback, and their service staff is a little slow or maybe unobservant but that's never stopped the food from being out of this world."}
{"text":"WOW! I just needed some breakfast and got a lot more than I came for! The thick cut bacon was amazing, the eggs were cooked exactly to order, and the bread came along with some really good jam. This place only uses the best ingredients. I'll be going to this place anytime I'm at at the Phoenix airport - even if it's not time for breakfast!"}
{"text":"After my ARR 5k @ South Mountain I drove home on Central.....decided to stop and try this place. Walked right in and was able to sit at the bar. I ordered OJ and the basic 2 eggs, toast, delicious thick bacon and the best home fries.....they are awesome rosemary white potatoes with onions. The only draw back is the place is small so it's a little noisy.....but very popular!"}
{"text":"Don't miss out on this Phoenix gem. This place is legit! There may be a line, but don't worry, all things that are great in life are worth waiting for! I love that they have Iowa pork on the menu. It is so amazing!"}
{"text":"Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Not one employee walked past our table without asking if we needed something or refilling our drinks. I had the waffle and it was the most buttery, light, delicious waffle I've ever had! Totally melted in my mouth! The wait is totally worth it. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The best pancakes I've ever had!! Definitely a place to visit for good brunch with the whole family"}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way to the airport and had a most amazing breakfast ever.  Super fresh food, funky cute place, reasonable prices.  I ordered pancakes with patty sausage.  The pancakes were really hot, which melted the REAL butter perfectly and was served with hot 100% maple syrup.  So good.  The sausage patties were generous (probably 8oz total), uniquely spiced and delicious.  Coffee was great and refilled regularly, which means service was excellent.  My brother in law had the special - a spicy Mexican egg combination with lots of jalapeños, spicy chorizo and cheese. He only had good things to say.  My sister had bacon and eggs, over easy - eggs cooked perfectly.  The bacon was really peppery and thick - yummy if you like peppery bacon.  At any rate, we had a great, big, breakfast - really recommend this cheerful, tasty little establishment!"}
{"text":"Stopped here because Yelp had high rating and reviews were positive. Walked in and the place was busy, but got a table right away. Menu was very simple, not a whole lot of variety, because of that my wife and I were deciding if we should eat here or not? We decided to stay, ordered the food on the menu, WOW! We we're so glad we stayed. Food was delish, coffee was just right. We will be back. Thank you for teaching us simplicity."}
{"text":"So good. Soooooooo good. Waffles were on point. Plus they had coffee. Too bad there wasn't any alcohol for the shitty date I was on"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I have tried several items from the menu and loved them all! Daniel is always friendly and makes you feel welcomed! I give Matt's Big Breakfast 2 thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"My dad and I wanted to try a new breakfast place and really enjoyed this one. We got to pick our seat immediately on a Sunday afternoon. The service was good+fast, and the food was yummy too. The only thing we didnt like was how they charged $1.50 for an extra little pitcher of syrup, whereas in most breakfast places we've tried the syrup is free. But overall it was great!"}
{"text":"The sourdough and jam is amazing and you don't even need to order it wow I love it. This place is also incredibly affordable. $6 dollar for a great breakfast."}
{"text":"There will be a line ... you will wait - probably for an hour ... and you'll be happy you did. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The burger was one of the best I have ever had.   Don't let the appearance of the building scare you off. Make it happen. This place lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Saw it on TV and had to check it out while in town. Had the waffle with bacon, all great. Wife had the salami scramble with sourdough toast. Some of the best toast I have ever had. Everything I saw looked great and the owners were both there, always a good sign. There was a wait and parking can be hard, but if you want a good breakfast in Phoenix this is the spot. Next time I am in Phoenix I will be going back."}
{"text":"I didn't have anything wrong with my meal and service was perfect. However, the breakfast is just average. I went because people said so many great things, kind of a let down."}
{"text":"I remember stumbling into Matt's Big Breakfast years ago when I first arrived by car in Phoenix with my crash mate .. we were hungry and downtown. I was a new Arizonian and Matt's looked like a regular Mom & Pop type of place. Once we found parking, ( this was before downtown really 'arrived' and it was still relatively easy), we ventured to Matt's and surprisingly found this long line! That kind of thing always intrigues me, so we waited awhile and thus, my first Matt's experience was born. I remember it being very good, basic, but good. Low and behold when I was in my old neighborhood recently getting my hair blow dried up, over and out , I met up with that same bestie crash mate and we re-visited Matt's. Only HERE, in Camelback. Yes. The long line does still exist, even at this location. No matter what time of day, as I have been to said blow dry bar often, and I always see a line at Matt's! Take note: that means it's good! Basic breakfast foods await you at Matt's. The Hog and Chick is my personal favorite. It's simple and it's good : Two eggs any way, ( I go for poached); home fried potatoes ; a thick slab of bacon; toast of any liking and their homemade jam! Matt's uses high quality, local & organic , when possible on most of their items. Since I am not a fan of what GMO's have done to us Americans... I look for that anywhere and any chance I can get it , is a plus. The coffee is ever flowing as is the H2O for us parched desert people. The juice is fresh squeezed. What more can I say? Matt's is simple , basic and takes it to the level of greatness without really having to try. NOW, as someone who loves to linger over a Bloody Mary or Mimosa at a weekend brekky? I would LOVE to see Matt's bring those two things to their city restaurants. They haven't. The Bacon Bloody Mary does exist at the PHX Sky Harbor location...& it's amazeballs. Maybe in the future! Matt's has done something right... simple is good.. being basic is awesome."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER!! The cashier Stephanie at the to-go spot was terrible and super rude! I get you are busy but rolling your eyes at someone is completely uncalled for!"}
{"text":"We wound up eating at this particular location due to the fact that their other location in downtown phoenix had a longer wait time.  It's not a particular expansive establishment, but they managed to make do with what they had. They definitely had an overwhelming amount of patrons. Every table was taken, and there was a prolonged wait.  They have wonderful service, and their food; although not spectacular, was quite tasty. The food selection isn't vast, but what they do offer, they execute quite well.  I had the hog and chick, and my wife had the waffles. She was more enthused about her selection, than I was about mine.   Overall, it was quite a satisfying brunch, supplemented by wonderfully brisk and attentive service."}
{"text":"Despite the waffle tasting very very good, my family's overall disappointments far outweigh the few positives and (I/we) will likely not be returning. Breakdown of the \"experience\" is as follows:  Hash browns- terrible, no one ate them; to be fair, we did not try the home fries Bacon- LOADED with pepper; probably great for an Bloody Mary Coffee- not a lot of options for sweeteners and coffee cups are stained inside (all 4 at Table) Sourdough toast was good. They could/would not substitute fruit for the hash browns. Patio looked nice, but no outdoor heaters and the temperature was in 46 degrees.  Last but not least, Unfortunately the service was sub-par, we were really looking forward to trying this new location which appeared to have all the ingredients to be a new favorite spot...location is PRIME though, I can see parking being a little tricky on a busy morning. Maybe their lunch menu is better..."}
{"text":"When we are in Phoenix  for business we tend to eat breakfast here. The food is yummy, the place is small and Matt tends to be around to say hey and help serve up the grub. I like the oatmeal of all things...my husband really likes the scrambles. I love that it's small and homey the food is good and it's not too pricey. Also, I love to give my business to ma and pa places as opposed to, say...IHOP or Denny's. (YUCK)"}
{"text":"The single handed worst breakfast experience I've ever had. The only time I've ever waited over 50 minutes for a table before giving up. I came alone on a Saturday at 9am. I asked how long the wait would be for a party of one and the hostess(I guess you could call her that) stated that, \"they don't quote times, but that it goes fast.\" They don't write down the time you arrive so either management doesn't care how long the patrons are waiting for a table or are to dumb to look into it. I find it rude, disrespectful, and disingenuous to patrons to not quote a time on one hand while saying it goes fast on the other. They must have known that patrons were waiting close to an hour for a seat and they are hoping that we would become \"pot committed\" and hang out for the table.      Maybe they are hoping that you will wait so long that you get so hungry that the food will taste better. I've eaten at Matt's Big Breakfast before and I would give it 4 out of 5 stars on food quality. They aren't spectacular just good. Sadly Phoenix is deeply lacking in good breakfast joints.      So starving after a 50 minute wait I decided to head home and stop at McDonalds (also a one star restaurant, but at least I won't wait 50 minutes to get to place my order). While en route I drove by LO LO'S CHICKEN AND WAFFLES approx. 2 miles from Matt's big (slow) breakfast and noticed that it was fairly empty at 10am. I pulled in to Lo Lo's and was pleasantly surprised to find a hidden gem for breakfast. How about that the worst breakfast experience turns into one of the best. I was immediately sat at a table(there was enough space for 8 person parties. Coffee was promptly brought and it was perfect in every respect of the word. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and I was dumbfounded why I tried to go back to Matt's Big (slow) breakfast with so many other options available.     Two additional points I'd like to make: first, there was a bunch of people waiting for Matt's Big (slow) Breakfast but it wasn't a constant flow of additional people coming it was the same bunch of people waiting for 50+minutes; second, YOU'VE been warned.     If you want to try something different/unique/and worthwhile give LO LO's Chicken and Waffles a shot at breakfast. I don't mind waiting for a table at a desirable restaurant. What I mind is a restaurant that doesn't value it's patrons enough to respect their time and to allow their patrons to make conscious decision if they want to wait or not."}
{"text":"Service was fast.  Food was terrible. Got the Breakfast Burrito - it smelled weird like it was fished out of a garbage can and tasted like something was rotten inside.  I can't believe I ate even one bite of that thing. I seriously thought I was going to hurl."}
{"text":"We heard this was the best breakfast place in the Phoenix area so we had to check it out.  The long wait wasn't fun, but we figured if that many people were willing to wait almost an hour (10:30am on a Saturday, go figure), then it must be good.  It did not disappoint. The waffles were great, but my favorite was the homefries!  It was small and quaint and we had good service with a friendly staff.  Oh yeah, and they serve RC Cola, which made it even a better experience for me."}
{"text":"A great place to eat!   This time I have to say that I've had a bit of bad luck because the last two times I came (within 30 days) my home fries have been burnt/charred. I can appreciate some crunch but there shouldn't be anything black on my plate. :( my scrambled eggs were semi runny/watery. Sausage and sourdough toast were perfect! Lol  Service was good. Sat unacknowledged for a good 10 minutes before my server came, but was good after."}
{"text":"I love a good breakfast place, but Matt's Big Breakfast is the definition of mediocre.  The menu only has a handful of options for breakfast and lunch, which is fine (especially when the dishes are exceptional) but they are incredibly basic. They didn't taste terrible, but they weren't that great either; the flavor was lacking, and the amount of grease was a little too much for my liking.  I can say the coffee was good, as well as the Arnold Palmer I got, but the food itself... not so great."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place, I was in town on a Business Trip from Minnesota and am so glad I tried it out.  The Breakfast was out of this world, hospitality was amazing as Vanessa my waitress at the Front Area (Bar Area) was very conversational, super friendly, very quick and attentive.  The food came out super quick and was cooked perfectly.  Get there early in the AM as they get busy later.  I highly recommend this place for regulars and for sure anyone visiting from out of town!"}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast sandwich to go. It was huge and damn good! Bacon was perfectly crispy too. The only reason I gave them 3 stars (vs 4 or 5 stars) is because of the nasty girl at the take out register who made me wait nearly 10 min without even acknowledging that she would get to me. She was too busy walking back and forth between the kitchen and the take out register for no apparent reason. Then she was doing something with the coffee maker or something - again, all the while I was standing there waiting for her to take my order. Talk about lack of customer focus. I can't imagine management would be happy with her behavior and lack of customer focus."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  They need to get a much bigger place though.  The waiting for a table is toughest part there.  Its just way too long.  You can get a comparable breakfast at the Farmhouse in Gilbert and not have to wait that long there."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food with decent prices. There's usually a wait but it's definitely worth it! Best eggs and sausage in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Okay hear me out: I think Matt's Big Breakfast is overrated.   There's always a long wait to get in, so I assumed that people were waiting so long because it had to be good. So I finally stuck it out and waited, and boy was I underwhelmed.   Once seated, our server took almost 15 minutes to get to our table. When she did finally greet our table, she didn't say anything but hi before walking off again. Didn't ask us what we want to drink or anything.   When we did order, I got the five spot. It was really, really greasy. Additionally, my friend who ordered \"extra crispy\" hashbrowns got soggy fries instead. It was just upsetting because we had waited close to an hour to get in, and then the service was lackluster and the food was subpar.   I will say that their jam and toast was delicious, and my friend enjoyed her coffee. However, I think there are better places to spend your weekend morning than at Matt's Big Breakfast."}
{"text":"The name is misleading, not a bog portion at all. Plus horrible service each time I've gone. I work in the same complex. I called takeout and the guy asked for 10-15 min. I did some work and went to get my breakfast. The loud mouthed host who took my order did several rounds of coffee to the guests before greeting me. I stood at the counter for a good 5-10 minutes. No apology when he did, only wanted my name and money. I proceeded to wait patiently for another 20 minutes two people behind me ordered and were served. The host/manger then asked me for my name again and checked the takeout shelf. It had been sitting there the whole time. When I got back to my desk the food was cold. Not worth the $13 for the special. This is the last time I go and I haven't been impressed with the place since it opened. Support another breakfast joint and avoid this location."}
{"text":"besides the wait, being i am not a patient person all i can say its worth the wait  .this is my first visit the breakfast was simple but delicous bacon excellent great hash browns and thick baked bread slices and well priced oh and fab staff"}
{"text":"For once, the Hub enjoyed his food !  What is with the warehouse turned restaurant decor???? is this the new fad now...  I have to agree with of the other surveyor on this page....I was not wowed.   it started with my coffee. they didn't have half/half. ..I know, I know but to be a breakfast place, milk just don't cut it for me...sorry semi-coffee snob.  BUT...the service was fast! all the servers worked together so when we flagged down a server, they all came running   Did I mention we got our food lickity  split?!?!?!?!?  I got the hog and chic... (not a fan of crisp (almost burnt) peppered  bacon with crispy Hash brown (that was good) and 2 pcs of thick slices of sourdough. ...they automatically gave me grape Jam, which I don't like, so I asked for strawberry instead. That was homemade...not the smuckers kind with the foil top.  The Hub got the Saturday special, chorizo scrambled. ..he loved it."}
{"text":"My experience at this great little breakfast place was very positive for my first visit. I am looking forward to going back again. Service was excellent friendly staff food delicious and many choices and healthy eating.  It was comfortable and relaxing and not noisy. I actually felt like we were on vacation sitting there it was fun."}
{"text":"Really delicious food, but the wait can be really long. Try and get there early or on a weekday, or often they can have single counter seats available"}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast is a wonderful place in the morning to feel the life of downtown Phoenix.  I have eaten there 5 times in the last year and each meal was worth the 10 to 20 minute wait out side on the sidewalk.    At 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, July 3, my wife Marie and I ventured downtown and decided to have breakfast out.  Matt's was on our mind.  We waited outside only 5 minutes before getting a table by the window next to the kitchen entry.  Busy place, but the service was great.  Quick with the coffee for Marie and ice tea for me.  Marie ordered an omelet with cheese and mushrooms, while I decided on the special, eggs benedict.  We both had the home fries.   When everything arrived, the meal was very yummy.  Marie, in her delicate way, snarfed down her omelet with a smile.  My eggs benedict was on a fresh English muffin, topped with ham, poached eggs, and a yummy hollandaise sauce.  Calories be damned!  The whole meal cost $22.53 + 4.00 tip.  Yes the place is small and you'll most likely have a short wait for a table, but get over that, because the experience of eating good food prepared by great people is worth your time."}
{"text":"When I was at Pizzeria Bianco, the second in line peeps mentioned that I try Matt's Big Breakfast. I had also saw the episode on Triple D with Guy Fieri and the dude raved that this was his fave. Now I had already put it on the \"must go\" list and then asked for recommendations. I was told to expect an hour wait, order the waffles or griddlecakes and the pork rib chop. Good info...  It was ambitious of us to want to wake up early to have Matt's, but we did eventually get there, even with the stoopid Android GPS getting us lost at First Ave and not First St. We had made a few passes around the block and saw the farmer's market diagonally from Matt's. I dropped off Kathy to put our names down, parked in the lot and headed over to the farmer's market. Now, you couldn't plan this any better, but the market is open Sat and Weds, so what better way to kill time, instead of sitting in heat? After about 40 mins, we headed back and got called immediately.  We got in and ordered waffles with a side of the griddlecakes, since Kathy couldn't decide. I went for the pesto crusted pork rib chop with home fries that were Yukon gold potatoes grilled with rosemary and onions and two eggs over easy. The batter used for both the waffles/griddlecakes were light and fluffy and when you factor in the homemade whipped butter and authentic Vermont maple syrup, the combination is Dyno-mite! My pork rib chop was tender and moist and the Yukon gold fries were absolutely perfect. The thick toast with a side of peach marmalade was delicious. I'm stoked they use locally grown produce, as that ensures that the food is always tip top. The super thick bacon that came with the waffles were just perfect balance of salt and savor. Simply bueno!  I'm always in awe of the other reviewers who were expecting some Iron Chef to blow them away with spectacular gourmet food. To do the basic breakfast items and take them to another level should be spectacular in itself. I highly recommend Matt's Big Breakfast for simplistic elegance and for breakfast that truly did deserve Guy Fieri's adulation.  Housekeeping items: Go Saturdays, so you can check out the Farmer's Market with all the free and tasty samples. That should keep you busy as your name floats to top of the wait list. The wait staff wants to turn over tables, so other Yelpers can get in and eat too.   Stay hungry my friends and happy eatings..."}
{"text":"Come here for lunch (but not too late because they close at 2pm). Then, get the Butter Burger. Even the memory of this burger makes me giddy with excitement. It's freakin' huge too. A hand formed patty, and fresh & fluffy bun. Wow, this burger will knock your socks off. Amazing quality and flavor. One of the best burgers in the entire Valley."}
{"text":"Do not miss the chance to enjoy this local favorite! I was so excited to learn that Matt's  Big Breakfast opened a spot in the airport. A real treat."}
{"text":"I ordered a Belgian Waffle, side of hash brown and freshly squeezed orange juice.   The Belgian Waffle was amazing! It was soft, fluffy and so sweet!  The hash browns were definitely crispy and large quantity. The freshly squeezed orange juice was actually freshly squeezed. It's B-O-M-B! It's about $4.50 for a tall glass.   Get there early! They're full all day everyday!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a good breakfast in a completely casual setting, Matt's is the place. The griddlecakes (aka pancakes) and waffles were a light and melted in your mouth. My dad has the hash browns and he loved the twist on them. What the atmosphere lacks, the staff makes up for. If you want good breakfast food, eat here."}
{"text":"Every other restaraunt in an airport will get you your food before 30 minutes,  it's not even busy, wtf."}
{"text":"The day after I moved to Phoenix I was wandering around downtown alone, and came upon this gem. I may be a bit biased because breakfast food is my favorite food, but I was super impressed with the quality of the food and the culture Matt's propagates. I felt like a super nerd for eating alone amongst groups of families and friends, but the servers made me feel like a priority. In addition to my waiter, I had several other employees fill my coffee cup and water when they passed my table. It's rare to find a restaurant where the servers watch out for each other, and put the customer first, regardless of whose table they're at."}
{"text":"I was so very excited to eat here as I had been trying for a number of years.  The wait was not bad and we were seated within 30 minutes on a Thursday morning.  Everyone was polite and this being a very tiny spot everything was quick. I ordered the waffle and bacon and my mom had the ham and cheese omelet. WOW is all I can say we were both impressed and I really enjoyed the waffle and the thick sliced bacon.  I really really enjoyed the thick sliced bread with the strawberry preserves and the omelet was amazing. Also the chocolate milk was very very good.  If your in phoenix I cant say enough that you should try Matt 's for friendly service and great food. It is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Perhaps the breakfast joint that I most desire to like, but can't.   NEVER get the hash browns. No one likes soggy, undercooked potatoes. Tastes/feels like diced wet cardboard. Home fries are a marginal improvement, only due to the rosemary, in truth.  I've been to Matt's four times. Each time I leave disappointed. Still, I feel the draw to come back and give it another go. It's like that narcissistic girlfriend who gives you a glimpse of hope that things might get better. They don't.  Downtown has better service, btw. This place sucked it up hard last time I took my parents and kids out to breakfast. Incredibly inattentive and sloth-like service, with latecomers getting served and leaving long before our small group of 5. Never again, Matt; I'm breaking up for good."}
{"text":"Matts I LOVE YOU!  Not only are you an integral part of my joy for life but you always provide my wife and I the best breakfast dates.  I love eating the skinny, or hog and chick, they be my faves!  Oh and the coffee! Heck yes! You guys don't serve that bitter burnt disgusting junk they serve elsewhere.... , your coffee is DA BOMB!  The home fries? Forget about it!  So stinking good!  The experience has always been great 99.9% of the time #nooneisperfect.  If you like breakfast food then you should probably hate Dennys haha and love MATTS!  Matt's doesn't have a you pick 3 for $6 menu, because their menu items are thought out and awesome!  Let's go Tempe come check out Matt's!"}
{"text":"Matt's you rock! Thank you for providing me tasty food every time!  Just like humans some times your service is chaotic and lackadaisical BUT I still love you because your food and service overall is top notch, compared to other joints.  Keep being you and keep gettin dem checks! (Shout out Jalen and Jacoby)"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Bacon to die for. Had to hunt staff down for coffee, but they were sweet and super busy. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"To preface this: I actually really enjoy Matt's Big Breakfast - the food tends to be great quality, and service is fine. I just do not like the customer service at THIS Matt's (at the airport).  Tl;dr - poor customer service will cost you (both reputation and cash).  My wife and I gave our name to the host (who was this older, very curt fellow) and moved about 4 feet away from the entrance to make space for others to pass through and/or add themselves to the waiting list. The host told us it would be about 15-20 minutes but hopefully faster.  My wife and I then started having a conversation off to the side while still listening for our name to be called. Meanwhile there was a really outgoing waiter who was very personable serving people just on the other side of the barrier we were standing by.  As we are standing there, I spot about 5 groups get called in, so I figure we are getting close. It's been about 12 minutes at this point. I go to check the list, and there's a lot more names crossed off the list AFTER us. I mean about 15 names scratched off AFTER us. No way we heard him call that many names for people. It honestly just looked like he was arbitrarily crossing people off the list. And indeed our name was crossed off, but I decided to double check with him anyway.  I ask the host if he called our name (I swear he did not), and he said he did but we did not respond. His tone was incredibly rude, too - like he was gloating about it. We were literally 4 feet from his stand. What?  At this point, I realize it might have been possible that we missed our name being called as the outgoing waiter was really loud, but please, if you see us 4 feet away, just call it again to make sure. Better yet - switch the host and the waiter. No way would we have missed his call. The original host was mumbling by comparison, and he looked like he hated being a host.  The best the host offered was to put us back on the list, but at that point, I had no faith in his ability to be courteous or to call our names when our turn was up, so we just left. Your time is better spent at an establishment that will at least try (and not just rest on the laurels of being a known restaurant)."}
{"text":"Was expecting a wait since this place is very popular but we got seated right away. It was definitely packed.  We started the morning with their freshly homemade lemonade with honey. Highly recommended! The honey at the bottom makes it complete.  The special for the day was the French toast and sausage.  French toast was surprisingly not soggy but right texture. It was not overly sweet either. Sausage waa grilled to perfection.   Had the scramble eggs with arugula salad. This was a light and refreshing dish to start the day.  Staff was very attentive!"}
{"text":"Fresh food. Very tasty. There is a very good reason why there has been a line to get in EVERY time I have gone. SO worth the short wait."}
{"text":"This is a true breakfast/quick lunch spot. If you go in there with 6 people, you dont get it. If youre mad you had to wait 30 minutes for a 2 top, you dont get it. If you dont put your name down, YOU DONT GET IT! But if you can just show up, put your name on a list, and patiently wait till it gets called you will be privied to one of the best b-fast joints in town. Everything from top to bottom just tastes fresh (mostly because their product is almost all locally provided). The Chop an Chick is a great place to start, a hearty pork chop that has been marinating in some sort of love, most of the breakfasts are served with your choice of gold potatoes with rosemary and onions, or hashbrowns, eggs, and toast from Tammy Co. Bakery, they also serve it with fresh preservatives. The special is always good and always different! All in all I drive 25 minutes to this place atleast once a month and I have yet to have any sort of dissapointment once. If you ask, wheres my toast, YOU DONT GET IT!!!!"}
{"text":"This is how mornings should always start - and personally this is exactly what most of my Phoenix mornings have offered.   Get up, get going, stop at Matt's. Friendly greetings and superfluous amounts of hot coffee - admittedly in the thin end of the scale, but then again I love my coffee most when it's stronger than me.  The daily menu is big and full of energy, way larger than a serving should be -  in other words, an average american size. Over a couple of days I had pancakes, hash browns, fries, goat cheese, ham, bacon, lot's of chilly and so many eggs that I had to send friendly thoughts to every egg-lovers favorite scientist, Ying Rong of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (\"Higher consumption of eggs is not associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease or stroke\"). It's a nice touch that they use real butter and cage-free egg production.   I like the place even better than the food. The place is vivacious, all customers seem happy in the loud way. Sunday was crowded and full of groups of families and friends. Going alone I mostly sit in the bar area - which creates opportunities to talk to other people. Had an interesting conversation with a local cop one day and a student the next, and of course morning banter with the staff.   Get up, get going, stop at Matt's."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place.  Love the food, love the prices, love the decor.  But...  HATE THE WAIT.  They know me.  My wife and I bring our two small kids here every week or two.  But our AVERAGE wait time, sitting in front on nice modernist benches, is about 25 minutes.    It sucks.  I wish they would get rid of two rows of parking, put up an overhead tent with heaters/misters.  But I think the fact that people have to wait actually increases the love of the place?  Strange, huh.  Food is delicious.  I love the aged cheese omelet.  Go for the home fries, which are delicious and dusted with fresh rosemary, over the overly buttery hash browns.  Almost everything on the menu is perfect.  My kids do a single pancake, perfectly cooked, with great syrup.    Their bread may be the best part.  Fresh, thick cut bread with butter and fresh jam/jelly.  Look, it's a slightly upscale \"diner food\" that is well worth every $ you spend and every calorie you consume.    I hate to give a good review... what if even MORE people come and my wait is even LONGER... :("}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great prices. It was our first time here, we definitely hope to come back next time we're in town. We stayed downtown so it was only 5 mins to get here. Hotel breakfast is so dull and all the same, refreshing to get something better. I would come back to Matt's."}
{"text":"I personally prefer to go to the 32nd St & Camelback Location, as this location usually has a ridiculous wait-time. Now, that's not to say the wait isn't worth it, it's just a personal opinion that breakfast food shouldn't take an hour+, and I have been a few times, some of which luckily didn't require an extensive wait. In any case, the food is as good as you can expect, a little pricey, but indeed one of the best breakfast spots in Phoenix. Like any good breakfast place, they'll make pretty much anything you want, and have a daily feature, but it's hard to have to stray from the menu. Between their Chop & Chick (two eggs and a skillet-seared pork chop) or the Belgian Waffle, you simply can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, as well as the downtown Phoenix and the airport location, and it's always a treat. A basic, homestyle hearty breakfast, but their bacon is outstanding, can't help but to have second helpings!"}
{"text":"What I Ate - waffle - bacon - 2 scrambled eggs - hashbrowns - glass of milk  Would I Go Again? Yes--I had a fantastic breakfast at Matt's.  I asked the waitress what are the most popular items on the menu, and one of the items she listed was the waffle.  The waffle was so good!  The batter was great, it was cooked perfectly, and the sweet cream butter and maple syrup completed the waffle's deliciousness.  The hashbrowns are my all-time favorite hashbrowns!  No competition.  The eggs were good (hard to go wrong with scrambled eggs), and the thick bacon was delicious.  Big thanks to Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives for helping me find this little gem in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"First time today at Matt's. Had the special which was andouille sausage scrambled eggs with spinach and cheese. Let me tell you it was fantastic. The homemade strawberry preserves sourdough toast delicious coffee and great service make this a must stop for those living in the downtown area. Not a long wait, service was quick and I would recommend this breakfast spot to  anybody."}
{"text":"Finally made it in during a weekday, food was good but not worth the wait I see every weekend. Solid breakfast and good seemingly fresh food.  Not affecting the review but I want to mention the waitress not wanting to bring back my change, assuming I'd given them a 25% tip. I was happy to tip that amount and can understand the assumption, but when I ask \"where is my change\" I was disappointed at the response I got back. I hate to be the guy who writes a food that's less about food, but it left a sour taste to an overhyped staple of downtown Phoenix. Better places, better service."}
{"text":"A friend from Napa was in town and on a whim we decided to go. Matt's, as expected was busy, and as promoted it was absolutely worth the wait.   I had pancakes and my friend had a more traditional egg breakfast with a bacon option. Extra extra good bacon.    My friend was still raving about her breakfast last week and it was over a month ago that we had gone to Mantz. Just remember there will be a wait and it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Went later on Sunday and waited for 45 min for two people, very irritating...when we eventually were served the food was just..OK. I've eaten at many similar type restaurants in So. Cal, like Good Stuff, Scottys, Joe's etc. and Matts food doesn't even come close to quantity, quality or imagination to qualify the more pricey menu for such food...I saw burned hashbrowns and bacon pass me by on its way to being served...Was extremely disappointed and drove 50 miles to try....however, people are lined out the door...just not that imaginative! Come on Arizona!"}
{"text":"This Matt's Big Breakfast is located in the new Marina Heights campus. Parking is easy, and they make sure to validate you ticket. There is usually no wait, but it does get super busy during lunch time.  The menu is limited but very delicious. I got the Waffle with bacon, and I could not leave a bite behind. Also, you get your food very quickly, so you are usually in and out.  I will definitely go again, plus I like the location more than the downtown location."}
{"text":"The waffle I had was very good. I found the coffee to be undrinkable though - extremely bitter! Which brings down my review as this is a breakfast restaurant and there's nothing better than starting off breakfast on the weekend with a hot coffee..."}
{"text":"Coffee was so bitter I could barely drink it!! My Waffle was really delicious though. Restaurant was a bit small and not comfortable."}
{"text":"Well the name kinda says it all. It's a big breakfast. Very good food. I just had a basic breakfast with eggs, peppered bacon, home fries, and very good thick wheat toast.  No wait on a late weekday morning.  Very unpretentious appearance,  just good food (and lots of it).  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We had time in Phoenix before a flight and decided to stop at Matt's Big Breakfast for brunch. My boyfriend had the special; something scrambled with jalapenos. I had the belgium waffle and I will say it was pretty delicious. The only thing I wasn't sure about was the coffee (just decent) and they charged for everything extra. It came off as a little \"trendy\".  I'm cool with charging extra if you have to, but it gives off the wrong vibe. I also dislike when places only have \"RC Cola\" and no other soda choices - but that is totally just me! haha"}
{"text":"I expected it to be much better. At 10:30 on a Wednesday, we waited about 15 minutes for a table for two. We ordered the bacon egg and cheese sandwich which truly was just average and An order of pancakes that were dry, crumbly actually, and overpriced at nearly $8. The tables are very close to each other which is fine except the Muzak is blazing loud. So between the close proximity of the other patrons and the loud music it is extremely difficult to hear the person sitting directly in front of you on the other side of the table. The staff was friendly and the service was good, but that's not going to be enough to bring us back again."}
{"text":"Ok place. To me, a great breakfast place is high on great and inexpensive basic breakfast fare and low on pretense. I've been to this place 3 times and the food has been pricey and middling..cold, bland egg white omelets, peppery gravy, mushy homefries.  When asked...\"how was it?\" and I've shared, I have been told \"that's how we do it,\" and ignored for the remainder of my visit.  Plus, almost everything has bacon, can we please have some non pork substitutes? I will state the coffee is good."}
{"text":"My new favorite location. I love the big bar area. Our server was very nice and helpful. Food is simple, but delicious. Definitely a go-to."}
{"text":"The honey lemonade is my favorite! Bacon is awesome. The diced potatoes with rosemary and grilled onions are great. My favorite is the blueberry preserves and the thick sourdough toast!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan. Their potatoes, bacon and fresh blueberry preserves are my favorite. The only comments I would make are that their portions are not very filling & we waited a long time before we received our food."}
{"text":"I am so sad that I found this place on my way out of Phoenix. It is perfect. It was mobbed on a Monday morning, but I was alone and they sat me within about five minutes at the breakfast bar. The server there was friendly and fast and helpful. Come to think of it, everyone was friendly and acted like they were glad to have you there even though there were a bazillion people.   I got bacon & eggs with home fries, and seriously, everything was perfect. The bacon is high quality and not over salted. Crispy on the edges, tender in the middle. The home fries were the gold kind of potatoes, the really creamy kind, and they were seasoned with rosemary. The eggs were cooked perfectly and OMG the toast...it was thick slices of homemade wheat bread and homemade blueberry jam.   I really dug the ambiance and it was all I could do not to steal the orange, covered cake stand off the breakfast bar. I wanted it with all my heart and I still have not recovered. The place is done in a very minimal, industrial vibe with pops of bright orange and yellow.   Also, they have a dispenser of ice water outside for the people who are waiting out there which I thought was a nice touch.  Seriously loved this place. LOVED. Hoping I get to go back to Phoenix soon so I can eat there again. And if that cake plate is still there, I hope they've bolted it down. I might not be able to help myself."}
{"text":"They make an awesome Cobb salad here with really thick bacon. I also tried a Bloody Mary to enjoy the thick bacon again and it was awesome round 2!  I will definitely stop back here next time in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place at all! There was so much grease on the omelet and hash browns it left me grossed out, the pancake tasted like they made it where they burnt some bacon...after all the reviews I thought this would be a good breakfast before flying back to Texas, bad choice for sure. Del Taco would of been a better choice."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast is THE best breakfast in Phoenix. Fresh, organic, and wherever possible, LOCAL ingredients, cooked up to perfection. Delicious coffee. Crowded, especially on weekends. Worth the wait. Get there early or after rush hour on weekdays. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Dear Matt's big breakfast. I dreamt of your waffles last night.    Big, unbelievably fluffy, waffles. Delicious waffles. Best waffles. The sweet cream butter and maple syrup makes this amazing waffles out of this world.   The thick cut bacon is perfectly crispy on the edges but chewy too. So good. The hash brown is perfectly crispy without being burnt and tasty. The scrambled eggs were so fluffy. The blueberry jam that came with the toast was not overly sweet and just so full of ripe blueberry. And the freshly squeezed orange juice. I'm salivating just writing this review!  The wait wasn't long. We went around 8:30 a.m. on Saturday morning and waited maybe 10 minutes for a table. Service was fast and great."}
{"text":"Just got home from eating at Matt's Big Breakfast. Waited for about 15 minutes before we were seated which wasn't too bad. However, after trying the food, I don't think it would be worth it to wait beyond 15 minutes especially during the summer months to eat here.  To start, the menu is a little too small and was missing some key breakfast essentials I thought. Biscuits and gravy... Hello? Anyways, I decided on the chick and chop meal with hash browns, over easy eggs, and sourdough toast. The chop was really dry and tough and at times, flavorless. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash browns, though really greasy, were some of the best I have ever had. The toast didn't taste much like sourdough to me but the home made peach preserves were pretty legit. My husband on the other hand liked the toast. I also ordered a small fresh squeezed OJ. Maybe its just me but I almost felt I would have rather had something from a bottle. Something just didn't taste right to me about the OJ. Lots of pulp, so if you like to chew your OJ, then you might enjoy it. The husband opted for the special: 3 meat scramble with cheese and fresh jalapeno's, hash browns, and tortilla. He said it was alright but was a little weirded out that one of the meats was bologna.  All in all, the prices were not too bad. We felt they were a little skimpier on their portions than other places particularly with the amount of hash browns and the toast. For a place calling itself \"big breakfast,\" I guess I expected more. Would we go back? Being that we are from Maricopa, this is pretty far for us to travel for breakfast so probably not anytime soon. The wait that is almost always present also doesn't seem worth it for a place that had nothing memorable to me other than their hash browns and peach preserves. Maybe if we are in the area and its not summer though..."}
{"text":"An absolutely wonderful breakfast.  I had the special...hot peppers with scrambled eggs.  Couldn't have been better.  Matt's Big Breakfast is a small spot, but I understand they are moving to bigger quarters."}
{"text":"I had heard how amazing this place was and had been avoiding it because it often has a very long wait. We decided to try it on my birthday for breakfast and was so glad that we did! We got seated right away and they served us a great cup of coffee quickly. They also had eggs Benedict as the special that day, which is my favorite! It was wonderful! The service and food was great. I cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich is great. First heard of matts years ago but it was always so busy that I never got a chance to try it... it's well worth the wait"}
{"text":"Upscale diner food done right.  Had a standard eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast.  Bacon was done perfectly.  Tasty fried potatoes, and thick cut toast.  Super friendly staff, and had me in and out in 40 minutes, in plenty of time to catch my flight."}
{"text":"The service was great, everyone was very nice and friendly. Also great was the sourdough toast, jam, honey lemonade, and crispy peppery bacon. The hash browns were buttery and crispy on the outside and yummy and creamy on the inside. I didn't care for the salami scramble, the salami was different than any salami I have, but it was definitely plentiful."}
{"text":"Matt's food quality is exceptional as a customer I am always provided with an awesome customer experience.  If you like a old school diner vibe with an urban twist, Matt's is the place to dine-in if you want to meet with colleagues for lunch, etc....its ideal. Daniel who works there is absolutely remarkable."}
{"text":"so great!!!! we did have a bit of a wait but it was so worth it!  The stand out was definitely the bread and homemade preserves.  I could eat that from here every day.  Amazing.  We all got omelettes and while they were the perfect size and very tasty, could've used more cheese!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you're HUNGRY  The portions are big and the taste is flavorful. The staff is amazing and super nice. Although the wait time was a little on the \"ALMOST too long to wait\" side, I love this place and will eat here again."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast. Another 30 minute wait for food, but I thought it was pretty worth it.  Their special for the day was a three egg scramble with chicken artichoke sausage, organic baby spinach and mozzarella cheese. Very unique and executed quite well - loved the sausage and the freshness of the spinach.  The hash browns were a litte strange (like what would happen if you pressed a potato through a spaghetti-making pasta machine) but nice and  crunchy on the outside.  My wife got the ham and eggs. These were also good, with nicely salted ham.  We also had a side of bacon, which was well peppered and cooked almost to a crisp."}
{"text":"Great airport food but service was over the top.  Michael waited on us and was not only very engaging and attentive but he also made sure we got our order to go on short notice.  Mediocre airport food and service seems to be the standard but this place stood out enough for me to write a review."}
{"text":"Sedona bound from the Phoenix airport, but had to stop by Matt's Big Breakfast after all the rave reviews.  Here's \"The Skinny\", four egg whites scrambled with gruyere cheese, local organic baby spinach and chicken apple sausage cooked in olive oil and served with a green salad.    They call it a simple salad, but love the flavors.   Btw, the sourdough and strawberry preserves are a must."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype.  They hand you menus as soon as you put your name in, as soon as you rear end hits the chair the waitstaff is demanding your order.  After your food has been served you practically have to jump up and down to get any attention.  Food was mediocre at best  and luke warm by the time it got to us.  Not one of the 3 would ever go back"}
{"text":"Beer, bourbon and a side of bacon. Thats what I had here before my flight. Ron Swanson would be proud of me. Great place to catch a buzz before you get on a plane!! Love that they have Goose Island on tap along with local beer!!!"}
{"text":"This place was incredible. I had the Thick & Savory thick cut French toast win smoked apple sausage and it was on point. If you love French toast, then Matt's won't disappoint. The waitress at the bar was super friendly and nice. Only bad thing about this location is the construction outside. Limited parking spot, but the food just made the issue go away! Come out and try Matt's!!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a week on a work trip. I'm a huge breakfast fan and heard about this place from co-workers. The pancakes are AMAZING and I know pancakes, eggs tasted great as well. They have they own coffee brand which was really on point too. The service and staff was stellar. The only thing I didn't like was the fact they only give a small portion of syrup and charge $1.50 for more of it. Great experience, would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Omg, this is probably the best meal I had in Arizona. The rosemary potatoes (aka home fries) are AMAZING! You must order this over the hash brown, do it & thank me later.   I ordered the pork chop & eggs and it was seriously a piece of pork chop. The pork chop was seasoned right, not too salty or bland tasting. The eggs were cooked perfectly as well, I can't say so for all brunch places unfortunately.   This place gets pretty crowded but we were lucky to grab some seats at the bar without having to wait. I believe we were in and out of there within 30 mins. Probably one of the fastest brunch I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Believe the hype, the food is delicious! I recommend anything with bacon or the chorizo with eggs and jalepenos...YUM!  If you don't like the wait, have breakfast for lunch (its pretty easy to get in around one)."}
{"text":"Had the three egg scramble with grilled pork tenderloin and jalapeños that was the special today. Absolutely delicious! If you have a party of six or more be sure to call ahead so you aren't waiting hours outside!"}
{"text":"Was in town for business and was craving some good breakfast before flying back to LA. Yelped this place and it wasn't too far from the hotel so decided to stop by. Even though it was a weekday morning, there was still a sizable wait. Luckily, since it was just me, I was able to get a seat at the bar. I ordered the waffle with no bacon and asked for a side of hash browns as a substitute for the bacon. Also go the blueberry lemonade to drink and it was outstanding. Food came it out and I can legitimately say that it was the best waffle that I had. The butter that came on top of it was out of this world good. Hash browns were a huge portion as well and tasted great. Even though they were slammed the food came out pretty quickly. Service could have been a bit better, the girl working at the bar didn't really seem to care to be there. Also got charged for the hashbrowns when I asked for them as a substitute for the bacon. Not a big deal but it's the small things. Will definitely be back. I'm not a huge breakfast person but this place is outstanding."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE breakfast at Matt's.  Weekdays are better than weekends, or so I have heard, I have never attempted a weekend.  Menu is simple but the food is not."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Came here with my husband for breakfast and loved it. Food is reasonably priced and the service was very friendly. One of the servers wrote a list of other restaurants we should check out for dinner. The food was delicious and made with care, especially their jam, it's a must-have!"}
{"text":"Not a good place for groups.. The food is great! The bacon is better than last time I was here.(at the old spot) Very fast and fresh. The ambience is casual and welcoming. The jelly is Awesome!! I will be back, and I'll take a waffle with some jelly!"}
{"text":"Told this was the best in town so made multiple attempts to go, but left twice because the wait was over 2 hrs... When we finally caught them on an odd morning when the wait was reasonable, found the food was good but not worth the hype.  Plus, had to ask 3 times for my side waffle, and when it was brought out she poured the syrup all over me and made only a half effort to clean it up."}
{"text":"Oh my...oh my gosh!!   I love breakfast, and this place is at the top three for my favorite spots.   So I kind of eat like a dude, I'm not going to lie! This place happens to be one of the few restaurants that fills me up! It might be their amazing fresh potatoes, I swear to you they put some magical unknown ingredient in their potatoes and hash browns. Or maybe it's their daily egg scramble specials that just happen to ALWAYS be amazing. No, no...I'd say it's their fresh bread with their homemade jelly. Okay...let's be real here, it's their BACON!!! I love bacon and they make it absolutely heavenly.  Another thing to try are their pancakes. They might just be the best pancakes I have ever had. Simple buttermilk pancakes, nothing added...they are to die for. Try them, you'll keep kicking yourself in the butt if you don't!  Oh, there will be a wait...BUT IT'S SOOOOO WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I have been here and let .e tell you it was excellent. When we walked in the place looked clean, casual and with a chic look. We are greeted by Vince who happened to be our server. We decided to sit at the bar. We looked at the menu and everything looked appetizing. The restaurant only open for breakfast and lunch. They have special everyday so today was Monday huevos rancheros and my roommate had well cooked fluffy waffles."}
{"text":"Great classic breakfasts, nothing fancy but very fresh and very good. I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Best Airport Food in the World!!  They use consciously sourced ingredients like free range meats and eggs.  Amazing comfort food.  Better than home-cooked meals!  Not just breakfast..they have lunch and dinner items too.  If you have some time at Phoenix Airport, this is the only place to eat in my opinion."}
{"text":"I did not wait long to try this place after going to the farmers market. I have had way way better. The food was so so. My impression here is that folks who rave about this place have never had really good food with flavor. I actually find that a lot in Phoenix...PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW GOOD FOOD HERE!!!! Look at most of the bad reviews and see where most of the people are from. Yeah, not here with exception of myself but I am actually from Los Angeles and have had access all my live to some of the best food around. Matt's big breakfast is a big joke! I actually prefer to go to wildflower over this joint."}
{"text":"I've sadly become one of those people who turn to the Food Network for restaurant recommendations. Okay, not all the time but when a segment airs about thick cut bacon and huge burger patties cooked in butter, I immediately start making travel plans.  We arrived at Matt's for a late-lunch. Being that it was a weekday and close to 2pm, the restaurant was nearly empty and we didn't have to endure the wait or the harried service. In fact, other than a mix-up with toast, the staff was attentive and eager to please (or get us out so they could go home).  I ordered the jalapeno burger with kettle chips and Jules got the Hog & Chick - 2 eggs with bacon. Her hash browns were buttery and sweet. My burger was juicy with a nice kick.  I don't know if I'll jump on the plane the next time I see a tempting food segment but am I glad that we made a trip for some bacon and burger? You bet."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure anyone could do breakfast any better.   We came on a Tuesday at about 9am, after previous attempts, and were seated right away. It is definately small and there is no place to wait inside, just multiple benches outside to bask in the blaring sun. If this is the case, bring sunscreen.  There is a pad of paper, just outside the door, to write your name and total number in party down -- that is known as the wait list.  Don't even try to go on a weekend, atleast in my experience.  Anyway, we both ordered the \"hog and chick\" - it was fabulous. Although they could have cooked the eggs a bit more. The bacon was thick cut and peppered, the has browns were real potatos, the toast was also really thick cut with real butter and local preserves.  The wait staff do not hover, the owner goes around making sure everyone is doing well. It's very heart warming being here."}
{"text":"After standing in line a few minutes on a weekday, we made our way to the bar, I ordered up some pancakes. I should have had the special which turned out to look really good. The pancakes were alright, not great but OK. One thing about pancakes they are designed to need syrup, after all a pancake is a syrup delivery system. The pancakes came with about 1 ounce, about half of a shot glass of syrup. I knew right off that wasn't going to get it done but I figured no problem I would just ask for some more. I asked for more syrup and the lady wanted to make sure I understood they charge $1.50 for syrup, I said bring it on after all what good are pancakes without syrup. The refill came and it was probably about 1/2 an ounce of syrup. I ate most of the pancakes but ended up leaving some since pancakes without syrup is boring."}
{"text":"Matt's is the perfect breakfast place. The menu is simple with only about ten dishes and they have a daily special that is always good. I sat at the bar area and the waitress there was really nice and even offered to put my milk in the fridge so it would still be cold when the food came out. It's a small place,so there will be a wait,but its well worth it."}
{"text":"Matt's has been a favorite of mine for years! The food is good home style cooking that is served in big, hearty portions. The fresh baked bread and house jam are amazing together! The only downside to this place is the wait - come in on a Saturday or Sunday morning and expect to wait for at least 30 minutes. It's worth it but brutal in the summer if you have to wait outside."}
{"text":"This is a long time favorite of ours, all the way back to the OG downtown PHX location. The greatest thing about Matt's is the consistency of the food - it is always perfect every time we go. Scratch made everything. Perfectly cooked eggs, tender breakfast potatoes and the wheat toast is just awesome.   This is the kind of place where they address you by name, and go above and beyond to make sure your service is fantastic. AND they have just started offering their own signature hot sauce -- every part of your experience here is thought of!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in the US.  Hash browns are perfectly crispy, pancakes have a great flavor and texture that pushes up on the border of savory, and the Bloody Marie's might be the most delicious I've ever had (I did have a really amazing one at Aria in Vegas).  Anyways, went to this place a year ago passing through AZ, and couldn't wait to pass through again.  Finally returned, and this spot didn't disappoint.  They slightly screwed up our order, and no less than 3 different servers came out to apologize, so excellent service as with, with a staff of people who seem to enjoy their jobs.  Pretty pretty great."}
{"text":"It was good, but I wasn't blown away. Staff was very nice, very attentive. However plenty of 5-star breakfast joints in this area so we are not likely to return."}
{"text":"We were seated right away. Friendly staff, great food nice place. Came after seeing triple d. Worth the drive from Cali"}
{"text":"Well, here it is folks. My first 3-star rating since starting this project (http://www.hngrysam.com/?p=20) about four months ago. And I'm sure I'll get some flack for it!  I met a friend at Matt's for breakfast around 9am on a Saturday. I expected a wait, and a wait we got. It wasn't too bad, there were benches and shade and lots of conversation. After about 30 minutes we were seated at the bar inside the teeny tiny restaurant.  I loved the simple old-school vibe. We ordered and our food came out FAST, which was nice since we'd been waiting a bit. The food was simple and good, and the service was really great. But why all the hype?  Is it rude of me to give a lesser rating because the place doesn't hold up to the Yelp standard?  I will absolutely give it a second chance, but I fear Matt's might be one of those places people love because other people love it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the chop and chick with the fries but my experience started with a warm orange juice and I was not a fan. And then noticed that splitting checks was not allowed. From a customer's perspective i did not agree. There are no creamers only milk options. An unfortunately, the service was missing enthusiasm. I review only to help better the business."}
{"text":"Food sucked, service sucked. Only one server was nice to us and the one that originally helped us was rude and kept gossiping, using terrible language in front of other customers, and talking about how the other girls working were pissing her off. The food also took forever to come out and it was cold by the time it got to us. Next time I'll play it safe and just do a McDonald's breakfast or something. Do not waste your time or money at this place."}
{"text":"Besides the wait everything was better than expected, the plates were more then a belly full and the service top notch. We ended up in the front room and was nice considering how busy it was. If u have four or less wait for the front room it is quiet and the cashier pays a littler more attention to you."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Waiter Michael is a treasure! Our family was heading to Bakersfield : ( and he managed to put a smile on our faces- service with a smile and truckloads of personality!! Don't let him go!"}
{"text":"Read all the reviews about the best breakfast ever. I have to say it was a neat place. They have the best toast and best strawberry jam I've ever had.. I regret not trying the Honey Straweberry Lemondae. I ordered the Chop and Chick. aka a Pork Chop with eggs over easy and hashbrowns. The pork chop had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The eggs and hashbrowns were your average eggs and hasbrowns, nothing special. I would go back here just for the toast and jam, it's that good."}
{"text":"There are 480 reviews of Matt's Big Breakfast at this time. My guess is that I can't say anything that hasn't been said here or on Food Network. I have wanted to get here for a while, but finally made it in last week with \"second wife\". She and I are always up for sharing, so we got the cheese omelet with wheat bread and the griddlecakes. Wow.  The omelet was large and tasty; it went very well with the Tapatio that we both tried (for the first time!). We got the rosemary potatoes on the side and they were delish. The griddlecakes were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, just perfect. Light and airy with a touch of sweetness.  Saving the best for last... the toast. The bread was dark and amazing- full of seeds and whole grains. It came with a little butter, even though we asked for it dry. There was a small side of house-made blueberry preserves that were incredible. I would go back just for the toast and preserves!  We went on Friday at 1pm, probably a smart move."}
{"text":"When here after seeing it on food network.  The country potatoes and steak omelet with a side of bacon is what I had along with their honey lemonade.  Food was great and service was pretty good.  Everyone was super friendly, it just gets so busy that the work crew can't attend to everyone all the time.  I would definitely go here again.  Probably one of the best breakfasts I've had!"}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome, I had the salami scramble, side of homemade sausage and bacon. I devoured all of it, I really can't say enough,  6 stars!!!! I will be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place, especially for crowds coming through downtown Phoenix and the Convention Center. Matt's is very busy- I had to wait 10 minutes for a 2 person table at 10pm on a Friday morning.  The food was fantastic- I got the bacon and waffles. This big, syrupy waffle was cut by two generous strips of peppered bacon. My bottomless coffee was solid and the server never let it empty.  I visited here with a friend and her young son. The staff was very accommodating to this twitchy toddler (and we were not the only group there with a young child) and had a high chair available for the table."}
{"text":"Worth the wait...amazing food! Every member of my family ate each and every bite! From the coffee to the main dishes, you can taste the fresh, locally selected ingredients. Way to go, Matt's Big Breakfast!"}
{"text":"Salami scramble - I tried to remove all the salami after I tasted rancid fat, but the rancid taste was also on the overcooked eggs.   So I tried to eat the hash browns. They couldn't be cut, chopped or broken with fork or knife, but I managed to spear the entire brick and gnaw chunks off. I felt my teeth did some manly, brutish work."}
{"text":"Darn. This could've been so much better...everyone liked their meal except all 4 of us ordered hash browns and were surprised to find that all 4 were under cooked on the inside. When we asked for them to be more cooked, they delivered 4 more the same way: mushy and slimy. When the manager came around, we told her that they were also under done and she said that is how they make them, stating that they want them to be like mashed potatoes in the middle. We overheard the table next to us have the same complaint and she gave the same comment. They took them off of the bill, which was good. Limited menu and service was just ok. With so many breakfast choices in the Valley, we will skip this one next time."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Matt's, I always have an amazing experience and a superb breakfast. Sunday has to be one of my favorite days there, they have their \"Stake and Eggs\" special. The meat is tender,juicy and full of flavor. Their potatoes are delicious and well seasoned. The thick cut bacon is delicious. The hog and chick is always a great choice, the fruit preserves that comes with is also great. The griddlecakes are also a good choice, fluffy and sweet. Their milk, coffee, and orange juice are delicious. Its a small place so I recommend you go in early so you can avoid waiting to be seated!"}
{"text":"Here with friends. 1:10 wait, YES the new bigger place. But worth the wait. Pancakes Excellent, Omlette fantastic!!"}
{"text":"It's normally a great place but today off on their game. Ordered the Huevos Rancheros but instead brought me the southwest scramble which was scorched and waitress basically dropped it and took off before I could say anything but I didn't want to wait any longer either. Then forget about asking for extra syrup for your pancakes or a side of their green salsa unless you want to pay. They also will not do separate checks even though they're downtown. It's a cool place but feel their attitude is we're so good we don't need your business. Bummer cuz their food is good but customer service is a bit lacking."}
{"text":"When I drove by Matt's, there was a line already waiting outside. I ordered the Chop and Chick since it was highly recommended by My fellow Yelpers. My husband got the Five Spot. I ordered the food to go, since I didn't want to wait and had a baby with me. I'm sure the food would of had me given it 5 stars if I ate it fresh from the kitchen. My favorite by far was their Jam. I'm NOT a jam persons ever but I am for Matt's Jams. It's to die for. It's original and divine flavors can't be duplicated. LOVE!"}
{"text":"Love the food at Matt's but this is the second time at this location and service is horrible here. First time waiter didn't put in our whole order, didn't apologize just asked if we still wanted it. Second time, waited 30 minutes for our food just for another waiter to come out and tell us sorry the computer didn't send your order to the kitchen so they're making it now. Pretty sure that's the waiter's job to check on our order but he was nowhere to be found. We just left after waiting almost 40 minutes. This location needs new management."}
{"text":"They had the steak and eggs as a special today.  It was not very special.  It was dry and overcooked, definitely not medium rare.  The eggs and hash browns were exceptional.  Oh, so were their home made preserves for the toast. Big lines and 30+ min wait to be seated.  Counter seating is NOT self seating like most places so you will be yelled at if you didn't know and walked in and sat yourself. There is construction right outside the restaurant where you will be standing out in the Phoenix weather inhaling dust.  Decore inside is so so, kinda plain.  Two chalk boards with daily specials written on them.  The bathrooms are hidden behind one of the chalk boards, but no signage on the doors to tell you which door is the restroom. Overall, I think this place is overrated,over priced and over crowded.  Like all breakfast themed diners."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with the customer service at Matt's Big Breakfast in tempe. I'm pretty sure our waitress was a bitch or prejudice because all of the other tables she was also waiting on didn't have a problem with their service. We ordered our food and didn't receive it all, and when we asked her for it she just said it will come later and it never came. And I don't know why, but we got really small glasses for water and she never filled up. After that she never came back to check on us. I had to ask another waitress for the check and take it to the to go counter to pay for a meal we didn't even get all of the food we ordered for. I've been here a few times but if the service continues to be like this then I don't think it's worth coming back."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting our daughter attending college in Phoenix. This place is AWESOME, I mean the best place for breakfast I ever had. I scored the food, service, establishment, and management at the highest possible rating of 5, but they deserve a ten. This place is a rare find...."}
{"text":"Coffee was good, orange juice was fresh & delicious.  I had the waffle which came with bacon: OMG, my mouth was in heaven! Bacon was sooo good, covered in black pepper, and the waffle was soft and sweet and oh-so-good!  Boyfriend had the breakfast sandwich: also very yummy.  The wait can be ridiculous. The place is pretty small, but it was very well-priced."}
{"text":"Airport food. Let's keep it simple. The greeter was super nice. The server was super nice. The bartender was super nice. The food came out fast hot. The drinks came out quick and were delicious. And the food....probably some of the best airport food I have ever had. Better than some regular restaurants. And I always expect less of airport food. I was pleasantly surprised. I travel through Phoenix often...will definitely stop by here if I have time. And so should you . ;)"}
{"text":"This place is great for its food! Generous portions not too long of a wait time and very clean!! My only complaint was they were eager to seat us down that they crammed 3 of us at a table clearly built for 2 with one of our backs awkwardly to the table next to us .. it was crammed and a tight space as our food came. I wouldn't have minded waiting a little longer to have more room haha but other than that no complaints!"}
{"text":"I chose this burger place, and I think that Modern Burger would probably have been a better airport choice.  My burger was overcooked, and it didn't taste good at all, despite all of the bragging about being cooked in butter.  Skip it."}
{"text":"Finally had an opportunity to stop here for breakfast and our timing was perfect!  No wait, but within seconds of being seated the entry filled up with hungry folks waiting on a table.  I was surprised (and a little disappointed) that the breakfast menu didn't have more selections/variety.  Once we had ordered, the food was good.  Oddly enough, I liked the thick, fresh wheat toast with home made strawberry preserves.  The liberal application of fresh rosemary in the cottage fries was nice as were the sweet, caramelized onions.  The special this morning was a Schreiner's Sicilian sausage scramble.  It was excellent and I appreciate utilizing local products.    Even though a couple of the tables around me were obviously business appointments, I wouldn't recommend it for two reasons, 1) the wait you can expect, and 2) the noise level makes it hard to conduct a meeting.  This is a good spot, the wait staff is very attentive and friendly.  I have no problem recommending it or returning."}
{"text":"Drove all night and made it here for breakfast.  This looked like the best place it town and I was surprised for a weekday to have a line of people out front waiting.  That just means I found yet another good place with help from Yelpers! Parking was easy and the wait wasn't that long.  The place is smaller than I thought it would be but they were really efficient in taking orders and getting food out quickly so the turn around was pretty fast.  I ordered the scramble special which included hash browns which were fabulous!  The scramble had jalapeños in it and that in itself made it great! It also came with a tortilla which I filled with my leftovers and had as a snack later that day! Hubby got the pancakes which resembled a double layer cake in height and were light and fluffy he said but I knew he'd be out for the count and not driving anymore after that, there was just too much there for one person and he ate them all! My friend got an omelet with the home fries and toast and everything looked and tasted fabulous. I would certainly not hesitate to stop in here again."}
{"text":"Been here three times, really like the food, want to give a good review, but the service is spotty at best, over medium eggs come out Sunnyside up, bill was someone else's, I'm honest so I told them:( quality good, be prepared for only fair service..."}
{"text":"Chili is one step down from Wendy's and about 4 times the cost. Even more regrettable was the service and the 20-min wait to get the said order to-go. In an airport, not making your clients sick and timeliness are probably the top 2 minimum objectives. Customers behind me received their orders sooner, which is not great when the waiting time starts to encroach into your boarding time. The most in-your-face obstinance was the supervisor's insistence that, \"well, we have to heat it up individually.\" Yea, okay, soup can be boiled in like 4 minutes and soondobu can be made from scratch in less than 20 min. So no, uh-uh, no thank you, never again. I'll know better next time."}
{"text":"We purchased two \"Classic Ruben\" sandwiches on the 16th of November 2015 for take-out. Sorry I do not have photos, but my wife gave the second sandwich to the American Airlines stewardess as trash before I could get photos.  What to notice first - despite having many small sealed bags of \"chips,\" Matt's tossed a handful of loose chips in with the sandwich. An hour into our flight, they were all soggy, having lost all crispness. Matt's saved a few cents by dumping in their bulk chips. Shame! Matt's sandwich was premium-priced at about $11.  An excellent Reuben outside the Sky Harbor is in the $6-10 range.  A $11 Ruben should be amazing.  I doubt anyone at this Matt's has ever seen or had a Classic Ruben.  Matt's used bread that was sliced into extra thick 1\" thick slabs.  If it was \"rye,\" the grain was a minority contributor.  The sandwich was cut into two rectangles, like a grade school peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Classic Rubens are cut on a diagonal!  The corned-beef was tough and the quantity very small.  You could hardly taste any sauerkraut or Russian dressing.  Sky Harbor diners from the \"coasts\" should stay away from this atrocity to avoid disappointment. However, we give credit to the \"grill-man\" for getting nice \"grill-marks\" on the bread!"}
{"text":"Meh. My boyfriend and I were starving for brunch so on a recommendation from a friend we went to the Camelback location. We waited 30-40 minutes then were seated....but no one took our drink order for at least 10-12 minutes. We looked at the menu and were shocked-- no variety! Nothing really stood out to us that we had to try. And I'm sorry but $8.45 for two eggs, potatoes and toast? Insane. We ended up paying for my coffee to go and went to Snooze. Way better experience. I'm not likely to try or recommend this place. two stars because at least the food is organic and everyone else seems to enjoy it. I'm just a normal person who wants a good meal at a decent price."}
{"text":"We have been going to Matt's for over 4 years now. Never ordered from the menu - always went for their special of the day and it has always been great. Love the staff...and they move people in and out without feeling rushed. Keep up the great work guys!!!!"}
{"text":"We went there last week because other reviews said it was a great place for breakfast. Glad you think so, I do not. The meal was awful - for both of us. I thought they served the absolute worst hashbrowns I've ever had. Not a place I want to visit twice."}
{"text":"We came here before we went to the SF v Arizona game, we decided to walk from our hotel wow ~ was it hot. I tend to sweat and boy was I melting as we made our way past Arizona State Law School's campus.   The woman who was handling the seating and waiting arrangements did a great job engaging the crowd, despite it being 100 degrees outside their restaurant. It was a Sunday and it seems as though everyone in the historic district had the same idea as we did.   Food was good, came out quickly. Only thing that I was not too happy about was the iced coffee that they offered me and my wife. It seemed too watered down, to a point where my server asked if I wanted more iced tea. Besides that we had a good time service was attentive, Never mind that we were decked out in our best 49er apparel, they still treated us like very nicely.   I had the peppered bacon and the 'world famous' waffle with real maple syrup. (You can really put the words 'world famous' in front of anything.)  Definitely a must if you are in the area and you are looking for a brunch."}
{"text":"The portions here are great! I ordered the chop and chick with a side of bacon. I enjoyed everything I ordered. The toast and jam were very good! My dining partner had ham and sage sausage patties with his order. The sausage patties were outstanding! We weren't impressed with the orange juice. It was too expensive for the quantity and the flavor wasn't impressive. I wouldn't complain about a small glass of OJ whose flavor is out of this world. I will definitely come back. Will try the pancakes and French toast next time."}
{"text":"Cool place, food did not blow me away."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday morning and waited 45 minutes. The menu is small but what we ordered was really good. We ordered a blueberry honey lemonade and a strawberry honey lemonade. The best drinks I've ever had. We got griddle cakes and a scramble that was the special of the day. Best pancakes and syrup I've had and the egg scramble was amazing. Definitely I would come back."}
{"text":"MBB needs to first understand this isn't 5-star fine dining and people are here because THEY ARE FLYING TODAY Unbelievable slow service in an half empty restaurant and no food after 20 minutes from ordering with waiters all standing around talking to one another   People - it's an airport - everyone has somewhere to go  - and I did- I walked out"}
{"text":"I loved this place! It was a short walk from the downtown hotel where I was staying. I think I was about the only person who wasn't a local. Friendly and attentive service. Great food served in generous portions and a good cup of coffee! I will definitely return whenever I have the chance. Left happy and full, ready for the day."}
{"text":"Went in with my girlfriend before work. We are both vegetarians, I asked for no bacon with my waffle and asked if they can sub out hash browns. Server said yes and yet I got two huge ass slices of bacon over my waffle , after I told him we don't eat meat, and charged almost 3 bucks for hash browns. Also was charged for a coffee I didn't order. The server took our order. Brought us our food, and brought us our check. Worst restaurant I've been to. Had no time to even try to argue for my money back."}
{"text":"One of a good reason to not judge first appearance. When my friends took me for brunch to Matt's Big Breakfast, I'm questioning her option, but since we were near this place, I agreed to try this place out. I ordered The Chick and The Chop, they gave option of eggs and I choose my fav scramble eggs. Fries or hashbrown, I choose the fries. And last time to choose my bread. Whole wheat it is! My best option for breakfast drink is always OJ so I ordered one. The OJ came, freshly pure orange juice served in a small cute cup with chicken logos. It was superb! Although the cup is small and I swore I can chug the OJ in 3secs but it still worth it! The porkchop was excellent! My whole wheat bread was thick and tasty! My scrambled eggs and fries were perfect! And last but not least, the additional bacon that I ordered was great! The only complaint that I have for this place is just the service. My waitress was too busy talking with 2 college guys customer that over-flirt her so she forgot we already gave her our card and wait for almost 45 minutes just to finish the payment. Overall, I will definitely be back for my superb breakfast but hopefully I will get a fast service next time ;))"}
{"text":"They are the biggest and one of the better looking among the modest restaurants in Terminal 4 B gates. The big pig on the wall with the retro typeface tries to subvert the overwhelming and inescapable airport food court vibe.   The waitress was friendly and the service was prompt.  I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato soup. The cheese was just tasteless and the soup was more salty than if it had come out of a can. I asked for coffee to go and it was barely lukewarm - made me think if the service was really as genuine as you can expect at an airport eatery.  I will remember this place enough to not go there the next time I fly to Vegas through that airport."}
{"text":"Love quick, delicious breakfast? The portion sizes at Matt's quite satisfactory and I usually go for \"lighter\" menu like biscuit sandwich. The downtown location is not too far from my work and has a very cozy atmosphere. Just like most breakfast places, they have a bar for people to sit at."}
{"text":"Nothing like a five spot sandwich after the Farmer's Market!! Still super tasty ...I don't mind the wait ... it's that tasty!"}
{"text":"Terrible service terrible food. The fresh squeeze Oj is not freshly squeezed at all. Food is super slow. I asked the waitress to check on my food since I have a flight to catch. Her attitude was if u don't have dont don't eat here"}
{"text":"Ordered the chop and chick and was not disappointed! SO GOOD! I am a hash browns girl through and through but was advised to try the home fries. No regrets! Those home fries are the best I've ever had! The wheat toast is delicious and the homemade strawberry preserves are worth the wait in line. And you must order the blueberry honey lemonade!"}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast is AWESOME The food is great, great retro-atmosphere and the staff is very attentive and friendly.  Centrally located and very easy to get to by the Light Rail or plenty of parking in the rear."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from long beach california for this joint, and it was totally worth the drive. I got the waffle with bacon and a side of of rosemary potatoes. it was amazing and the best breakfast i have ever eaten. Every time i go to AZ i will eat here amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I was here the other day and it was a great hangover cute. However their omelette did not have a lot of flavour and the hash-browns needed a lot of salt. It was alright on the whole, the atmosphere and wait staff were great but I expected a more flavourful meal. It's decent but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I go back to matts big breakfast always expecting something better because of all the rave reviews but frankly I'm always disappointed.   I love breakfast food, and you'd think a breakfast place would be able to cook eggs to order right? Nope. Every time I've gone the eggs are over easy, I like over medium, and I've even tried asking for over hard, still over easy. I always ask for bacon extra crispy and it still comes out kinda soggy every time. The eggs Benedict I've had before and again the eggs weren't cooked enough. The hash is fine, and the lemonade is pretty good but if I'm paying that much for breakfast at a place with breakfast in the name...you'd think they could cook an egg how you want it...   Log story short, not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Stopped in while driving to Cali...wanted a wholesome solid breakfast.  This place did not disappoint!!   I got eggs Benedict with home fries. My daughter had a Belgian waffle and my mom had a veggie omelet.  All were so yummy! The home fries were prob the best I've had- crispy, flavorful, fresh and lots of onions and peppers. The bread used for toast was legit artisan bread. So good and hearty.  Only complaint: they didn't have half and half for coffee! Had to use almond milk or regular whole milk. But they did have the raw sugar and the coffee was fantastic.  Restrooms were clean too!!"}
{"text":"If you're in the area and you have a small party, give it a shot.  It'll be good not great.    I love breakfast so I'd combed the Internet for breakfast joints to visit while in Phoenix.  Matt's Big Breakfast was near the top of the list.    Finally made it there today with my mom - not the most adventurous eater but game for a good experience.  She was turned off by the flies and the heat inside the restaurant but did enjoy her tuna sandwich and potato chips.  The tuna was tasty - light, not too soggy, not too much relish or add-ins.  It tasted pretty fresh and the bread was delicious - definitely not just out of a plastic bag.  The chips were a little cool but the pepper was a nice addition.  I've read complaints about the coffee and I'd agree it wasn't that good.  Not awful but if you're open to other beverages I'd say grab something else when you're there.  I had two eggs over easy, whole grain toast, and hash browns.  The hash browns were some of the greasiest I've ever eaten (and I eat a lot of hash browns) but at least we're dealing with real butter and olive oil at this place.  The potatoes are grated really fine which perhaps adds to your ability to see all the grease.  They were greasy but tasty.  Still, the home fries on a plate nearby looked equally, if not, more tasty.  The eggs were fine and the bread was delicious. I had to order everything a la carte because the only two egg breakfast on the menu involved bacon.    There are mostly 2 seater tables though they can pull up an extra chair to some of the tables but if you've got a larger party, prepare to wait. There's also counter space for people who are open to sitting at the counter.  If you go around 1:30 pm, there's definitely no wait! :)  The service was friendly though not particularly helpful."}
{"text":"As a food lover, I don't ever get the \"lighter\" versions of food at restaurants, but Matt's Skinny sounded great and it was great!   First off, let me say, bottomless coffee for a little less than $3 - that's a steal! But off to the food, I got their Skinny, which is a four egg whites scramble with spinach, applewood chicken sausage, and a side salad. No skimping on flavors, but still light and actually very large!  On the side, I got their house made toast (sourdough, wheat, or rye) with also, house made, strawberry preserves. Huge, full strawberries, I tell ya.   Did not fail to impress at all!"}
{"text":"I think this is the BEST breakfast, not only in Scottsdale, but of anywhere I've ever gone!  The food tastes so fresh, and everything is delicious.  There service is great, and they have a very good thing going here!  Wish we had one in Houston, TX!!"}
{"text":"So it begins....I have finally started reviewing all the restaurants that I tried on my tour of the Southwest this summer and Matt's Big Breakfast was a BIG way to start it off!  Being from LA which seems to be the home of trendy but good and always crowded breakfast spots, I understand the love/hate relationship that people have with their local breakfast spot that have just become way to crowded.  That being said, I left LA to try some of the favorites in other cities.  The good thing about being on vacation is that you can schedule your meals around the crowds instead of dealing with them.  So we drove into Phoenix around 11pm under the blanket of the night which was great because the days were reaching 120 degrees.  It was quieter then most cities, almost ghost-town like.  We stayed at the motel next to Matt's Big Breakfast.  I think its called the Coronado or Casablanca Hotel.  It was more of a Motel then Hotel and definitely not the Holiday Inn.  Although a little on the scary side it served its purpose.  The goal was to wake up and walk into Matt's.  And that goal was certainly achieved.    After a super long wait of about...3 minutes (9:30am) we sat down and took a look at the menu.    http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y143/skptk13/DSCF1410-1.jpg  It wasnt as big as I thought it was going to be (haha)...well, it wasnt as expansive as I thought it was going to be but I would rather restaurants do what they do right instead of tons of things done wrong.  I got the Hog & Chick and Griddle Cakes.  Thick cut bacon and perfectly made eggs with delicious potatoes.  Nice thick bread and homemade jam came along side.  Im not a fan of citrus jams/preserves but this was fantastic!  http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y143/skptk13/DSCF1415.jpg  http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y143/skptk13/DSCF1417.jpg  The pancakes were possibly the best of the trip and also some of the best I have ever had.  Everything we had was great!   Our server/owner  even came and talked to us about our trip, the town and even gave us some other suggestions on places to see and eat at while in Phoenix.  I wish I could have tried some of the places she suggested but...alas, we still had a ton of places still on our own list.    Off to Joe's Farm Grill!!!"}
{"text":"OVERRATED.  I know it was reviewed on Food network channel as top 10 something or another in the nation.  Did their quality go down since they know that people will seek it out irregardless of the review?  Location- in down town Phoenix- but in a crappy part that doesn't look safe at night.  Dirt lot in back is not an option to park because of city ordinances or safety issues.  Wait time- for those reviewers who waited over 1hour in the hot desert sun- i don't know what to say. There is little to no shade, it's hot, you lean on wooden fences... it's a strange system where you sign your name to be called. However, if you sign in, and say you want to go do something else instead of wait an hour in the hot sun, they will cross you off the list if you aren't there for roll call. Some people behind us, just waited a bit then walked in and sat at the bar (where they were seating other people).  And they say they don't play favorites?  Please....  If you can't stand to wait, you can  order take out and get your food before all the other people waiting.  Do they let anyone know? NO. Do they care that people waiting over 1 hour have to wait another hour for food so To-Go people can get their food? NO...  Food- maybe the food tastes better because your out in the hot sun,dehydrating, standing, waiting... because the food didn't look like anything special and didn't taste special either.  Just run of the mill breakfast food.  Does it take 45min to make waffles and toast?  We told them we had a flight to catch, and our food took a crazy amount of time to make. No wonder the wait is so long outside! 2oz of OJ was $2.50  Ambiance- it's a 3 room (1 kitchen, one bar set up, 1 room with 4 tables and seating on bar-like thing looking outside. Think they can seat ~20 people inside?  Poor decor, crappy furniture.... they must make a ton of money because none of it is going into the location/upkeep/decor.  Don't even think about coming here with more than 6 people.... Where will you put them? Wait til the restaurant clears so you have a room to yourself?  ha...  Once again, OVER-RATED."}
{"text":"After hearing how great Matt's Big Breakfast was, some friends and I decided to give it a try.  Boy, was I not impressed.  The menu is VERY limited and disappointing.  I wasnt too impressed with the food at all.  I ended up ordering a waffle.  It came with bacon, which was so burnt I didnt eat it.  The waffle was \"ok\", nothing to write home about.  My dining partners had a reuben sandwich and a chicken sandwich, both of which they said were good.  The ONLY redeeming quality about our visit was the staff--everyone was very friendly and offered a smile.  I still havent figured what is so BIG about Matt's Breakfast, and after our visit, I dont intend on finding out."}
{"text":"This place is great, hard to get a table, but the owners are fantastic, and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins to find out the girl was skipping me on the waiting list. She said she wasn't skipping me, that there were places for two people to sit, but not one. The last time I checked, one person is able to sit where two people can sit. I don't give a pretty fuck that you are trying to turn more tables, if I am waiting 30 mins, when it's my turn, ITS MY TURN. If someone that came after me, sits before I do, you are skipping me. There is no arguing with me about it. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I came here a couple weeks ago while passing through Phoenix, and it was delicious! As mentioned before, there is a bit of a wait. However, we just walked around a little bit and explored the area, and pleasantly, there was no pressure by the servers to turn over tables once we were seated. The venue itself is small, but beautiful. The windows were large and filled with natural light making it seem open and spacious.  The food was also really good. While the salami scramble didn't particularly suit my taste, they had crispy hashbrowns and freshly made cherry jam to go with the toast-- both were above and beyond. I'll definitely be back next time in town."}
{"text":"Food isn't that bad, it was my third time going as it was conveniently close to my gym. The way I was treated by the manager however was very surprising. We had a group of 6 waiting to get seated for breakfast. We asked the host when we could be seated and she told us about 25 or 30 minutes. Then the manager came by and aggressively said we probably won't be seated for about 40 minutes. This was understandable since it was a busy Saturday morning. After about 10 minutes seats at the bar became available and I asked the host if we could just sit there, she said yes so we did. After sitting down the manager yells across the restaurant asking what we're doing and yelling that we couldn't sit there. I was a bit defensive as the host said we could. Then the manager made a bit of a scene and came over and kicked us out of the bar using a very patronizing tone saying we had to wait like everyone else even though the host said we could sit there. Even the employee behind the bar seemed confused as to why we couldn't sit there. Anyway, the manager didn't even give us a reason why we couldn't, so we all left hungry, and angry at his behavior. My advice is to make customer service a priority and not patronize customers. I usually write positive reviews and maybe he's usually cool, but this guy was acting like ass hole."}
{"text":"I really think this is the BEST BREAKFAST I have ever had!  The 3 times I have eaten here it has been an hour and a half wait!  Other than that I would give it 5 stars...Food is great, staff is friendly"}
{"text":"Moma Mia love Big Mat and his Big Breakfast.  This guy knows good food and keeps an eagle eye on staff and quality to make sure all is up to snuff.  No wonder his other locations and Giant Coffee remain in the Snacksters permanent rotation."}
{"text":"Awesomeness from Matt pool yet again.  Packed to the rafters with egg and bacon lovers....plus much much more!  This place is equally as cool as the downtown location skewing a tad older and a tad less hip but that doesn't make us any less hungry or appreciative of great food.  Thanks Matt for making it over here!"}
{"text":"Long waits are worth it! I suggest a party of 2 if you can make it happen, just because when you smell the delicious things coming out of the restaurant, you are not going to want to wait for a table to open for a big party!   Local, fresh, and unique dishes that make home style breakfasts im used to with local flair such as AZ grown fruits and veggies or thick cut peppered bacon. Not to mention the REAL fresh squeezed orange juice.   Servers are hit or miss. Last visit I had a gal completely forget to put our order in for about 20 minutes, but the kitchen is fast so it wasn't more than 15 minutes after she did that we had our food.   No real complaints, Matt's food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. My only real complaint would be to not go with a group and expect to pay separately... they don't split checks which is ridiculous. There was only four of us and it was too difficult for them to split the bill. We thought it was just the server the first time we went but same thing happened the second time too. They said their software wasn't capable. We then asked them to pretend we each were a table of one; they still couldn't figure that one out. Sorry but not everyone can afford to front the bill and expect their friends to remember to get cash out and pay them back.  They also charge you almost $2 for an extra tiny bottle of syrup. That better be straight from a maple tree grown in the back of the restaurant, haha!"}
{"text":"This place has the dullest menu, the most common food imaginable, and terrible atmosphere - at very high prices. The food isn't bad, but there's nothing to it - a burger, a Ruben, tuna salad sandwich... really? This isn't anything special -except the prices. Tuna salad sandwich with chips, which was no better than I make at home, for $13.00. Seriously, forget what you may have seen on TV, which is someone trying to find something interesting to makeTV, go somewhere that has better food - which isn't hard at all to find."}
{"text":"I love this place, even though it moved a while back. I liked the coziness of the original smaller venue, but the food is still awesome and unique."}
{"text":"I don't think I have anything to share that hasn't already been posted in previous reviews.  The food here is stellar - quality ingredients, great flavor, and nothing cookie-cutter. The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. Service is friendly, quick, and everything one should expect.  I absolutely love visiting this place and encourage you to do so, as well, if you haven't already. I am one of the lucky ones who has never had to wait more than 60 seconds for a table - I'm not sure how that's worked out, but it has, and I'm grateful. That said, I would gladly wait an hour to enjoy some great breakfast fare at Matt's. I'm looking forward to trying lunch one day, too!"}
{"text":"People have been raving about this place to me for the past five years.  I finally made it.  I could smell fresh  hashbrowns and pancakes cooking in the parking lot.  The pancakes were great, the hashbrowns were made to perfections.  The food is wholesome for the most part.  I ordered the special which was sausage and spinach.  The eggs were too buttery and watered down.  This was probably do to the fact the spinach was cooked down with too much fluids.  Instead of flipping the eggs so they were fluffy it appeared as the cooked took the end of the spatula and chopped the eggs.  Big mistake.  Orange juice was nice and fresh.  Overall is was not a bad meal but not the hype people made it up to be.  I met the owner who was very very nice.  She seemed to know how her food was cooked.  I just wish she looked at my plate before it went out.  The wait staff was not overly friendly and seemed a little blah for being a Monday morning.  Over all it was ok but not worth waiting in a long line like they normally have.  There are plenty of other places who will do a mediocre job and have better waitstaff."}
{"text":"Been to Matt's one time and that is enough for me to know this place is one of a Kind.  From the awesome friendly service, to the amazing meals, to the distinctly delicious honey lemonade and FRESHLY squeezed OJ, to the Fresh flowers on the table, Its truly a place I hope to make a habit of!"}
{"text":"So for being featured on DDD, I expected a little more than what I got to be honest.  We arrived on a Sunday morning at 8:15 and waited a half hour, which I was fully expecting from the other reviews.  I was underwhelmed by the limited menu but understand that it has to be that way to turn the tables as fast as they need to in order to accommodate the crowd waiting outside.  My omelet was alright and my husband got the salami scramble which he did enjoy.  The sourdough toast, homemade jam and fragrant squeezed OJ was what I enjoyed the most.  I would recommend to visitors but honestly don't know if I would continue to come here and wait as a regular."}
{"text":"I was told so much about Matts big breakfast by friends and colleges before I made a months long work trip out to Phoenix. My wife and family ended up visiting my last week there so we checked this place out! Crazy long line and crazy long wait but once we got in service was quick and smooth customer service great! If you're looking for good food that is just simple and tasty and reasonably priced this is the place for you! Just get there as early as possible because that is by far one of the biggest and longest lines I've ever been in!"}
{"text":"I'm sure you're asking how good can breakfast be? At Matt's it's the little things that count. Instead of giving you a piece of bread from a bag they give you a huge piece of fresh baked bread with real butter and homemade preserves. The organic eggs they use to make breakfast taste amazing and the syrup here puts Aunt Jemima to shame! Want to avoid the horrible wait everyone talks about? At Matt's the early bird gets the worm. Arrive between 6am-8am and you won't have to wait."}
{"text":"This is probably the only place I will eat at alone. The staff is so courteous, you don't feel like you're surrounded by strangers or uncomfortable.  Anyway, the food. That's what you wanna know about, right? I mean you're still reading sooo.  I've had a few things on the menu here. The Waffle, is incredible. I wish my vocabulary was better because I'm sure there's a word better than incredible. I also recommend the coffee, it's so damn good - im an avid coffee drinker. The bacon is large and thick, it's cooked perfectly and seasoned with crushed peppercorn, but in all honesty, I'm not a fan. Dunno why, can't explain it. The servings are huge and definitely a bargain for how inexpensive they are. The hash-browns aren't my favorite. They're crispy on the outside and soggy on the inside, but I guess it's just preference."}
{"text":"The first time I went here I thought it was a good Yelp pick.  The last time I went here I shelled out $18 for a scramble without meat, and a large OJ.  If you come here with a party of four your tab would be close to $80.  $4.50 for a large OJ that was probably bought at Costco for $5 a gallon!?  Food is good, but not worth the high cost  and wait considering the location is in an industrial area.  I have been to hundreds of restaurants world-wide and know what is a reasonable cost for your meal.  Diners and Dives made it popular, but now I think they are gouging the customer for their product.  Cashier tried to justify costs, but the #s just don't add up."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delish: waffles (is it malt in them? Idk, but it's great), bacon, the daily special with home fries and hashbrowns. Service was great. Only complaint is that most the seating are 2 seater tables. My party of 3 was squeezed onto a 2 seater, but... the food was so yummy I'd do it again anytime!"}
{"text":"One and a half hour wait. Cement floors make this place louder than an active warehouse. Waitstaff was present for the order and dropoff but you have to beg for refills on coffee or cokes. Food was OK but heavy on the a la carte pricing and for breakfast, which makes a big margin, I found it expensive for basic fare."}
{"text":"Another DDD try, we had to come here twice. The first time it was just to crowded. Glad we came back. I really enjoyed the daily special, which changes every day. Also enjoyed the waffles. Wife and daughter enjoyed the usual eggs and hashbrowns. Very friendly service would come again!"}
{"text":"The breakfast was delicious! Decor was cute and the people were VERY nice and friendly. I wanted badly to give this place a 5 star rating but what was terribly annoying was the noise level!!! We could hardly converse with our family at the table. Unfortunately the acoustics at this location need attention badly....."}
{"text":"Matts was recommended to us by some friends who are well familiar with the Phoenix area. apparently they have a few locations. This one is at Phoenix Sky Harbor airport (we were waiting for a flight). If you are at the airport and need a meal, you can't go wrong here.   We ordered the waffles, and a \"Hog & Chick\" (Two eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes). Fresh OJ to boot. I enjoyed the Hog&chick but the waffles are a better choice. Overall, not the greatest breakfast I have ever had, but for an airport, it's decent.  I have heard that the other locations are better. When I am back in town, I will try them."}
{"text":"A lot of hype around this place and they lived up to it! I had the salami omelet and was tasty. Their homemade jelly was so good. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Well, the Yelp black hole strikes again! Wife, daughter, and myself ate here about six years ago. This was before we moved to the valley. What I can remember about this place, very small, limited seating, had to wait outside in the heat. With that said, food was great, service was very good. I had pancakes, OJ, I could remember daughter loved the eggs, bacon, and potatoes. I wife enjoyed the food also. Haven't been back, because how small it is. But as much I am at the airport. I have been to that location a few times."}
{"text":"I love Matt's big breakfast. I don't go there all the time. But any place that makes me drive a pretty good distance and wait in line just for breakfast! Must be doing something right. Went there this morning with my girlfriend. And we was greeted by a cute and very intelligent kid that was the owners son. Didn't have to wait to long but it was a nice day. I always get the griddlecakes when I go there. Ive never had anything even close to there's anywhere else. I can't give it 5 stars because of the wait and because its pretty small in there. And its always kind of weird eating breakfast next to a big window where people who are waiting outside can sit there and stare at you. I feel like im on display at a zoo eating. But those are minor gripes. I go to Matts for the food and the food never disappoints."}
{"text":"Another Yelp score for me. I stayed downtown and did a search. It wasn't far from the hotel so we walked over. The area was not looking like there'd be a highly rated food place but bang, there it was. Nothing overly fancy from the outside but man the food does not disappoint. There's a decent selection on the menu and the prices are very reasonable.  No matter what you order, try the thick cut bacon. It's excellent."}
{"text":"I'm going to sum up my own experiences and some Pros and Cons for people from reviews already posted, to give people a good starting information point.  I had the Chop and Chick.  It was great.  If you like breakfast pork chops, this one is top of the line.  The breads and jellies are great too.  The hash browns, crispy and buttery.  What I did not like is getting FLAT OUT RIPPED OFF with the TINY, TINY glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice they offer for $2.50.  I mean it's literally only about 3-4 ounces.  Tiny.  Grossly overpriced.  It's like they priced it like that to DISSUADE people from buying it.  Hate this about Matt's.  Pros:  Fresh, local ingredients, well-prepared and tasty. Many people say this is the best restaurant breakfast they have had, or among the best. People LOVE the buttery, crisp hash browns, and the home fries get a lot of praise also. Although the wait can be long, many people say it's totally worth it.  Cons: The wait can be soul-crushingly long.  The place is TINY. Stupidly overpriced orange juice. Fresh-squeezed, but JEEZ !!! Tiny parking lot also.  So, ingest all that info, and decide if Matt's is for you.    Happy Yelping !!!"}
{"text":"Num num num its Bacon. Great breakfast. I had the waffle with Bacon and sausage. I saw this place on DDD and had to make the trip.  It was really busy and they do not have a lot of seating so be prepared to wait 15 - 20 mins on the weekend.  It doesn't sound like much but I went there early and hungry.  A must for Breakfast when you are in the area."}
{"text":"Oh, this place was worth the wait. My friends and I got there at 10:30AM and the wait was about 45min. Thankfully there was a farmers market across the street to keep me busy.   Matt's was very small and there were no bathrooms inside of building. Strange floor plan. I ordered a Cheese Omelet with peppers and ham, coffee, and OJ. The coffee was heavenly...it was what I've been looking for all morning. The OJ was surprisingly tiny...the glass was as tall my fingers, but it was very fresh. The omelet came with a side of home fries or hash browns and bread. I HIGHLY recommend the home fries, which is chopped potatoes cooked with onions and rosemary. I got the wheat bread which was delicious. This is not your typical plain/thin wheat toast!  The omelet was huge and so were the ingredients. The peppers which I thought was be sprinkled in like most places was actually a whole sauteed pepper. The ham was smokey and thick. The serving was pretty good for a $10 breakfast.   Overall, I think Matt's is superior to other popular breakfast joint such as the Breakfast Club or Orange Table. It was worth the wait, but I'll definitely be more strategic regarding the timing the next time around."}
{"text":"Solid food.  Pancakes are super fluffy and tasty.  The maple syrup is incredible.  Fresh oj yes! Really friendly staff. Will repeat."}
{"text":"Everyone knows that Matt's is one of the must-go places in Phoenix for breakfast, which is demonstrated by the long lines on the weekends and the rants and raves from out-of-towners.   The food is fantastic! I have never had a bad meal and the service is top notch. I love breakfast food, and Matt's knows exactly what they are doing!  However, I'm not sure I completely understand the popularity. I only go during the week because while its good, its not \"waiting outside for an hour\" good. There are a lot of great places in Phoenix for breakfast that are right in line with Matt's.   Don't get me wrong, if you pass by and there isn't a line, by all means get in there and get some bacon. But if there is too long of a line, walk a few blocks to Phoenix Public Cafe."}
{"text":"So yeah. Phoenix's favorite breakfast spot was a little disappointing. I would not recommend the home fries because they taste more like boiled potatoes nor would I suggest the pork chop due to it being undercooked  & flavorless.   It gets three stars because the toast and homemade preserves are to DIE for and they have awesome hash browns.   Would I give them another shot? Perhaps. Their prices are amazing. It could've been a bad day but I see potential."}
{"text":"You know how sometimes you hear about how good a place is so much that by the time you try it the hype is so high the place can't possibly meet your expectations? Well this is not that place. Matt's delivers on everything you have heard (sadly this includes the wait).  Matt's is basically your favorite local breakfast spot on steroids. Rather than a run of the mill piece of bacon it's a thick cut peppered slice cooked to perfection, that is from the Pork Shop (see my review on them) in Queen Creek.  The eggs? Yeah they are awesome.  On a recent trip I went and got the Chop and chick which was a couple of great eggs coupled with a slap of pork that was not only gigantic but super flavorful. The hash browns are about as perfect as hash browns can be crispy outside but not burned and great potato goodness inside.  The coffee here was also really good and exactly what a cup of regular old coffee should be.  Service was great and they are very quick to make sure you are taken care of. The prices are right in line with what they should be especially for the quality of the food.  Only thing is be prepared for a wait if you here as they are pretty busy especially on the weekends. But you are welcome to go inside and grab a cup of coffee while you wait."}
{"text":"Keep in mind, any time you're dining at the Airport, there are going to be some expensive prices that you'd definitely reconsider elsewhere. This is the case here. A burger and a drink (lemonade) cost $18.72 prior to the tip. Yikes! This is not \"horrible\" but at the same time it is higher than what I would have valued the food at.   Steak fries seemed to be prepackaged. Burger was \"just ok.\" My friend asked what it would cost to add jalapenos to her burger and was told 2$ -- deary me, that was a no go, and put a bad taste in our mouths.   Service was slow on getting the food out. The server, however, was somewhat apologetic about it. All in all is was just an average/ok experience."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this Phoenix institution for years and finally, on vacation, got to go. It lives up to its excellent reputation. I had the Salami Scramble, my son had the Chop & Chick. Both were superb. Service was quick and very friendly. Food fresh and delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is so popular? How do they have three locations?  These questions boggle my mind.  We ordered the bloody mary after seeing a picture on yelp.  I am always looking for bloodies with fun garnishes.  This one looked fun!  Every garnish was meh.  The cheese seemed like it was going bad, the olives were drying out and the pickle was the worst pickle probably in the history of pickling.  I love pickles! How does one make a mediocre pickle?  I did not think it was possible.  The best garnish was the celery LOL.  Oh, and the bacon was so yuck!  Moving on to the bloody mary.  Nothing special at all.  I ordered a veggie omelette with cheddar.  It was good.  I have had better omelettes.  It wasn't fluffy and the veggies were somewhat greasy.  My sweets had a burger and said it was overcooked and there was nothing special about it.  Like I said, I have no clue what is so special about this place.  All in all don't eat here expecting a fresh over the top delish breakfast.  Expect average truck stop food pretending to be something worth talking about."}
{"text":"The first few times I went to Matt's was at the old location and I instantly fell in love.  Cozy, friendly staff and bomb a$$ food! I mean that bacon, come on!   Everything I ate was always delicious and I loved that everything was made fresh and bought local, it shows in the quality even if it is only breakfast.    Unfortunately I wasn't so impressed with the food at their new location.  Maybe I just went on an off day?! Brought a few friends with me too who have never been and got tired of me raving about the food.  Sad to say that none of them were impressed and a few said they'd probably never go back :(    Please Matt, if you have changed anything since switching locations please stop! I loved you so very much before and now it may be a while before returning again....maybe"}
{"text":"Hanging out here before our red eye flight. Cydnie was amazing!!! If you are ever in terminal B, stop in! She's friendly, warm, funny, and kind.  Airports can be nerve wracking but she's such a treasure!  Drinks were great too!!"}
{"text":"Too trendy for it's own damn good. They refused to split a check. I really didn't experience anything that isn't available elsewhere with less hype."}
{"text":"Fun Bloody Mary,but  not the best tasting .I Will say I am a bit of a Bloody Mary snob I love the ones that you don't want to smile after you take a drink because your teeth will be full of stuff packed full of spices and goodies ... with that being said the salt around the rim was amazing nice smoky spicy flavor. The cheese was a new twist and it worked good it was a nice cheese. the olives were subpar as was the cucumber.( one cucumber looked old or once frozen and the other one was sooooo very salty and I love salt but couldn't eat this one.. AND IT COSTS  $15.00 EACH.."}
{"text":"Really cute spot. Breakfast here was great (and definitely big). The rosemary potatoes were pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"This was the FIRST place we ever ate once moving to the phoenix area. I had read many good reviews about it and that it was a MUST try. So we went around 9am on a Saturday. There was obviously a wait since it is a tiny but popular restaurant. So we waited outside for like half hour. But it was pleasant outside and we didn't mind.  Once in, we got French toast and waffles. And they brought out some great jams/jellies as well. The food was excellent. You could tell this place spends time on each dish and making sure it is perfectly cooked.  Great spot!!"}
{"text":"Color me shocked. I didn't have high expectations for a place in an airport, now I feel like airports are going to be held to a whole new standard. I opted for a Bloody Mary - which hands down is one of the best I have ever had. A small meal in itself. I also went for an omelette with a side of potatoes. Those potatoes, so delicious. Well seasoned with rosemary, crispy on the outside, and perfectly soft on the inside. Paul was an amazing bartender. Hope my flights are all out of this terminal whenever I am in AZ!"}
{"text":"Do not expect to feel like Dennys here.  It is a busy little mom and pop shop that produces some of the best breakfast food in town.  Everything tasted amazing and the portion size was almost too large.  The price was very fair for what I consider the best quality around.  My waitress Maritza was great as well.    I highly recommend this business to friends and family."}
{"text":"Ohmergawd I love the pancakes. I love it enough to wait in line and think its perfectly OK to stand outside in the AZ summer for it. The staff is polite and courteous to a fault. The wait, admittedly is the worst part. However they do have a water dispenser and benches for you while you wait and if you are willing to sit at the bar the wait really isn't that bad. They do use locally sourced cartel coffee and not any of that burnt junk from *sucks so that's an instant win. The coffee refills are pretty much limitless and they keep em comin' which given the amount of coffee I tend to drink is an awesome thing. They even offer to get you a to go cup if you wanted to get coffee to go after you are done eating.   Sure it is tight quarters and it is noisy but none of that is why i docked a star. I wasn't even done eating and my tab was at my table. I didn't ask for it, it just came up. That I thought was lame and hence the 4 stars. Not sure what the deal was but whatever.. i'll still go back.. those pancakes... mmm...yummy !"}
{"text":"Ok, I am still dreaming about the fluffy, buttery pancakes I had during my last trip to AZ during Spring Training. Drooling now, as I think about it.   Besides the pancakes, everything else is pretty spot on. The chick and chop - delicious, tender, subtle herb seasoning pork chop w/ eggs on the side. The hashbrowns? Off the hook! Buttery and crispy. Bacon? OMG. Perfectly shaped, and wonderfully crisp.   And the service, for being as busy as it is, they make you feel right at home. Sure, the manager checks in with you towards the end, so she can gauge when you will leave the table, but it still felt genuine. Made us feel right at home, like a regular \"veteran\" - despite really only visiting once a year on our Spring Training trips.   See you next year, Matt. See you soon (but not soon enough)."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place when the first one opened, but I don't do lines. Now that there are more of them I decided to try them. There was no line and not many people in the restaurant. My touchstone is biscuits and gravy, if you can't make those good, you probably can't make anything good.  I had their biscuits and gravy (Tuesday only). The first thing I noticed was that they were very spicy, I like spicy, the wife does not. I like a lot of sausage in my gravy, they had that. I likes me some good biscuits, these were ok. The thing I did not like was that there was not quite enough gravy to finish the biscuits. The eggs I ordered were exactly how I wanted them, the hash browns were pretty good, crispy on the outside kind of like mashed potatoes on the inside.  The did not have salsa. I like salsa on my hash browns. I tried their bacon since everyone raves about it. I would not call it bacon. Bacon has a smoky flavor, their bacon is peppered and because of that tasted like very tender beef jerky."}
{"text":"My brother and I came from out of town and saw the reviews on yelp so decided to make the trip. Best decision ever. Great service and great atmosphere but the food put it over the top. It's hard to differentiate yourself when it comes to breakfast but Matt's makes it happen. Butcher shop bacon, perfectly cooked steak and eggs, home fries that will knock your socks off. Even the toast was off the charts. Best breakfast place I've ever been too. Well worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"I don't feel like my visit here really compared to all the hype online! The ambience and way the room is set up is very strange. All the tables seem to be crowded, facing different directions and the seating is not comfortable. When my friends and I walked in we were told to seat ourselves and we were greeted by 3 different servers on separate occasions so it was very unorganized. The menu was underwhelming and the food was just decent. Wouldn't be my first choice for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Cheese omelet: Potatoes were very tasty, but greasy (and I'm fine with some grease in my homefries). Good whole grain bread in the toast, but disappointing that there was no butter. Omelet overcooked, but much worse was that the cheddar cheese was chewy & stringy--somehow badly overcooked, which is difficult to do in an omelet. Very slow (albeit friendly) service, too--not good in an airport restaurant."}
{"text":"My question is, if the portions were not so huge would people still be giving this greasy spoon 5 stars. I guess if you are very simple in your tastes you could give this place five stars. It is breakfast with nothing special about it except for the names on the menu.   I figured it out, everybody is so goo-goo over it because its trendy! O wait maybe its because you wait outside for so long that you are even more hungover and so famished by the time you get in there that a goat turd would taste good. One more theory, the taste of the coffee made the food taste delicious.   Matt is very popular in the central Phoenix area so word spread like wild fire and he has been incredibly successful by serving good quality typical greasy spoon food, and I do think it is as simple as that."}
{"text":"Overrated, but if you are a downtowner it's a \"thing.\" Don't get me wrong, it's good and you should probably decide to go once if you live in Phoenix to get to know the culture. By the time you wait to get seated in the mico diner you could have cooked up 5 course breakfast and three pots of coffee!"}
{"text":"To preface I really enjoy when a restaurant has a nice ambiance, vibe, and awesome location. I love this is love located right next to Tempe town lake. With that said I got the salami scrambler and it really really turned me off. The service was average, and the only thing making me go back and try something new is the location and the way that the restaurant looks and feels."}
{"text":"The service was quick and excellent. I ordered the ham breakfast sandwich thing but was surprised that it wasn't an actual sandwich. They give you the bread on the side and you basically have to assemble the sandwich yourself which is impossible because the ham is HUGE! Not complaining because it lives up to its name, it's a damn big breakfast! I enjoyed the choice of sourdough, white or wheat bread which i chose wheat. Their honey lemonade is to die for !!! The eggs were eggs, I mean who can mess that up?! The hashbrowns however were terrible. Something off about the taste and they were incredibly soggy on the bottom! There's crazy road construction outside of this location so it's hard to hard and navigate to get to it. Their griddle cakes are amazing, good flavor to them and they are huge and fluffy ! Couldn't eat but just a bite"}
{"text":"Our family enjoys eating breakfast at MBB's, the food is delicious and the staff are very attentive. However, we have noticed recently that management has been very unprofessional and sometimes lacking sincerity. Not a good look for a wonderful place..."}
{"text":"Ordered a Bloody Mary at the airport. It had a meal with it! (Bacon, cheese, olives, pickles) Tasted great. However, was treated rather rudely by the waitress when trying to engage her to ask if I were to order a second, if they had one without all the food. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Simple menu and great food.  Totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now and it is like coming home. I am greeted by name and the food is always great. The owners use local farm ingredients and I feel good supporting local people instead of a nameless, faceless chain restaurant."}
{"text":"The scrambled eggs with chorizo are absolutely delicious. The waitress is very hot.. very friendly service. Love the vibe!"}
{"text":"Quality and quantity. Come with an appetite. Always seems busy but the service is still pretty quick."}
{"text":"I've been to Matt's a bunch of times when it was the small house on the corner and now at it's larger location. On the weekends there always seems to be a huge line. At least now they have more seating.   The food has always been great, but the line is always way too long. When we were there last, people were piling into the cashier area waiting inside because of the warm weather. They packed into the restaurant and crowded around us at the front counter. I definitely didn't like the feeling of people hovering over us while we ate. Some were even rude enough to be leaning on the counter that we were eating on. Overall not an enjoyable experience.  I like the overall vibe of the restaurant and the food, but because of the lines, I'd opt for another breakfast spot. The Valley has plenty of other amazing breakfast/brunch spots."}
{"text":"Yup this is it! Came back from Canada and 1st place I had to hit was Matt's! Always take my out of towners here!"}
{"text":"To be fair, we went to Matt's based on the raveswe read on various sources.  Like the emperpr's new clothes, we fail to see what the hubbub is all about. I recently went to breakfast there and order a cheese omelet with home fries and wnet away hungry and very disappointed.  The home fries were mostly uncooked and badly seasoned,  The eggs were hard and disappointing and the toast was hard and cold.  This was very unsatisfactory and it is certain that Matt's Breakfast lives off its laurels and not the food."}
{"text":"I couldn't think of one thing wrong with this place or  with the service. It was my first time here and I actually had my puppy with me. The employees were so friendly. I got the blt and I was so impressed. The bacon is absolutely amazing. I gave this place five stars because I honestly didn't have any problems at all. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a nice environment and good food."}
{"text":"I loved Matts! We went around 7:30am and there was no wait, it was full but tables for two available! Short and to the point menu but still hard to choose because everything sounds great. I had a ham and cheese omelet with hash browns and toast with marvelous jam. Mom had the breakfast sandwich which she loved, the bacon!! Cant wait to go again, even if we live in east Mesa!"}
{"text":"I consider myself an expert on breakfast. I know this place is all the rave, but I think it stinks. Let me list the reasons. First, the place is tiny. Second, you can never get in. Third, the food is OK, and their soda sucks; they serve RC! Fourth, the place is always hot in the summer. Fifth, when you finally get a seat it is uncomfortable (They serve fat people food, but yet their seating is set up for a 5'1\" 100 pound girl). Sixth, it is a small neighborhood place so you would think people would be nice, but they are pretty stand offish. If you have ever been to nasty truck stop (versus a good one), this is the same type of food and atmosphere. Unless you are a yuppie and looking to slum it and want to say you experienced it, I suggest skipping this place."}
{"text":"Ate here during our layover. Usually, I prefer pancakes over waffles, but no protein was offered with the pancakes, so I chose the waffle since it comes with some bacon.  HOLY COW!  I actually set my fork down after the first bite. That was the best waffle I have ever had in my life. I usually don't react to food that way, and I wasn't happy with our somewhat rude waitress, so for the food to turn me around on the place that quickly is impressive, to say the least.  The waitress is the only reason I took a star away, and I'm willing to accept that we may have just caught her at a bad time. Unfortunately, we don't travel through that airport normally, so I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to go back and give them another shot."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had gone to Matt's Big Breakfast. I had heard some amazing things about it, outside of the fact that the wait times were horrendous, due to the fact that their original location was SO small. Low and behold, they opened up a second location, more than twice the size of their original one (still pretty small to be honest), so we HAD to try it.   We arrived at 7am on a Saturday morning, thinking we'd have NO issues getting in THAT early. We were wrong. We waited an hour or so... it could have been a longer wait though since our whole party didn't show up til 7:15ish. After the long anticipated wait, we finally ordered! Let me just mention, you really can't substitute or make many changes, if any, to your order. I ordered pancakes and wanted some blueberries, but was told no, lol. Regardless, the pancakes were super delicious! And they came with real maple syrup. Side note... use the syrup sparingly, asking for any extra will cost you an additional $1.50 :P  On another note, I heard their eggs benedict was AMAZING! Sadly, it's only a special and it wasn't on the day I went. I may just have to go again to try it!"}
{"text":"I think everyone in Phoenix comes here for breakfast. Everyone. This place was packed with people eating inside, and with people waiting outside to eat. I probably waited 45-50 minutes to eat here. Was it worth it? Maybe. I had looked at the menu while waiting, so I knew what I wanted to order. I ordered the Chop and Chick, which is eggs made to order, and a pork chop, which I think they must use some sort of pesto rub or marinade. I had also heard about their strawberry lemonade, but they didn't have any that day! The server said they had blackberry lemonade, which also sounded good, so I ordered that to go with my breakfast choice.   The food came out pretty quickly. I had ordered my eggs over medium and my pork chop came with choice of hash browns or rosemary home fries and choice of toast (white, wheat, rye, and something else). I picked rosemary home fries and the wheat toast. The potatoes were delicious!!! Best part of the meal and I devoured every last piece. The rosemary flavoring was amazing. The wheat bread seemed to be made in house - it came in thick slices and was buttered. The server brought over (I think) blueberry preserves which went great with the toast. The pork chop was also really good, but the meat was a little on the dry side. I ate all of it, because I was really hungry after waiting almost an hour to eat. The lemonade was yummy but it was too sweet - would've been perfect if I added a little water to it.   Service was fine - it took a while to flag someone down to get the check and to pay.   Overall, I liked the ambiance - it's a cute and fun place, and obviously everyone likes to come here to eat breakfast/brunch. The piggy decorations are cute and I like the orange accents. What I ordered was okay - the potatoes were amazing. If I were to come back, I'd probably order something else (the Hog and Chick was the other one I was eyeing). They have a location at the Airport in Terminal 4, so perhaps I'll try to eat there and hope that it's not crazy busy."}
{"text":"This place has received a lot of hype, so be prepared to wait. and wait. and wait.  To make the trip more enjoyable: - don't actually come hungry (or risk passing out in the lot from low-blood sugar) - show up at least hour earlier than you want to be seated then get on list - go hang out  at the farmers market across street while you wait - expect solid (but not mind blowing) food  Go for the experience at least once, then find another breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Guy Fieri's recommendations never disappoint.   Came in with the expectation that this place would be good considering it was on the Food Network but my expectations were exceeded! Had the Salami Scramble which was DELICIOUS! The side of hashbrowns were AMAZING (maybe the best part of the meal) and I was pleasantly surprised the side of toast was a legit piece of bread, like something you would find at a bakery, and not just a slice of bread you could buy at the market. Eggs were fresh and light and the salami was perfection.   Only downside was that they made us wait outside for our table which was a little ridiculous considering it was 115 degrees outside. But I got nothing bad to say about their food."}
{"text":"I'm new to Matt's and I agree with the hype.  Great food, great prices, and now they're in the Biltmore area.  Definitely try this spot.  Great Food!"}
{"text":"Matts Big breakfast is a quaint place to enjoy a simple meal.  Great location, easy parking and friendly people."}
{"text":"Good place for a classic breakfast. Service is quick and friendly. The menu is pretty basic but down really well. However there is always a crazy long wait which I don't really get. There is another Matt's big breakfast location and I would much rather go to that one since it tends to be less crazy! I just can't justify waiting an hour for a table at breakfast"}
{"text":"Wish I  of found this place  years ago.   You'd never know it from the store front but if your looking for a great breakfast look no further.    Matt's is great. The staff is accommodating, the food is amazing, and the prices are very reasonable. The quality of the ingredients is evident in every bite. Matt's takes breakfast to a new level.  Matt's Big Breakfast is just that..BIG..  Matt's serves Classic breakfast food with a twist of unique combinations and freshness.  On my first visit I had the salami and eggs, home style potatoes  with sourdough toast and homemade peach preserves. All I can say about the peach preserves (which is made daily at Matt's) is   AMAZINGLY ADDICTING.  Try it Your taste buds will thank you.  So if you love breakfast like I do  give Matt's BIG Breakfast a try."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times I have enjoyed my meals and came away a very happy camper.   On my first visit, I tried the Chop and Chick, which was really good, but being I currently have braces on my teeth, I found the porkchop was a little hard for me to chew, but it didn't deter me from eating it. I also had their infamous Rosemary Home Fries, which are cooked in olive oil and Rosemary and SO DAMN GOOD!   This time, I had the Waffle, which came with bacon and I ordered a side of the Rosemary Home Fries. They are so addicting! The bacon as thick and cooked just the way I like it...and so tasty! MMMMMM MMMMMMM GOOD!!!  Got in and out of there this time within an hour and barely had a wait for a table but then we went earlier this time too. The first time, we waited I'd say between 20-30 minutes for a table but it as well worth it.   I recommend giving Matt's a try. This place is great and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"The place was packed.  The staff was friendly.  The food was huge portions,  it was ok not great.  Nothing special except the jam was really good.  We'd probably stop again if we were in the area ."}
{"text":"Wish I would have found this place years ago.  You never know from the store front but if you're looking for a great breakfast, then look no further, Matt's is the place for you.  The staff at Matt's is accommodating, the food is amazing, and the prices are very reasonable.  The quality of the ingredients  is evident in everybite. Matt's takes breakfast  to a new level.   Matt's big breakfast, is just that, big. Matt's serves classic breakfast food with a  twist of unique combinations.   Today I had salami  and eggs, homestule potatoes, sourdough bread with homemade peach preserves.  All I can say about the peach preserve is it was absolutely delicious and it's made at Matt's daily.  If your looking for a great breakfast at a reasonable price give Matt's a try."}
{"text":"We arrived around 945am on a Tuesday morning.  There was already a line to get seated.  We didn't have to wait long to be seated.  It's a smaller place and very loud.  I had the special, sausage biscuits and gravy, eggs, and home fries.  The biscuit was gigantic and the sausage gravy full of sausage.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, over-medium.  I didn't like the home fries as they had too much rosemary and it overpowered the potatoes.  I did try the bacon.  It was very good.  The best part was the blueberry jam on toast!  Excellent blueberry flavor!"}
{"text":"Very odd location (in the middle of a corporate park), but DELICIOUS food. As my husband said, \"It tastes like a home cooked meal.\" Everything seemed fresh and made from scratch--even the bread and OJ. We each got omelets. I got the hash browns, he got the breakfast potatoes. Both great, but I'm a sucker for hash browns. The service is friendly and there's a fun, casual vibe. We both agreed it was the best meal experience we had in Tempe."}
{"text":"The food was great, the staff was okay, and the specials were confusing. I thought I order the correct thing until I looked at the chalkboard and realized I had to be that annoying patron that wants to change everything about a special because the server didn't inform me of the special."}
{"text":"I ate breakfast here on the 4th of July. Honestly, the food is decent (nothing special)-it's also overpriced.   MBB is a small restaurant that always has a line out the door and around the corner, but since I've eaten here, I really don't understand why.  Maybe everyone's visiting Phoenix like me????  I highly recommend going to LoLo's, it's better (more options and taste wise), and you get more bang for your buck. A stranger (Phoenix resident) also leaned over to tell me that LoLo's is definitely the better option."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast lived up to it's name! We definitely had a BIG yummy breakfast. My husband had the sirloin special*picture posted. Which he absolutely devoured. I enjoyed their basic breakfast with bacon. I wish I would have snapped a pic of the thick bacon. Great food, reasonably priced, and fast friendly service!"}
{"text":"I'd heard so much about Matt's and couldn't wait to try it. I was surprised that the place wasn't full during lunch. I expected to at least have a short wait since I'd heard how popular Matt's is.  We went out for lunch knowing we'd have breakfast. Service was good but I was underwhelmed with the selection. Yeah, I know, it's breakfast. My egg sandwich was just average as well. My colleagues' meals looked good and maybe I just made the wrong choice. I'm not sure I'd try this place again. If we're in the area, maybe.   Tip: for those not working in one of the buildings at this location, there is parking just north of Matt's don't try this before attempting to park in the structure. We happened to luck out."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.  They have a boring, uninspired menu. Nothing special. The food itself was fine.  It was fresh, and they apparently use all-natural organics.  We had the special Denver scramble. The home fries are chunks of pan-fried potato. Lots of rosemary.  But the flavors just weren't very exciting or bold.  The strawberry preserves were very good, as was thick cut toast.  Yes, the toast is worth mentioning.  Cut thick, toasted to perfection.  And the bread itself is a really good bread.  I doubt I will return.  If I'm going to go out for breakfast I would choose someplace that features bolder flavors, like The Farmhouse in Gilbert.  My wife liked it better than I did.  It's really not bad, but if I'm going to go out and pay for a meal I prefer something less pedestrian."}
{"text":"Hand down, the best breakfast place in town. I love the weekly special and the waffle here. Came here every other weeks for the last 3 year!"}
{"text":"And Babe Ruth lines up to the plate and points to rafters in the outfield...and the pitch- it's hit deep-it could be- IT'S GONE! HOME RUN!   My party and I arrived during the bustling Sunday brunch rush around noon and waited about 30 minutes for our table. When we arrived at our table we were greeted by a very attentive and soothing server and surrounded by a cozy yet comforting ambiance. Our server was fantastic in her suggestions on food choices and when my friend declined the toast that came with the meal, she suggested that we get it anyway as the bread is speculator. Our server was correct. The toast was thick, fluffy, and delicious with just the right amount of butter and a side of fresh in house strawberry preserve. The breakfast menu is limited to around 8 or 9 items but every dish we ordered was damn near perfection. I ordered the rib-eye and eggs and could not be more satisfied. The steak was juicy and seasoned with just enough to give a great flavor without being bland or overbearing. I will be coming back to frequent this wonderful restaurant for many a brunches to come. Well done Matt's Big Breakfast, well done!"}
{"text":"Food looked good & smelled good. Place was packed with people enjoying their food. Tuesday's special is biscuits, gravy, eggs, potatoes & bacon. Unfortunately I don't eat eggs or gravy. They don't sell their biscuits any other way, so I had a choice of paying for the gravy & eggs too or not getting any biscuits at all. I go to restaurants so I can eat exactly what I want...so I didn't get biscuits, or anything else except the coffee I had unfortunately already ordered & the fee I paid to park at the meter because their lot was full. I'm bummed."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great! The wait wasn't that long at all, coming from NY I have seen alot worse. The actual restaurant itself is very small, obvious reason for the wait.  I ordered the Special of the Day - Huevos Rancheros along with an order of Griddle Cakes, both were quite delicious. Overall, the only negative was the wait which again wasn't as bad I was expecting.   I definitely will come back to this place, guaranteed a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service, the waitress was very friendly and helpful. Delicious food!!!! All of the ingredients used are natural and of quality. They buy from local suppliers when possible. I had the Griddle Cakes, to die for! Especially when they have me handmade strawberry jam. I definitely suggest these if you love pancakes. I wish their floors would have been cleaner, but I can only imagine how hard it is to maintain them when they are extremely busy. Definitely check it out! My friends from out of town truly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast truly lives up to the hype. Friendly staff even when the place is Uber busy. The host is amazing, food was great and don't expect jam from a little plastic tub their stuff is awesome. We will be back."}
{"text":"This Matt's 'Big' Breakfast location is actually very small, and loud.  But the service is very good, a bit chaotic but friendly.  The average breakfast of eggs, bacon, sausage is nothing special (but bacon and toast are thicker).  If that's all you're interested in, you might get a better deal at a Denny's or IHOP that's less crowded.  However, if you go for their more interesting dishes, that's where Matt's shines. People really like the french toast and pan cakes with REAL maple syrup, large hash-brown portions, beautiful omelettes, homemade preserves and more.  Matt's was also featured on 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives'"}
{"text":"The food at Matt's is great, and you'll expect it to be based on the wait and the reviews. The portions might not be quite as big as the name, or especially the price, might suggest."}
{"text":"This place is great!!!!!! Great food,  fast service and fresh food.   If I'm ever in the Phoenix airport again I'll be back"}
{"text":"THE LINE IS HELLA LONG!!! so is the wait!! other than that I thought it was good..... Oh yah phoenix is hot.... and you will be standing in line outside!"}
{"text":"Overpriced is my first thought. Overall our food was good and service was friendly and all but I wasn't going \"wow\" because of the price. I don't mind paying for large portions or something super good but $7.50 for a couple pancakes is too much for my retired wallet."}
{"text":"Great Food ! Attempted Matts in downtown Phoenix this past Monday, lines up and down, had company, couldn't wait. Today we were determined to get to Matts so we found location  nearer our home on Camelback, 1:30 arrival, safe, not as busy.  Service very sweet, friendly, everyone was soooo nice. Simple menu, simple operation, and everything we ordered was hot, fresh, so good, we ate too much, worth it though. Waffle, delicious, bacon perfect, coffee excellent, it was flawless, and the service was genuine, such a pleasure to discover a non chain feel (so done with chainy experience) I cannot wait to return to Matts again. Manager was very attentive and very hospitable, Great Job, see you soon."}
{"text":"I almost didn't stay to even find out how the food was because of the rude bald guy. I don't know if he's the host or an owner or a manager...I didn't see any kind of name tag or anything. We walked in, stood there for a bit, then bald guy greeted us. We asked for a table for 2. He replied \"Ok...it'll be a bit of a wait.\" We asked about how long. He replied \"I really have no way to tell\". Seriously?? I mean, restaurants of all types and sizes have been giving approximate wait times since the beginning of time. You can't give me a ballpark? 5 minutes? 5 hours?? Something??? I was parked at a meter and had already paid for an hour so I decided to wait at least a little longer since parking was paid for. Had I been in a free parking place, we would have left for sure. We sat on a bench out front behind an old guy with a big fake boob lady whose backs were facing us...he kept putting his thumb inside her panties and molesting her butthole. They continued inside the restaurant as well. I'm sure this entertainment helped us pass the time, but unfortunately they probably aren't there all the time so your wait might be more boring.  Thankfully bald guy wasn't our server. We got Britney (dunno if it's spelled right, sorry!). Britney was fantastic. She was friendly (which is something I wasn't expecting because of reading other reviews while waiting for the...maybe 15-20 minutes it took for us to get a table.) She made great recommendations and was very prompt and pleasant. She is the only reason I give 3 stars instead of 1 or 2.  The food was...decent. The bacon was kind of thick and floppy for my taste. I like crispy bacon, but to each his own. The special was decent, the waffle was edible but not great by any means. The hash browns were delicious and tasted like buttery mashed potatoes inside. It was stuff I'd eat again but wouldn't see myself craving and traveling across town for."}
{"text":"Open early for breakfast. Ordered steak and eggs. Medium well came out bloody and blood on eggs. Server noticed it when he got to table and asked if it was ok? Was not. He took back and made a comment \"our cook is really bad\". After overcooking steak brought back to me with cold eggs still covered in blood. Not my best experience."}
{"text":"YUMMY breakfast spot! Matt and his wife are super nice and the food is excellent. Tried the porkchop breakfast and it was soo good. Even Guy Fierri from foodnetwork thinks its the best breakfast he's ever had!   The restaurant is really tiny but didn't wanna take away a star for that cuz its definitely worth the wait. The homefries are reallly good too and you get that on the side with almost every dish anyway. =)"}
{"text":"We love this spot for breakfast. The food is delicious and the service is even better. Also Vince is adorable"}
{"text":"I would have given this a better review, but the hostess knew my friend and apparently had a personal issue with her and chose to skip us several times on the waitlist intentionally. I brought this up with a manager finally when people who were just walking in were being sat after we had been waiting for 20 minutes. Given it was a Sunday morning, we knew we would be waiting, but not after people who were under us on the waitlist and who we witnessed walk in and put their name down after us.  Once we were finally sat, I am not sure if our server was super busy or forgot about us, but a manager ended up taking care of us the entire time. The chocolate milk claimed to be organic, but when I got it, it was poorly mixed with syrup which I do not like at all. They use ghiradelli apparently to mix it, but still, mention on the menu that it is not organic or that it is made with ghiradelli chocolate syrup.  I got the waffle with berry compote and it was very yummy and I had a side of bacon which was amazing as well. Had it not been for the start to our meal, I probably would be rating this restaurant at least 4 stars, but the experience starts the minute you walk in the door. Being rushed to sit in a section where the server was not ready was not exactly what we were hoping for either. I would love to say I'll give this place another try, but I probably won't. The parking situation is sort of annoying since you have to park in the garage and have a two hour limit before it's not free (no validation needed) and the walk is not really enjoyable either."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and have always loved what we've ordered. Bacon is THICK. Coffee is GREAT! And most (if not all of their ingredients are local. Bread comes from Wildflower Bakery, coffee is from a local distributor in North Phoenix, meats come from local supplier in Queen Creek and owner's wife makes the preserve spread herself from local fruit  in season.   #1 Best LOCAL Classic American Breakfast"}
{"text":"Great breakfast at Matt's Big Breakfast.  Arrived at 9:20 on a Friday, perfect timing to avoid the morning rush.  It was busy but we were seated right away.  Went for the Friday scramble.  Home fries were very flavorful with carmelized onion.  Eggs and sausage also very good."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix visiting relatives and met for brunch.  I had the 'fav 5' or something like that... it's a breakfast sandwich.  Best $5 breakfast sandwich I ever had.  Everyone else seemed to like the food and all of us said we would eat here again.    Food: Good food.  Worth the wait!    Service: Good service.     The complaints: We were seated in the stock room.  We were constantly interrupted when they needed to get into the fridge and the room itself was very warm.  The main part of the restaurant seemed cooler, but louder.  Even so we would still recommend this place."}
{"text":"It was good. Reasonable price for extremely large portions. Constantly very busy. Friendly staff. Kind of feels like they're trying to rush you in and out. Tasty food, but nothing I'd insist someone to experience."}
{"text":"As soon as we got word that class was canceled for the day we hit road with one destination in mind: Matt's Big Breakfast. This was my first experience with Matt's; my classmate is a little more cultured that I am, so he knew the ropes from previous experiences.   There really isn't a lot that the general public can use for parking near the restaurant, but I used my university parking pass to park in the ASU lot right across the street. Even though we went on a Tuesday morning the place was still packed. But the 20 minute wait wasn't bad because the weather was as nice as the outdoors waiting area.   Once we were seated (in pretty close quarters I might add) our waitress took our drink orders almost immediately. I got the honey lemonade which was such a great (and different) combination.   My classmate and I ordered the same breakfast entree: the five spot sandwich with a side of homestyle potatoes. Sweet Mary, the bacon on the sandwich was literally perfect. Everything tasted fantastic and complimented each other so well.   I will eat here again whether or not my class has been canceled!"}
{"text":"You better have a LOT of time on your hands. Waited 29 minutes for my breakfast sandwich, and the finally asked for my money back. That took an additional 10 minutes, during which time the sandwich still never came out. Finally got my money in time to barely jump on my plane. The best part is on top of everything I was ace to feel as if everything was my fault somehow. Not one \"sorry for the inconvenience\" or anything of the sort. Every single person I encountered including two managers (?) were completely rude.   Great way to spend my 45 minutes in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The place to have breakfast when you are in Tempe! The food is great as is the service. Not wild about the office building location but don't let that stop you."}
{"text":"This great breakfast spot is now open on Mondays too!  YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are ever in the downtown Phoenix area I highly suggest you drop in on this retro/modern diner that was featured on Guy Fieris Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.I have been in phx area for 10 yrs and finally decided to try this critically acclaimed diner. Aside from being slightly difficult to find (my inability to give directions, lol), Matts is an excellent healthy alternative to your run of the mill breakfast places. I went on the thursday morning prior to Superbowl 49 expecting lines to be around the corner even though it was close to 10 am. Although busy, our party of 3 didnt have to wait at all.  While ordering and eating it became busy enough that people began to have to wait.  I chose to order the cheese omelet with mushrooms, onions and sausage. I also had  their hash browns, wheat toast and coffee.  where do I begin? The coffee is so good that it needs little if any sugar in the raw (rather than processed) or milk (organic).  The toast is thick and grainy (aka awesome) and best of all not processed. To accompany the great toast was a sweet yet all naturally made on site raspberry preserve. I was informed that this was a rare occasion that they were sering the raspberry as they normally serve strawberry or bluberry also both all natural and delicious (im guessing).  The first few bites of both the omelet and hash browns threw me for a loop until I figured out that I was tasting or rather wasnt tasting artificial cooking oils or grease (which unfortunately Im used to). I was actually TASTING the food. I typically do not care for hassh browns because they tend to either be too dry or not dry enough but these were perfectly done with just enough crisp and moistness....no need to add anything other than a bit of hot sauce.  The omelet was thin and large enough to hold all the cheddar cheese, onions, and mushrooms. Unfortunately either the waitress didnt hear me order the sausage or the cook forgot to add them to the omelet. Had the sausage been in the omelet I think they would have needed a third egg to hold all the additions. The atmosphere on this particular day was one of turn and burn (aka busy) and locals, and out of towners."}
{"text":"Waited a half hour on a Sunday afternoon to try this Phoenix hotspot. Mostly a young crowd (this location was close by an ASU campus), I would guess they are drawn by good eats at good prices. I ordered the Sunday special, a nicely trimmed center cut sirloin steak, two eggs, home fries and sourdough toast with homemade strawberry preserves. The steak was cooked to order perfectly (medium rare), the home fries, eggs and toast were equally good. My wife ordered the Niman ranch hamburger with thick sliced bacon. Unfortunately, it came to the table well after my meal came and then had to be returned because it was underdone. By the time a properly cooked replacement arrived, I had already eaten my meal(at my wife's insistence!).  On the plus side, the burger was delicious and she yummied it up. No less than three of the staff members apologized for the mishap and the manager let us know he was taking the burger off the bill, even though we never griped about the delay.   I am from out of town, but I'm loving Phoenix hospitality! I would definitely return to Matt's; hoping I get the opportunity during my short stay here."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Be prepared for a wait list. Also limited parking, so you may need some coin for a parking meter down the street. Very small interior, don't bring a group. Gotta try Matt's Big Breakfast at least once."}
{"text":"Overall the food was pretty good but no kids menu. Thumbs down on that one. Had to order from full menu for my 4 yr old and she hardly ate it.  I went here a few weeks ago.   My negative review has to do with families with small kids me being one of them I went to change my 6 month old and went into the restroom where I saw there was no changing table.  This was a newer restaurant and I was appalled that I had to change her on the floor. The handicap stall was large enough where a table could've placed on the wall. After changing her I looked for the manager.  He said it was not his doing and if I would have said something before changing my daughter he would have had me go behind the barn door where they store chairs etc and i could change her there.  That's horrible too.  He apologized to me again on the way out and proceeds to tell me they are getting one installed soon but yet he didn't tell me that earlier. I would be curious if someone can tell me one was actually installed.  Other females in the bathroom also said this was bad as they saw me in the floor with my child.  Luckily I had all my stuff with me so she wasn't entirely on the floor."}
{"text":"Two airport employees recommended this place. It's the only sit down in the American Airlines terminal, and I was just trying to get my contractions to stop after my mad sprint to my flight after the connecting one was late. I got a meal voucher out of it *le sigh*  I really like that there's outlets pretty much everywhere you sit. That is awesome. Service was fast. I got a honey lemonade... which tasted like.. uhhh.. honey lemonade. It was off, but that's totally my fault.  I got the Sweet and Savory, which was French toast and apple sausage. The entree was no bueno. I am not reviewing to James Beard winner status, but it's a few rungs below IHOP and Denny's. I didn't finish my food, and I'm totally pregnant and exhausted. Something in the execution or the recipe went horribly awry.   Food and drink: $16 something."}
{"text":"Perfect local restaurant for breakfast. Be prepared to wait. We came in on a Friday morning and it was packed. I had the hog and chick... Fantastic. Thick cut peppered bacon that's delicious. If ur a fan of bacon give this place a try. Love the ambience. Fits in the downtown area real nice."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to this place because we visited another location which was great. But the service was very poor, we asked the waitress to move us from the bar because the chairs were very uncomfortable and she 'pretended' to go ask the hostess and never got back to us. The food was not the greatest either. There was a hair on my toast, the bacon was over cooked, the eggs really runny and the hash brown very hard to break through and eat. Will definitely not come back to this location."}
{"text":"Holy pancake orgasm, Batman!    The richest. smoothest. buttery-est, fullest, fluffiest, tastiest cooked-to-perfection pancakes you'll ever eat. Those of us who haven't had the pleasure of dining at Matt's thought we knew a good pancake... WRONG!  Matt's is where it's at, 1/2 hr-1 hr wait and all (We were seated in 1/2hr Tuesday @ 10am).    The restaurant is very busy, so one cannot expect the servers to build rapport with the customer.  Rather it's more important they keep my coffee and OJ full with a smile, which they did well.  I had the ribeye, eggs and home fries, which was one of the specials of the day.  While my steak was cooked medium when I requested medium-rare, it was delicious, well cooked and seasoned to perfection.   Eggs over easy done text-book as well, fresh, hot and you can't get any better.  The portions on most of the orders seemed small, so we had to order some sides which drove up the bill total.  The menu can be inexpensive if you just order one thing, but there are so many great things to try!.. like the fresh strawberry preserves!  Hands down this is best breakfast gem in Arizona and I can't wait until we can go back!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few time, really hard getting in, expect a line because its that good.  I have had their  Chop-N-Chick; eggs and pesto pork chop, let me tell you, that is one dish you need to try. I tried it because it was on Triple D, Guy would never send us down the wrong path. It is a bit pricey, but the food is worth it.   Homemade jam. I understand that everything is all fresh, they don't even have a freezer, shipped fresh and organic every morning. 4 stars instead of 5 is for the gluten free options. When we are in the area in the morning, we will be back for our breakfast fix."}
{"text":"The waffle was so light! Homemade sausage exploding with flavor and home fries that make you lick your plate!!  I'm so mad that I didn't find this place when I was in Phoenix before!  This restaurant has made my top 5 restaurants in the country!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  There is a huge hype about this place. It was featured on tv. I get there early to eat here with my brother in law and there was a half hour wait. While we were waiting, a huge line started forming to the outside of the restaurant around 8:30am on a Friday.   My brother in law had the special of the day, which was a chipotle jalepeno sausage and cheddar scramble served with potatoes and a tortilla instead of toast. I ordered the Salami scramble. I liked his dish because the chipotle sausage was spicy and full of flavor! My Salami scramble was good, but on the salty side. The salami was cut similar to fries, in long rectangular thick pieces. For some reason, I expected thin slices, but it was good all the same. The \"home fries\" looked more like a hashbrown cassarole and were much, much better than the regular breakfast potatoes. The home fries were my favorite part about being there, more than the salami scramble itself.   The side of sourdough toast that came with my meal was impressive. The toast appeared to be nearly 2 inches thick, and that was a single slice! It was served with a savory homemade marmalade.   The owner and the servers there were very friendly, and despite the chaos of the line of people waiting and people constantly checking to see if a spot opened up yet, the staff handled it very well! That alone I give them 4 stars.   For being a big breakfast, I'd say that my dish was just the \"right portion size for me.\" For some place with big breakfast in the title, if the portion is just right for me, that means that the dish is on the smaller side.   After telling about my experience to another friend, who adores this restaurant, I guess I was supposed to order the pancakes, because they are ridiculously good. I've yet to experience those pancakes. If I'm in the area, I will definitely stop by this place again and give it another try, but I'm not sure if it's worth the 40 minute drive from where I live to wait another hour to get a table once I get there, so that's why I took away half a star, but I still really like the place."}
{"text":"We ended up here after our late evening layover flight dropped us off.  We had an hour and a half to kill, so we wandered about the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport unsure what eatery or drinkery to patronize.  Many places were somewhat busy, but Matt's Big Breakfast was spacious enough to draw our attention.  Even though Matt's advertises breakfast, they have a full bar also!  This was our first official day of vacation and decided to celebrate with a cocktail. We found room at the bar and ordered drinks.  I got a Patron Tequila Sunrise, while Joe K ordered a Captain Morgan rum & coke.  They actually offer you choices of premium brand liquors.  Our beverages came in ample sized glasses and they really hit the spot, quenched our thirsts and gave us a mellowing buzz.  Joe was not feeling well and was having a hard time relaxing, so the cocktails were a welcome availability.  Even though our drinks cost $14.00 each, it was a nice splurge that we don't often indulge in.   As for the food, I can't form an opinion on, but other patrons received some delicious looking meals.  And yes, those breakfasts were quite big!  If we were hungry and had more time, I would have definitely tried out their breakfast!"}
{"text":"Rated one of the best breakfast spots in AZ!  I can see why.  The downtown location is the original location and the one you want to go to.  They have a small menu which is good because they are great at what they make so you do not need a big menu.  All there food is made from scratch which is exactly what you want.  Homemade food.  The one item i suggest to get is the waffle which comes with butter, real syrup and 2 strips of bacon.  It is simple and will knock your socks off!    BrandonFitFoodie"}
{"text":"Ate at the Matt's in the airport, excellent food! Will go to the downtown location when I get back to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I had to try it and All I can say is Really? 45 minute wait, limited menu (not too healthy either).  The hashbrowns were burned on the outside and undercooked on the inside, eggs were a little runny for my taste, toast was cold and the bacon was burned.  Would not recommend"}
{"text":"Was my first time here but didn't know it was on DDD. (Diners, Drive Ins, & Dives). The orange Juice is  and the bacon is peppered. The OJ  is the best I've ever had. I hate has browns but this is the only place I will eat them at. When I go to IHOP or Denny's they just sit on my plate. The construction  might deter you from coming in. But please don't pass this place up. They have breakfast specials as well. I sat at the bar because all the tables were full. The service was really fast. I could have sworn that the food was already prepared, but that wasn't the case. This place has my vote. I wish there was one in North Phoenix."}
{"text":"Contrary to the reviwers below...I love Matt's. Yeah the wait is long...the place is small...once I went in the summer and I was sweating in my coffee...  BUT....  This is Phoenix people. When the breakfast choices are a tasty meal at Circle K (heated under heat lamps) or Denny's and IHOP, you can't beat Matt's.   I love breakfast. I eat breakfast everywhere I travel on business. I have never had a better breakfast than at Matt's. Fresh ingredients, great food, excellent bread and jam...kick $ss hashbrowns.  I wish the place was bigger (and cooler) and the wait not so long. But as a special breakfast treat...you can't beat it.  Just bring your own fan."}
{"text":"Yea, it's okay. A little stuffy in there--lots of tables placed closely together and very loud because of it. I had the 5-Spot. Meh, it was okay. Nothing too exciting. The service took a long time. I was running late so I had my co-workers, whom I was meeting up with, order for me. I arrived 10 minutes after the order had been placed and we still waited another 15 minutes for our food. Very basic. Nothing exciting. I'd go again but only if invited by someone else."}
{"text":"So my hubby and I found ourselves in this area and the first place on my yelp search is this one... and we may had not paid much attention to it, but it sounded like a place a friend had just mentioned a few days back so we decided to try it... You know those little things that set a place apart from the others? this one is full of those! the tap water tastes good, the glasses are quaint and beautiful. The home potatoes had tasty herbs, I ordered eggs and pork chop and the pork chop seemed to have something like pesto. The Wheat bread was better than I ever had, and instead of jelly, real blueberries... I could go on and on. Yes, the place is tiny, and perhaps a little pricey, but I think it is worth it. Service was great too. And since we were there at the right time, we didn't have to wait to be seated, neither had trouble parking. Good luck and enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. Waited about 20 mins outside to get a seat. Ordered their chick and chop it was good! Shared a waffle with a friend and it was delicious! Real maple syrup was to die for! I was gonna order french toast with maple sausage but it's only part of their specials depending on the day. Hence the 4 stars. Overall, food that I ordered did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"A solid 4.5 stars for this downtown Phoenix breakfast joint!!  I went with the 'daily special' (which was erased and replaced by a different breakfast dish before I was done eating, sooooo . . . maybe it's more of an hourly special?).  Eggs Benedict with hash browns.  I also added nourbon cherry sausage and a side of toast.    Everything was phenomenal.  I've got absolutely nothing to complain about regarding this place.    I'll finish with the strongest compliment I can pay a restaurant which is this:  I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast we ever had. The hash brown has so much flavor that its so worth it to drive downtown just for this. dAt potato, i would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Stopped at Matt's Big Breakfast in Tempe Friday morning at 8:30 May 19th. Was confused with the set up, no hostess around.  Finally a guy came from the back. We asked to sit outside which we did. Waited a few minutes and asked the same hostess if we would get service outside. He rudely answered and said you just got here, what do you expect, there will be someone out here! We just didn't know if it was a full service or of we had to order at the counter. It was quite embarrassing with his tone of voice! Rude people like him should never work as a hostess!"}
{"text":"I ordered the omelet with 3 cheeses and home style fries. I asked if they could add grilled onions and raw onions and they did!!It was so good. Everything taste so fresh! The people were so friendly and I had the best server, Darnell."}
{"text":"visiting the area and got this recommendation from yelp. One of the best breakfasts I have had.  The food came out hot and fresh cooked. I had a basic breakfast eggs, potatoes and sausage, good good good.  not much to look at from the exterior but this was a great breakfast.  only reason no five star, canned soft drinks."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast is quite an institution in Phoenix, absolutely the place to go for breakfast. It's great to see the same quality, efficiency and competent wait staff replicated at the airport here. The three point breakfast made for a great lunch, waitress Toni was attentive and helpful, service was quick and the food very solid, not fancy, but tasty and nourishing. Fresh avocados rounded out a two eggs with meat sandwich and rosemary tomatoes. Airport food in general has come such a long way, but Matt's stands out."}
{"text":"Nothing worse then a cook that can't make eggs over-medium. Potatoes were good but the Thick cut bacon is seasoned with way to much pepper.  Nice friendly staff. Will have to try something different."}
{"text":"Another downtown joint I hadn't bothered reviewing because it's such a part of my regular routine.  I love hash browns and Matt's is a hash brown lover's paradise. I don't know exactly how they cook their eggs; I just hope that whatever they do, they keep doing it. It's tasty.   I have friends from Tucson who crash at my place on an occasional weekend, and every Sunday morning before they head back to the Old Pueblo, they insist on my taking them here. They're as addicted as I am.   Long lines on Sunday mornings so expect a wait and bring good conversation topics with you.  NOTE: MrK took some great shots of the place that you can see above. His last interior shot does indeed have Matt in the background, and the very cute Gretel toward the right (she also waitresses at the Roosevelt)."}
{"text":"Recommend. I ordered the classic breakfast with bacon. Best hash brown ever had. Really nice coffee. However, my gf does not like the oats she ordered."}
{"text":"This place does have really good breakfast, the homemade jelly and hash browns are pretty good. But the 12oz OJ for $4.50 is ridiculous!!! I know it's fresh squeezed but really?"}
{"text":"Breakfast is consistently good! I usually get the ham and cheese omelette with potatoes. My favorite part is the buttery sourdough bread with homemade strawberry jam. It's the main reason why I come to this place. It's amazing!  There's usually a wait time but we've never had to wait more than 15 minutes. The food is always out surprisingly fast and most of the servers are really nice."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for many years but I was only compelled to write a review today. There are a few things I want to address.   First, the menu is extremely limited. I don't feel that the quality and presentation are up to par for such a limited menu. If you serve few things, those few things should be executed with perfection.   Next, there is most always a wait here. I have seen the crowds and lines on the weekends. I never visit on the weekends because I don't believe that it is worth the wait. You can usually score a table with 5 mins or less wait during the week days, but you do need to arrive early.   Now let's talk service. I consistently get trash service here. It's just one square room where the servers can see you all the time but seem to just avoid your eyes when you try to catch their attention. My drinks have always sat empty, even the water! They are always rushed and don't make friendly conversation. The one compliment I do have is that the food is always FAST here. The kitchen has their act together.   Last, it is loud in there. The metal chairs scrape on the concrete floors, and those sounds combine with three dozen or so different conversations and kid noises. It is labor intensive to have a conversation! I don't want to have to scream at breakfast like it's a nightclub.  This is allegedly a Phoenix great, but not for me. The food is okay, the service is bad, and the atmosphere is better than when it was in the little house, but still not good."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Five Spot\" breakfast sandwich and orange juice.  The sandwich was good, nothing spectacular but good quality food.  Fresh squeezed orange juice was good.  Nothing memorable but I would come back for the good quality ingredients, if in the area.  The place is very loud with everyone doing their own thing.  There is a little bit of a line on Saturday mornings but the wait didn't seem to be too long for most people, maybe 15 minutes."}
{"text":"***300th Review***  This place is so nice, we went there twice!!!  I was on my own for breakfast one morning and had read awesome things about this place. I am so glad I went!  Service was friendly and lightning fast!  I went with the recommendation of the server, and got the special: 3 Eggs Scrambled with Wisconsin Cheddar, Chipotle Sausage, and fresh jalapenos.  So simple and so fricken good! OMFG!  The fresh jalapenos were so spicy and yummy!  It also came with hash browns.  I know this is a simple thing, but, seriously, I've never had better hash browns in my life. I also had to order a side of bacon and am so glad I did. YUM!  Good coffee to go with all this too.     Later in the day, the hubby got out of his meeting early so we went to grab lunch there!!!  He loved the Reuben: its flavor, quality and quantity of meat, etc.  Had more hash browns and bacon =)  and tried the waffle. Tasty!  I would go here every week if I lived here. Matt's really has a commitment to local, fresh ingredients and it shows in the food and how buy this place can get!  Am so glad I didn't have to wait for a table though..."}
{"text":"Great, great spot to wait for your plane if you're in Terminal 4. When I went to Phoenix ages ago (and ate carbs with no abandon), this was my favorite place in Phoenix!  Now that I don't enjoy the pancakes or the hash browns, I am still glad to post up at Matt's, enjoy some of their delicious peppered bacon, grab a drink (or a few), have great service, and listen to good music while sitting in an airport.  Thanks Matt's!"}
{"text":"I would highly avoid the Matt's Big Breakfast Takeaway location in the airport. They state it will take only 15 minutes to receive your order. However, it took almost 40 with no customer service apologizing for the wait. I would pick up breakfast else where because their time estimate is unrealistic. I had an hour until my flight boarded and left the food at the restaurant because it still was not ready by the time I needed it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and has since branched out to a few other locations so you don't have to battle the parking and crowds of downtown! Their scramble of the day is usually really good, but don't skip the sourdough toast and jam! My only hesitation for not giving 5 stars is the menu is on the short side and drinks are really limited."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends a few weeks ago. We were ready for a good brunch before heading up to the Grand Canyon. I had heard about this place for awhile and been wanting to try it. We got here around noon on a Friday and there was still a 20 minute wait.  It's a pretty small, bustling place. We were seated near the back and had to pull up a chair at the end for the 5th person. Our server was nice and friendly, brought our drinks and took our orders promptly. I had a scramble with salami and cheese, and I subbed the potatoes for grilled tomato. My other friends got the egg white scramble, the special of the day, which I think was an omelet with pork and cheese.   Everything came out pretty fast which was nice since we were starving. For all the good that I had heard of this place though, I was mildly disappointed. I will say the food tasted good and clean, not greasy or overly salty and buttery. So that was definitely refreshing, but in terms of amazing flavor, it just wasn't there. Got a decent portion for the price though. Honestly, I'd say it's more 3.5 stars than 3, but I don't exactly understand or agree with the hype."}
{"text":"Best American breakfast joint in AZ! I've come here many times and will be coming back.  I love there applewood thick cut bacon it has a lot of flavor. The hash brown is to die for its crunchy and crispy. The strawberry preserve is fresh and complements the toast real well. The orange juice is freshly squeezed and sweet.  Be prepared to wait at least 25-30 mins but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love  Matts Big Breakfast  but this location isn't the same as the one I go in downtown Phoenix. They don't have any hash browns which is a must have every time I go to Matts. The toast here was not even warm my butter didn't even melt (wtf)? It looked like they were pre toasting the bread to save time. I asked the waitress and she said it's what they do since it gets so \"busy\". I've seen the original location twice as \"busy\" as this place but they don't half assed on their quality.  Save yourself the disappointment and go to the downtown location."}
{"text":"At least 4-stars, if not 5, for a breakfast place in the airport.   Great peppered bacon, crisp as requested.   Very attentive staff.  Solid omelette, decent cheese.  Even the breakfast potatoes have rosemary and are thoroughly cooked and nicely done.   Love that they have cocktails, but didn't try any."}
{"text":"Fail, Fail, Fail, Fail..... so after trying to get to this place for months, after reading all these amazing reviews I can not begin to explain the disappointment of our long anticipate wait for this supposedly fantastic spot for breakfast.  Where to start. ... Cold-reheated potatoes,  not just one of our plates but 2 of our meals came out like this ( we arrived right at 6:43am) expecting freshly made food first thing in the morning...followed by \"Center Cut Sirloin \" a.k.a. Hamburger Patty priced at $15.99 Daily Special.  Seriously guys, Dennys serves a better Sirloin Steak breakfast. Then seeing Costco \"Kettle Chips\" bags stacked in the open view kitchen and showing them on the menu as if they are something that was prepared there fresh. Lastly,  one of the male workers complaining about his work schedule to another in a very unprofessional manner,  in short form, I would not recommend spending  $58.00 for breakfast for 3 Adults and 1 child.... First and LAST visit my family will be making to this place."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place on Arizona Highways.  I had no idea what to expect, but since it is a very rare occasion for me to be up at 7am and I happen to be in the area,  Matt's big breakfast was my destination.  The venue is pretty small with an equally small menu.  I was expecting more options.  We ordered waffles with bacon and The Five Spot (breakfast sandwich).  Both were very good.  Coffee was from cave creek and was pretty good as well.  Service was great.  Our server was upbeat and friendly.  She told me how much she loved working there and I can see she was sincere.    I do plan on coming back here.  I grade them a solid A."}
{"text":"There and back again..  We ventured this morning to a great land called Phoenix (though today we shall call that Gondor) from our little Scottsdale burrow (we shall call that the Shire). The Shire has many wonderful things to offer so we don't venture to far.   There's been talk of a movement in the great land of Gondor.. this movement is called Slow Food. Were great humans feed others based on sustainable crops, dairy and meat. These humans try to whenever possible, use only locally grown ingredients. There was word of an outdoor market that believes in these philosophies and shares with all the locals there. So off to Gondor.    After an easy and painless journey we arrived at the great outdoor market to find that it wasn't open yet. A very small distance east of there were a few humans mulling around a classic Gondor building that looked to have been turned into some sort of eatery. Once inside we discovered a great man named Matt and his magical Big Breakfast! We were seated at a counter with many other hungry travelers.   A fair maiden appeared.. she was so friendly and welcoming.. then took our orders.. the great man Matt had created something just for that day.. Salsa Verde Huevos Rancheros. The way the maiden pronounced these words we though for a moment she was speaking Elven.. only moments had passed and then set before us were 2 huge plates filled with roasted potatoes, 2 eggs over easy atop a corn tortilla covered in a green sauce. You see hobbits love good food, you can tell by their round bellies and lack of defined abs.. this was indeed a bountiful feast!  The fragrance arose from the plate and filled our nostrils.. we both stared into each others eyes then quickly began eating.. the flavors and textures were simply heavenly.. each better then the last!   We could see ourselves making the journey to Gondor quite often from the Shire.. we could see someday perhaps living in Gondor close to the outdoor market and of course the great Matt's Big Breakfast."}
{"text":"I dont know how the breakfast is, but the \"Mamacita Burger\" (could be Diablo) was fantastic. Perfect medium rare, jalipeno's kick'in it. Great flavor and perfect with a Kilt Lifter Scottish ale to help smolder the beast of burger!   Nice job Chef!"}
{"text":"Get here early busy,busy even on Easter Sunday. Can't beat Matts big breakfast!   Three egg scramble with smoked pork tenderloin. Yummm"}
{"text":"2nd time eating here for breakfast. Really like this place. Service is great & solid, fresh food that's made to order. Perfect for when you have to spend a morning at the airport."}
{"text":"Fun and unique  Mom and pop restaurant. A very small dining area with a menu that helps you decide by only being a page long. The food is very good with the pancakes and hash browns being note worthy. Expect a wait due to its popularity."}
{"text":"I would definately eat here.  I have been to three different locations and have not had a bad experiance at one.  I highly recommend this as a place to eat."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for a while so I thought I save up a big appetite before I went. There was a wait to get seated which I didn't mind. It was the weekend after all. About 25 minutes later I was seated by the windows. I got an omelette and toast plus coffee. It was good. I think the toast was actually the best part."}
{"text":"We have been here plenty of times and keep coming back because of the food, one time our waitress dug her tiny shorts out of her ass and proceeded to serve us without washing her hands first. We made a comment to the owner she apologized but then we saw the cook cough all over our food. We went there today with our daughter, only a party of 2 was on the list ahead of us. Well once they were sat the hostess sat people that came in after us. When we questioned her about it she said that they only seat party of 3 at their ridiculously tiny tables. Which wouldn't be so bad if they didn't bring every item you order on its own plate. We weren't given an option of the bar or table. Which we would've picked the bar because there is more room and it was available first. They attempted to sit us at the baby table and sat a party of 3 white people at the bar. She was very friendly to the white costumers but not us. My money is green just like theirs. Will not be going back for a long time...please make the little girls that work there wear shorts that are longer than their vagina. Very unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Buttery Buttery Buttery...YUMMY!  After dealing with the WRONG way on 7th (thanks for nothing Yahoo! maps), we were now super duper hungry...and secretly, I need breakfast within 30 minutes of waking up. I knew there could be a weekend wait and with some toast in my belly I braved the hot noon sun. Located next to a sketchy hotel/residence space (hash browns AND heroin!), this small space is DAMN small. A nice walkway with cacti and rustic fence create a lil space, and dumps you into the counterspace/dining room. First impression-this place is WHITE-I mean, like the walls are white, the counter is, the seats are re-upholstered vintage chrome stools white, but the tables are a beautful blood orange formica-oh yeah, I like that...with lil' orange gerber daisies. Like so, cute.  We thought about sitting at the counter, but with a chance for shortie chairs, we went next to the window that actually gave a promising look of artsy downtown PHX-def. added to the experience instead of what I would consider a dreaded smooshed in one in the small room in the back (is that where bad people go to eat eggs?). After some confusion over why one would need water AND iced tea, I got to sample their coffee and orange juice. Man, I LOVED that orange juice-simply the best. And the coffee was good black, always a test of quality. The menu is small and due to the lack of veggies with the breakfast (does cheese count as a veggie?), I went with sweet instead of savoury. I got the belgian waffle (an option of fruit would have taken this to a whole 'nother level, btw) and WOW-but-ter-ry. I think made with real buttermilk too. With butter melting on top. Was the maple syrup made with butter too? Possible. I think maybe all of Matts Big Breakfast may be made of butter...mmmmm. It was so rich I really had to leave one lone piece on my plate. I could not eat it. Really. COULD NOT-immediate expulsion from the clean plate club. Totally ashamed of my inability for the MBB money shot.  Nice asides:  The taters are with caramelized onions and rosemary sprigs-HOLLA. I asked to have the bacon substituted with the afore-mentioned, and the waitress said that wasn't possible-but she did deduct buck and some change from the price of the waffle, which as a veggie I deeply appreciate-CLASSY Parking lot and parking on street.  Bonus: Cute children will linger around your table and smile, much like nervous men at bars with bottles instead of beers, and not say much, making your experience alternate between unbearably cute and creepy."}
{"text":"All in all, good breakfast joint . Little parking but you can find metered parking on street. We had a the special egg scramble of the day and the cheesy omelette. And the Toast and jam was great ! A little salty for my taste but I'd come again."}
{"text":"The line is always out the door and around the corner. The food wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Great downtown spot & in the Arts district. It is an easy walk to other local downtown spots & the food is always on point."}
{"text":"This was the first time that I ordered eggs Benedict and it came to perfection. Everything is fresh and delicious. The staff are friendly and prompt. I do recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had eaten at MBB downtown once and was a fan of the food they served there. I really am behind the city's initiative to encourage local successful restaurants to open up locations in Sky Harbor airport, and Matt's Big Breakfast is a treat! They also have Lolo's Chicken n' Waffles, Deluxe Burger and Chelsea's Open Kitchen to name a few local fav spots that we frequent in town and at PHX. MBB is precisely what it sounds like Big Breakfasts. Keep in mind, it is located at Terminal 4 AFTER YOU CLEAR SECURITY.  Whatever tickles your first meal of the day fancy can be tickled deeply and thoroughly here. The menu is a true journey through morning comfort food presented in more bountiful and gourmet style that your regular combo #6 at your local slop n' drop diner. Last time I ate there before a flight I had a massive omelette with rosemary potatoes (which are amazing btw). My wife had poached eggs and off the bone ham which seemed to have come right from the farm! The only caution I would give is to make sure you have time to have a sit-down-and-order mea. The service is pretty fast but the clients come in waves and everyone seems to need to catch the same flight. l had to chase down our server to run my card as it seemed everyone in the place was trying to pay at once and were likely mostly on the same flight so be sure you're not in a photo-finish situation to your gate. For those in a rush, I think they also have a walk-up counter and sling breakfast sammies to go for those wanting to stink up economy class with their brought-on food...a practice I abhor. I never bring hot food onto a plane. It's rude. Bring a cold sandwich or a salad and leave your stinky McRaunchy's or Blazing burritos in the terminal! MBB...come hungry and then enjoy your post breakfast drooling coma as you soar the clear blue skies!"}
{"text":"If you take nothing else from my review of Matt's, hear this.  GET THE OFF-THE-BONE HAM!  Get it.    I love this place, it is my go to breakfast spot.  I've taken family and I've taken friends and the reviews are always A+  I am a basic breakfast guy.  I like cured meats, over easy eggs, potatoes and toast.  The hog and chick breakfast does each of the above elements as well as I can imagine.  If I lived closer I would be here twice a week.  Do yourself a favor and go!"}
{"text":"Came in For Breakfast, I Tried the Breakfast Sandwich it was good! Included Bacon, Egg & Cheese I loved there House Potatoes had a lot of flavor to them. The Pork chop and eggs is a good choice as well. The coffee was a bit too strong and I wanted to try there biscuits & gravy but unfortunately they only serve those on Tuesdays and I came in on Saturday (bummer) the waitress explained to us that everyday there's a breakfast special and it can only be served on that day which doesn't make sense, they should be able to serve it everyday and maybe just one day make it at a discounted price since its the special of the day."}
{"text":"It's an ok breakfast place.  The place is overhyped.  This is no different than what I can make myself.  The coffee is ok.  I was disappointed they did not offer real cream with it.  Instead, it's organic milk only.  The hash brown were mushy on the inside.  The waffle is nothing special.  If you want some quality breakfast, go to Butterfield's."}
{"text":"We had just landed in Phoenix for Spring Break/ Spring Training. My husband had heard about Matt's Big Breakfast on one of his podcasts that he listens to so I thought we'd try it.  Saturday late morning....PLEASE be prepared to WAIT. It was a little over an hour for a group of 6. Altho the empty tables sat dirty for a while - so maybe they were short on bussers. The wait wasn't too bad because you can walk along the lake, sit in the grass and enjoy the architecture of the State Farm campus.   We were seated inside, and our waitress was super cool. I have to forewarn you; the actual menu itself is pretty limited. 10 items max for breakfast and maybe 6-7 sandwhich/lunch items. Their ice tea was delish. I ordered the special that was a \"chicken enchilada sausage\" scramble with jalapenos. Yum! But even better than that were their breakfast potatoes. YUM! My husband ordered a side of bacon, but by the time I was ready to try it - he had eaten it all! HAHA!   I love the area, and the food was yum, so I would probably come back!"}
{"text":"This doesn't belong in an airport. If you only have 45 minutes to connect you won't make it.   We ended up getting it to go and barely got our flight. Others had to just leave without their food."}
{"text":"This a great place if you are in need of a great tasting, hardy breakfast.  We ended up arriving there with a large party.  Wait time was crazy since it was a Sunday.  But it was definitely worth the wait.  I ordered the steak and eggs and my wife order the chorizo and eggs.  Both were delicious!  The steak was just how I wanted it.  You can tell that their coffee was freshly brewed and it came in endless amounts.  There was only a couple issues with this place.  The place was loud and they don't have the technology to split the bills.   Other than that, a definite joint my friends and family would return to."}
{"text":"We came to Matt's Big Breakfast on a Friday around 8:30. It was packed, but we were seated without a wait. I had the skinny which was chicken sausage, egg whites, spinach and cheese scramble served with a side salad. Dining Partner had the cheese omelet with home fries. The hash browns would have been the way to go. Good service, food came out quickly. Solid breakfast spot in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Second visit to Matt's. Thought I would give it one more try. The food is ok. I might even say good, but service is always my issue. Wasn't my best experience but when I expressed my dissatisfaction Chelsi was all over it and I appreciate her immediate response."}
{"text":"I don't normally think of food at the airport as a great place to have breakfast. However, I have been proved wrong this morning.  What a little surprise in the middle of the airport. This place is taking breakfast seriously. I don't feel I am being given sub par food for an exorbitant amount of money. If this was a restaurant anywhere else, I would go back again.  Our servers name was Matthew. Although they are very busy, and I can see why, he is a great waiter and very attentive. Awesome service and a True professional.   I must say that the bacon is awesome. Nice big piece of meat very peppery.  The porkchops were amazing as well. The art of cooking eggs is not over looked here. They know the difference between an over medium and an over easy egg.  Would you like toast with your breakfast, don't expect the generic toast that you get in every restaurant across America. Beautiful thick slices of great read. The sourdough bread was absolutely amazing, and I'm from the San Francisco area.The raspberry preserves were amazing and tasted house made.   My hats are off to the manager and the staff at this restaurant. Job very well done. We are very pleased!!!"}
{"text":"Omg. I went here with my family and got the egg whites with spinach, chicken sausage, and house salad. So good!!!!!!! This place is small but mighty and has amazing breakfast. I am all about the atmosphere and this place has a great one!"}
{"text":"We dropped our daughter off at work today so that we could use her car to drive to the mountains for a hike. She highly recommended Matt's for breakfast on our way back to the hotel. This is a great find and a MUST when you are in Phoenix. Especially if you're fueling up for a mountain hike. We pulled in at 7:15 and we're back in the car at 7:55. In those 40 minutes we had great food (daily scramble for husband and waffle + bacon for me) and top-notch service (friendly, attentive, and FAST) in a really comfy and happy environment. And good coffee too! Two more days in Phoenix? Maybe two more visits to Matt's."}
{"text":"I really like Matt's Big Breakfast. The bacon is so delicious and so is the coffee. I would prefer the breakfast potato's be cut a little smaller and cooked a little more tender, but that is minor. My only complaint it how noisy it is. You really can't carry on a conversation at all. I think they need to add something to deaden the noise. It's a little better if you sit at the bar by the window."}
{"text":"It's a cool cozy spot. Eating here I feel like it's false advertising though. It's called \"Matt's BIG Breakfast,\" more like \"Matt's BIG Priced Breakfast,\" the portion was really small for the price. Got the two eggs, bacon, hash brown, and sourdough bread combo for about $10. The food was good, but still left feeling a little hungry still. Overall it was a good experience, the service was on point, and the place was clean. I would of gave them 5 stars but like I said the portions wasn't up to par with the price."}
{"text":"The bacon is - amazing, thick and perfectly cooked. The waffles are surprisingly delicious. The maple syrup is genuine and not the commercial stuff that you buy at the grocery store. I found Matt's by accident. Then I mentioned it to locals and they all said, \"YES!\" it's the place to go for breakfast."}
{"text":"Good coffee, fresh orange juice, delicious waffle, and fabulous brunch. They also have homemade jam for toasts. And I really like their sausage. Downside is there is a waiting line most of the time. However, it's worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Worth the trek and worth the wait!  Thanks to my D D& D app (thanks Guy!) I found out about Matt's while in Phoenix and convinced my sweet boyfriend to take a detour downtown and, yes, wait a while to have breakfast.  It was worth every minute!  The pancakes were absolutely fantastic and I'm the ultimate pancake snob.  They were possibly the best pancakes I've ever eaten.  You could taste the batter.  Don't know how else to describe it.  They were just the freshest most batter-y tasting pancakes I've had in years.  Orgasmically good! I also got a decaf, which was fantastic.  My boyfriend loved his omelette.  Mine was actually just OK, not great, but the pancakes, coffee and service made up for it, 100%.  Our server at the counter was a hoot and although super busy, kept us refilled and entertained.  Real maple syrup.  Yay!"}
{"text":"We went to Matt's on a Wednesday morning and it was packed.  The wait was relatively quick however as they turn people over quickly.  I had basted eggs, hash browns, and bacon with sourdough toast.  All the ingredients were excellent quality and cooked to perfection.  The jams were homemade and there were 2 offered though they only bring strawberry to the table.  I requested the blueberry and they gladly brought some at my request.  Both were excellent, but I preferred the blueberry.  The bread was also homemade and was also great.  All in all, well worth the wait and drive."}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwich here called the Five Spot. And yes, it hit the spot!  Came in around 11am with one of my frat bros. It looked busy, but we were greeted and seated right away. Friendly staff.   Also recommend the Honey Lemonade, but heads up--they don't do free refills!"}
{"text":"Hands down it is the best Breakfast place in the phoenix metro. I came all the way from Maricopa, AZ to check this place out. I'm not a native Arizonan, but this place competes up there with all the breakfast places I've been to. The pork chop is is awesome! I was lucky enough to be the last guy that made it through the door when it opened hehe."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. Matt was there and he didn't even talk to people, he seems like he doesn't care. I am all for supporting local businesses because they show they care but he didn't. Food is overrated, I heard it was the best but it's comparable to Denny's."}
{"text":"I was a bit turned off by the place at first because it's menu is so small, but I soon forgot about that. A limited menu is fine when the establishment does the menu items well, and they do. We ordered breakfast sandwiches and they were DELICIOUS, and a great value. The bacon was cut thick, the bread was warm and soft and croissant-like, and the eggs were hot. I would definitely go back and get this again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Phoenix. Everything is simple and flavorful with top notch ingredients. Be prepared to wait a while to get in though."}
{"text":"I travel a lot and this is by far the very best in airport food if not in all of burger-dom.  I picked this place at random as it was near my gate and I am so glad I did.  The food and service were outstanding.  I sat at one of the high top tables.  Plenty of room for my bag under my feet sitting there.  It was lunch so I ordered a burger.  I ordered straight from the menu, but many people requested special needs burgers and they were happy to comply.   My burger came out fast, it was cooked to perfection, very flavorful, well seasoned and just the right temperature.  My iced tea was fresh and clean.  My server, Valentin, was top notch.  A fun guy who took care of everyone with special requests and understood that in an airport environment people need to eat fast and pay fast.  He made each person around me feel special and like they were his only customer.  I can't explain it. Some people just have a gift of working with the public.  He offered to get me a to go cup of iced tea.  He is now a friend for life.  I fly into Phoenix a lot so I will be a regular customer here and, in fact, look forward to it being a highlight of future trips.  It's that good."}
{"text":"This place did a great job with a small space. The good had big flavor and our whole family enjoyed it. Waffles, pancakes, and even Mac and Cheese. It was also very hip."}
{"text":"Bravo Matt's Big Breakfast! What a great meal we had during our first trip to this place. We both got the Saturday Special which was a scramble with chicken enchilada sausage, eggs, home fries, jalapeños, cheese, and a flour tortilla. The plate was bursting with fresh tasting flavors. The wait was only about 35 min. He food is worth the wait. I love Snooze but I have to say this place beats it in flavor and quality of food. Snooze has a wider range of selections tho. My only knock against Matt's would be the limited choices on the menu. The entire staff was great and the service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Waited for 40 min to get breakfast and once seated had a non existent waitress. The host and busboy basically helped us after 4 other parties that were behind us. Found out they pool the tips so really not much incentive for good service. Food is good but otherwise not impressed. Certainly not worth the wait to be treated as though we are invisible.   Edit: the manager was kind enough to take care of us. The food is very good. Worth the wait had the service not been so non existent. Hopefully it was just a fluke."}
{"text":"Highly recommend!  Got the Tuesday's special biscuit and gravy with fresh blackberry lemonade!  My servers name was Daniel he was fast, kind and very knowledgeable. Overall a great experience!  If your from Arizona or just passing by I would make sure to put it on your list!"}
{"text":"Fast service! Food was fresh and good. Not huge portions, but no too little either. The staff was friendly. Didn't wait long for a table of two. New to area so we wanted to check this place out cause of all the hype."}
{"text":"After waiting 30 minutes and being the 4th person on the list to get seated, when asked if we could sit at the bar where there were at least 10 seats open we were told that they couldn't seat anyone at the bar because the kitchen was behind. What?? If you're behind tell the patrons up front. Too bad we actually went out of our way to eat here."}
{"text":"Food was okay, place was tight and small very busy though so thats why I decided to eat here. The charge $2 for extra syrup because i ordered kids pancakes for my friends son which where dry. I got an omelette which i felt i could make better at home. The food lacked seasoning alot it was all very bland. Across the table we all got different items to experience the menu and this was our first and last time. I have had worst trust me but nothing worth coming back for."}
{"text":"What's better than a waffle as a late brunch when you have a layover at 3:00 pm? I don't care where you are in Terminal 4, this place deserves your business. My server was friendly and prompt. The waffle I ordered was hot and delicious. The bacon was crunchy and flavorful. It satisfied my breakfast sugar craving.   4 out of 5 stars, because the food took longer than expected and there were a lot of crumbs and pieces of paper on the floor. The waffle could have been slightly crisper also. Overall, I would go back if I'm in the mood for breakfast food."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my wife for breakfast before boarding our flight. It's a small place so expect to wait sometimes when they are busy about 30 min. So I recommend planning ahead to arrive at the airport early so you get to try this amazing food.  The pancake was amazing nice and fluffy with just the right amount of very subtle crispiness. What else can I say about BACON!!! BACON ROCKS and the bacon here is a little thick, crispy, and very tasty! The home fries are seasoned and cooked with friend onions so if you don't like onions might want to let them know.   Our server was Tim and he was AWESOME. Great personality, friendly, and just a cool guy.  Highly recommend visiting this great place!"}
{"text":"Used to be a alright place when they opened but they had a horrible dip in quality recently and so now I will try to avoid this place.  I ordered a Cobb salad like i usually do and its typically decked out with olives, 1 to 2 eggs sliced in, blue cheese scattered through out, a big piece grilled chicken laying on top, dressing, lot of their bacon chopped in and freshly sliced tomatoes.  Well I think they have switched to more of a fast food format because when I went there for lunch like usual and ordered it again, I was baffled and thought at first I got the wrong order so I went back and returned it because it just looked like plain piled on lettuce with dressing mixed in, the person working at the front noticed too and said it may have been due to a new employee so had it redone. So I brought to try and eat it again as he assured me that he saw it get made this time and it was done correctly.  And it wasnt, it was disgusting. The chicken was diced and kinda tasted like cold packaged white chicken that was just poured at the bottom, and not much of it at that maybe like 2 fork fulls if I were to attempt to stab every little squared diced piece.  The tomatoes were now also diced and again like 2 fork fulls worth tasted like they were again just bought pre done at a grocery store although there was so little mixed in it was hard to tell. No olives. A single chunk of cheese not spread throughout probably about the size of a quarter. Half of an egg sliced into 3 sections sitting on top of the salad. 2 Teaspoons of crumbled bacon. And a whole lot of romaine lettuce. And 2 packages of dressing on the side.  Like what the heck happened o.o how does a place go downhill that fast. I could understand a cheap $2 premade side salad being like that but not a main menu item that im paying $11 for on a salad. I didnt go back to return it a 2nd time as apparently this is just the quality of the food they serve now and the guy that works the register at the front is just always so nice that itd be kinda weird to cause a stink over this again as I know it wasnt his fault its prepared like that now. Oh well. :/"}
{"text":"Service was Good got in pretty fast  .. Got Hog and Chick   Eggs were good  Bacon wasn't my favorite wanted it way crisp  and wasn't  and potatoes  were my least favorite seems like they were cooked ahead of time  and they were just BLAGH     and im a big time potato girl ..   toast was good Jam was good little runny    over all was ok  i might go back one more time  and try different choice  but  not sure when . for all the reviews i read  i dont think it should get more than 3  but that's just my experience..PS  i did think prices were some what high for the quality of the food   but thats just me"}
{"text":"I asked for poached eggs,  he brought me scrambled, after a long wait, he came back with COLD poached eggs. Ugh.  No excuse for that.  Also he said \"I'll take care of that for you\" and it was not removed from the bill.  Unimpressed!  The potatoes and the toast were good but that's about it."}
{"text":"food was spot on service was friendly and comforting only drawback is no alcohol served... the bottomless coffee was at a nice drinkable temperature and was strong!! the butterrrrrrr. so buttery...yummmmmmmy the 8oz orange juice for kids were served in cute plastic cups! the fruit infused water while you wait in the AZ heat was refreshing"}
{"text":"This place is great, food and service is very good. The wait is a bit long to be seated but well worth it.. The home fries are my favorite potatoes.."}
{"text":"Found on Yelp and Guy's Triple D. Hard to find because they moved and there are One Way streets. Worth the search. Big Fresh Hearty breakfast. Really enjoyed. Staff brisk, not busy time, but courteous."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try Matt's Big Breakfast but every time I went to the downtown location it was packed and I had to wait too long,  which increased my curiosity.   I learned of new location of Matt's this morning at 32nd  Street & Camelback and I had to go for it. It was packed on Friday morning at 9:30 and I thought, wow they must have some great food.  I took a look at the menu and was disappointed.  I saw only a few choices and a daily special of scrambled egg surprise.  The waitresses were friendly, the coffee was great but the food was only okay.  The sausage links are nothing I would order again but the bread they used for toast was tasty but it was too wide for my liking at breakfast.  The  preserves were great, but only one selection that day, no strawberry today.  The prices were about the same I find everywhere else around town.  I would have like to see a bigger selection on the menu, like eggs benedict...my curiosity has now been satisfied with my only visit to this restaurant.  Your missing it."}
{"text":"Ate here Fall 2015 and enjoyed it. Would definitely go back if I'm ever at the Phoenix airport again."}
{"text":"Was out in Phoenix for a business trip and found this place thru Yelp (obviously)... Cute breakfast/brunch place... Small in size, but what I'm used to for a place like this. Decoration and table condiments cute...salt & pepper shakers are like little mason jars. Okay the food... I had the daily special which was the normal Eggs Benedict. It was decent, nothing to write home about...the Hollandaise sauce was waaaay too lemoney for my taste but the potatoes were delicious."}
{"text":"Had great expectations after highly recommended by others. The breakfast was good, nothing extraordinary though. The service was a disappointment, server was very forgetful and put off by some simple requests. It doesn't look like they need my business though, considering the line to get in. I probably wont be back."}
{"text":"French Toast and eggs is absolutely delicious here! Breakfast lovers this is a must stop shop! Five stars all day!"}
{"text":"was in town for a convention and was so surprised how good the food in phoenix was!  Coming from the LA area, you become kind of a food snob, but Matt's Big Breakfast beats all.    The BEST Belgium waffle I have ever had. Wait was a little long on the Saturday morning for a table for 3, but it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Unclear what all the fuss is about. I certainly wouldn't stand in line for this place. There was nothing too interesting on the menu. I had pancakes. They were fair. Wouldn't get them again. The server at the counter was very pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"For some reason, we hit Phoenix on the first rainy day since October but that did not deter us from checking out Matt's Big Breakfast based on all the Yelp raves.  We had to wait outside for about 10-15 minutes in the rain, but finally got two seats at the bar.  When people describe this place as tiny, think 8 small tables and 6 bar stools tiny.  Do not try with groups...it will not work.  The waitress behind the counter was a riot telling people to \"Smile, it's Christmas!\"  She definitely kept the spirits up.  Our service was great, but we were at the counter where coffee was readily available.  First impression was that the coffee was great.  It is local, fresh and delicious.  My husband's waffle was really good but I won with the cheese omelette with mushrooms, onion and bacon.  It was full of gooey cheese and my husband helped me polish it off.  The hashbrowns were good, but a little greasy and the sourdough was perfect.    Bottom line - it is worth the trek downtown if you are on vacation or do not live downtown.  Good simple breakfast with plenty of butter for you arteries to soak up."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand the hype for this place. It's just breakfast, nothing special."}
{"text":"Great waffle. Great bacon  great hash browns.  This works for me. Put this together with friendly, attentive service and you have a winner"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place!!! The taste of the food was amazing.  I had the five spot sandwich with homefries and it was delicious.  The service was fast and the people were very friendly.  One of the best breakfast restaurants I've visited in the valley."}
{"text":"This airport location is an insult to the actual restaurant. First, like all airport restaurants, this was overpriced. The chili bowl was extremely small and I ordered a side of steak fries. There were less than 10 fries. To make things worse, I waited 25 minutes for takeout.   I had to eat the chili on the plane because I didn't have time. The staff did not pack my oyster crackers and the chili was small and way too salty.  The fries lacked taste. I loved the Phoenix Matt's Big Breakfast and hated this one."}
{"text":"I usually steer-clear of places that are rumored to have a long ass wait but my Mama selected this place for her birthday brunch, needless to say it was a yummy breakfast. We got there around 815 and were seated around 9, so if youre being leisurely, its worth the wait.  The menu is small and concise, making it somewhat easy to decide; it all looks and sounds so good. But it's all pretty basic meals with a couple of daily specials. One of which I had; scrambled eggs, jalapenos, cheese, onions, and a shit ton of delicious, partnered with home-fries and a tortilla. The jalapenos were just right and so fresh! We also had tried some of the walnut, raisin bread toast; which was fantastic. My boyfriend had the waffle which was good but I could tell he could use another one ($8 for one waffle?). I don't eat swine too often but the bacon was heavenly; thick and peppered. One thing I do regret about the meal was I saw someone order some chocolate milk, definitely should've got some instead of coffee; what's the rush to wake up on a Sunday anyway?  When we came out, some people who had been waiting near us, were asking what we got and how it was. It seemed our leaving Matt's got everyone outside's mounths watering. Everyone lit up to hear our reviews, which I thought was pretty funny...So all-in-all it was good but nothing so amazing (which is what I've heard about this place). Great for a special occasion or once in awhile."}
{"text":"Yes, sometimes you have to wait in a long line. No, the line isn't that long if you don't come on a weekend (like everyone else does).  Yes, get whatever special they have on the board for the day. And damn well better get 2 or 3 glasses of that fresh squeezed OJ. All the waiting is worth just that alone."}
{"text":"After eating here I simply cannot understand the hype. It's kind of like the whole restaurant has a chip on its shoulder. The only positive is that our wait was short and the food came to the table in a timely manner. I ordered the Hog & Chick with bacon, over easy eggs, and home fries . The bacon was incredibly overcooked and splintered into individual fibers in my mouth. I've completely burned bacon before and it tasted better than this. The eggs had no flavor and were somehow watery. The home fries were decent, but there were multiple, half inch long Rosemary stems in  the way which provided a challenge to eat around. Final point of contention is that nothing can be subbed. I have a gluten intolerance and asked if anything could be subbed for the toast that came with the meal...nope. I get that some restaurants think gluten intolerance is a bunch of hoo ha and don't want to cater to that particular group of eaters, but in my thinking, as long as the sub is of equal or lesser value to the toast, why not? Matt's clearly doesn't agree. Regardless, I don't believe I shall return. No big loss."}
{"text":"Wow. I stumbled across this place on a layover, and to be honest, didn't have high expectations since it's airport food, right? I was so wrong-fresh orange juice, thick peppered bacon, awesome home fries, and big pieces of homemade wheat bread toasted just right, with delicious raspberry jam. It was a little pricey, but nothing out of the norm for an airport restaurant. I'm flying through PHX again in a few weeks, and I'll definitely walk however far to eat here again."}
{"text":"You are in for a treat if you don't mind an hour+ wait!  Cute little place with good service. My favorite dish is the the Chop and Chick.  Definetly worth a try and if you're really lucky you might get to witness a drunken bum fight in their parking lot."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I hate waiting in line.  If I could, I would get an intern just to wait in line for me.  Having said that, I have waiting in line more than once for breakfast here.  The food is delicious.  I'm not sure if its the copious amounts of butter in the food but I swear it is the best toast and breakfast potatoes in town.  Oh and the main dishes are great too.  The place is tiny, and they really didn't spend much money on decor.  But really, who cares when breakfast is this delicious?!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast period!  Quality, experience, value, service etc. etc. etc....menu is short and to the point so makes it simple to order. Pork chop is the best item to order and their bacon is bangin!!! Yes slang is the best option to describe their bacon and overall experience."}
{"text":"What can I say.... I LOVE MATT'S BIG BREAKFAST! Everything I have had there has been fabulous.  The atmosphere is friendly. The food, while traditional, old fashioned comfort breakfast, which has the real butters and goodies that make their wonderful recipes taste so yummy, it is absolutely, hands down the best breakfast place I know! I am hooked on their waffles! If you go during peak times, expect a wait.  There are many dedicated Matt's aficionados."}
{"text":"WOW. There isn't one thing I could complain about. The wait was worth it (our fault for going to breakfast on a Sunday at 10 AM). The service was great, the hash browns were great, toast was good, waffles were AMAZING. Fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious, their fresh preserves were even better. They had the best ketchup money could buy (sir kensingtons).. Hell, even their butter was delicious! Well done, Matt. Now come to Portland, Oregon, we need breakfast joints like you."}
{"text":"Seriously, what the fuck are you people waiting in those long ass lines for?  Did I miss something?  Are they giving handies in the restroom... wait... do they even have a restroom?  It's so small, it's impossible to not have people in your personal bubble and who wants strangers breathing on them when they're trying to eat?  The servers are these bitchy girls that argue with each other and one looked so dirty I wanted to squirt her with my hand sanitizer each time she passed by me.    The food - it's a normal breakfast.  Nothing about the meal made me think I was having something special.  Yes, the bacon was good but really, have you ever had bad bacon?  They don't have fountain drinks, just canned RC so I stuck to coffee."}
{"text":"Absolutely not worth the wait. I've given two tries... done. Has to be the worst breakfast in town."}
{"text":"Went here after everyone I know in phx recommended it.   Space. Felt very temporary and cold.  But that doesn't effect the review.  I'm assuming maybe it is?  Service.  Solid.  Was greeted by friendly staff and the server was nice and helpful.   Food. Got the chop and eggs.  Eggs are eggs.  They were good.  And I liked my cottage cheese, but it probably came from a tub so whatever.  Hash brown was great, super tasty.  Chop. No flavor. Unseasoned.  Bland to the point that I had to cover with ketchup,  which is a shame BC I'm sure they get great product.  Wife got the waffle.  Super good.  Anyways.  3 stars BC its good not great.  Nothing I would go out of my way to come back for.  But if someone asked me for a solid breakfast spot I'd still recommend."}
{"text":"This is a cute little breakfast place located in downtown, I've read great yelps and decided to give it a try. The service is great! The prices are fair, I tried this breakfast sandwich and it was only 6 bucks! The quality was good, and the bacon is to die for!"}
{"text":"Had some of the softest freshest waffles ever! They literally melt in your mouth!! And, the thickest most delicious bacon.....now, my mouth is watery!!"}
{"text":"Everything everybody says about Matt's is true. A fabulous breakfast with good service.  The hog and chick is the way to go. Go after 9:30 during the week to avoid wait time."}
{"text":"everything was sooo fresh and the service was great. Fresh organic apple juice to go with chop n chick!   crowded and I know why the food is impeccable cooked perfectly"}
{"text":"I've been trying to get over to Matt's for some time - but since I live in Chandler, it's not often that I'm in Phoenix during breakfast hours.  That said, boy oh boy was it worth the extra 30 minute drive.  Everything was spot on.  The service, the food, the ambiance - just wow.  We got there close to closing time, so they were out of a few things, but that's to be expected when they're so busy.  Probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had - and the pancake is in the top three of all time.  Very few restaurants bother with real maple syrup, but for me it makes all the difference.  The bacon was up near the top I've ever had, and I will be back as often as possible.  Simply put, it's the best breakfast destination in Phoenix, period."}
{"text":"Matts big breakfast has some very excellent breakfast options. I've never been disappointed. But even if their food was just ok, I would still continue to go back just for the bacon. It is the best bacon I've ever had at any restaurant or home!"}
{"text":"Stopped at this place for breakfast and drinks when heading home from a work/play trip. The food was great but the alcohol was even better ! Try the Bloody Mary, it contains the full package. Bacon, olives, celery, cheese blocks, it is like a meal with a side of booze ! It gets very busy !"}
{"text":"This is a quintessential breakfast joint even though they serve lunch also. I have had breakfast here a couple of times and have been very happy. In addition to their menu they also feature a daily special.  Earlier this morning I tried their 3 egg scrambler (today's daily special) and it was superb. Scrambled eggs with habaneros, protein and choice of potatoes (I chose hash browns).  The eggs were delightfully prepared, not too soft and not too well done. Just right. Big pieces of habanero were intimidating but had just the right amount of heat. The hash browns were excellent: crispy exterior and nice and soft inside. One big slab of goodness. BTW, great coffee too.  The restaurant is small so expect a wait. But it's well worth it."}
{"text":"This will make me the most unpopular man in Phoenix, but I just don't get why such a big deal is made about this place.  Is it good? Sure.  Is it worth waiting in line for? Not really."}
{"text":"A huge waste of time.  The host guy was funny to watch, but not at all effective in getting tables turned and seated, and seems to believe his low level job gives him a pass to be rude to customers. I'm fairly sure they intentionally stretch out the wait to create a false sense of demand and hype.  There were always 3-4 empty tables while cranky people waited as if at the DMV.  The food is fine, service is a bit awkward and certainly nothing worth putting up with their complete lack of urgency.  It makes customers upset to feel like there's no priority in taking care of them.  Hospitality 101 failure."}
{"text":"Simply good food--great ingredients and wonderful service.  Yes, the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Big Country - In A Big Country)  I've never really eaten breakfast without the season Another coffee ordered through Another bacon passes by me  You never took the smile away from anybody's face And that's an appetizing way to look  For someone who is just a Yelper  At Matt's Big Breakfast foods stay with you  Like a hungry voice fires the griddlecakes Stay hungry!   Matt's Big Breakfast is now located in Tempe, but with not 1, not 2, but 3 locations popping; this local breakfast joint is the place to be!  I'm sure they're working on expanding to another!  I came with a group of runners after a quick run!  The place was banging with patrons and we had to wait another hour just to get seated.  Needless to say, I couldn't wait cause as the food passed us by and the smell of coffee; man I tell ya I was hungry!!    When we finally sat, I ordered some coffee and beer of course to carb load!  I proceeded with The Hog & Chick breakfast; 2 eggs, 3 slices of bacon, hash browns, and wheat toast.  I also got the griddlecakes on the side just to try it.  Overall, a solid \"Big\" breakfast cause portions are not lacking here; I can hear Julia Child now, more butter!  The hash browns were crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.  The bacon was meaty and salty to the bite.  The eggs I liked over-easy and indeed it was.  I got some wheat toast which was thick like Texas toast, but I ate it as I progressed to my griddlecakes; which was sweet and toasty along with my warm maple syrup!  My friend ordered the Skinny; 4 eggs whites scrambled with gruyere cheese, spinach, and chicken apple sausage, served with a side salad.  She enjoyed her breakfast except the salad became soggy with dressing.    In the end, Matt's Big Breakfast did deliver some solid breakfast, but nothing spectacular.    Service was decent and the overall atmosphere was popping.  I rather enjoyed my breakfast and it was done the right way.  I appreciate them using local and organic products in Phoenix so that's always a plus in my books! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ok, I have to admit I'm a secret admirer of Matt's delicious ever so crunchy, thick and well seasoned bacon!! Bacon, Bacon, Bacon is what keeps me coming back to Matt's Big Breakfast and of course their pancakes, pork chops, omelets, hash browns, home fries...  This place is small as many Yelpers have stated already and no thanks to Guy and his \"Triple D\" it's hard to find the right time to come to Matt's with out having to wait due to all the foodie followers of Food Network.    The service at Matt's is what you make of it. If your in a rush, let your server know and she will accommodate you, but if you don't say anything you'll wait for refills.   As many Yelpers have already stated their food is amazing!  Matt uses the freshest ingredients, most of which are organic and locally grown.  I had something not on their normal menu: scrambled eggs with sliced chorizo, jalapeños and cheesy goodness with a side of their hash browns, toast and of course bacon!  It was FANTASTIC! Great combination and it wasn't spicy at all!  Ask for it when you go, you must try it!! They bacon and chorizo are made special for Matt at a market.  He uses Wildflower's bread and the egg and veggies are all from local farmers.  Recommendation:  Stacy C is right, the best time to come is during the week and in the early or late morning.  Plan a business breakfast in lieu of a luncheon.  We went last week and the three of us had problem finding a table, be it a small table : -)"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place, everything is so good it is totally worth the line you see on the weekend! You should always try the specials the offer and the jam!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in the entire world (and i am a New Yorker who has been to many breakfast places). The eggs are amazing but the hash browns and toast are incredible. The toast is the best toast i have ever had in my life and i wish i could eat it every day!!!"}
{"text":"3.5stars. What can I say about Matt's that hasn't already been said? Generous portions, fresh ingredients, seriously amazing toast. I never thought the day would come when I'd rave about toast, but Matt's thick-cut toasted wheat toast with homemade blueberry compote is what I crave when I think about homey brunch food now.   This downtown location has a small parking lot of its own. The inside is decently sized, but lines are out the door for lunchtime and brunch most days, weekdays included. Service is mediocre, not the most attentive because it's always bustling in here, and there have been a few times where I've needed to aggressively flag down a server to ask for coffee refills or to-go boxes.   Matt's has a small menu, but there are specials for each day of the week. The menu items stay consistent, and the daily specials are written up on a huge chalkboard at the back of the restaurant.   Drinks: Coffee is decent and comes with bottomless refills. The strawberry lemonade and honey lemonade are both really good and not too sweet, although they come with quite a lot of ice.   The Hog and Chick: Standard breakfast fare, this comes with two eggs, choice of meat, choice of hash browns or home fries, and a slice of thick-cut toast. The hash browns are made well, and I like the crunchy exterior and soft interior. I did notice that the first time I came, the hash browns were made perfectly and the second time they were slightly mushy in the center. Still good though. I tried the sausage links, and I don't know that I'd order them again.. maybe I'll opt for the ham next time. Eggs were well-cooked with a nice runny center.  Salami scramble: This comes with scrambled eggs and salami (additional toppings for extra charge), hash browns or homefries, and toast. I really like the homefries because they come with sprigs of roasted rosemary, which are incredibly flavorful. I've found the homefries to be consistent and delicious, especially with the house made thick ketchup. One thing that did disappoint me a bit was that the scramble was undercooked. When I got to the middle, the egg was still oozy and watery, which left an unappetizing puddle on the plate. I'd gotten a different scramble before where this didn't happen, but I think the chef probably just underestimated the cook time by a minute.   Cheese omelet: This omelet was so cheesyyyy. I thought the flavor was really good, and I really recommend adding in toppings (for an extra charge) because it really helps balance out the cheesiness and richness. I did find the inside a tad runny again, but it wasn't super noticeable with the cheese mixing in. This dish again comes with choice of potatoes and toast.   Toast: The toast here is so good it deserves its own mention. The thick-cut toast comes out sliced in half and smeared with butter. One of the servers said that they use an old-fashioned toaster (which must be magical), and the slice comes out perfectly crunchy on the outside but still soft and fluffy on the inside. The blueberry compote is made with fresh blueberries and sugar, and it always tastes fresh and not too sweet. I haven't always finished my meals here, but I've always finished the toast.   I'll be back to Matt's for its convenient location and comforting breakfast food, and of course the toast."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a breakfast guy, but I've heard a lot of good things about this place, so we finally made it a point to stop in and see what all the hype was about. So, some things seem overpriced, some things seemed pretty fair. I dig the vibe of the place, though it's very small, and very loud inside. We ordered a few different things off the menu and had no complaints there. Overall, it was a good experience, and if I ever go out for breakfast again, we just may pay Matt's another visit."}
{"text":"Every Phoenix visit, I make it a point to come to Matt's. BUT... once a year is just not enough. And though my time in Phoenix is always limited, that hour and a half wait for a table is worth the wait every single time.  If you're here for breakfast, order the special. You will never be disappointed. It's usually some sort of scramble, with fresh local ingredients. The potatoes with rosemary always hits the spot. Do yourself a favor and get the LARGE freshly squeezed orange juice. The small is a tiny little thing, and if you're gonna spend the money, spend the extra buck and get more.  My favorite lunch item is the Rueben. BEST RUEBEN EVER. And I've had my share of reubens. This sandwich is magic in your mouth. The last time I had one, I decided that I also wanted breakfast, so I had them add an over-easy egg in the sandwich. That was heaven in my mouth---- I still dream of that particular sandwich.  A majority of the items on the menu are made with local ingredients (jam, bread, and coffee included). The service is ALWAYS fast and friendly. And as tiny as the place is, they turn tables quickly and keep everything immaculately clean.  I love Matts. Best breakfast in the entire state of Arizona. Oh yeah. I just said that. And I meant it."}
{"text":"A cool little spot off Tempe Town Lake. They have a small menu but it doesn't feel incomplete. The pancakes are amazing, they have daily specials, and the coffee is roasted locally! We sat at the breakfast bar and service was quick and attentive, you can tell the employees are passionate about the food. A great place if you're looking for a tasty breakfast"}
{"text":"Realizing the truth about Matt's is that they are simply short-staffed in the summer. Not sure why it is, but winter service is far more consistent (read: better). Over the past few months, when we have visited, we see some table fly right through while others just wait (we even spoke to a couple at a table next to us on the last visit who had noticed the same thing, as they had been waiting a while).   Hey -- Matt's is great and, in a few months, we'll be right back to taking winter visitors there. But, for summertime, I'll be taking a pass."}
{"text":"Came for brunch today. Sometimes service is good, sometimes it's not. Well today it wasn't. Food is always good. Had the cheesy omelette, coffee and pancake. Delicious. Will be back"}
{"text":"I ADORE this place. Matt's has been a staple breakfast, brunch, whatever place for me since I moved to Downtown 5 years ago. They just moved to a great place up the street (where Verde used to be for locals) with more room so now everything isn't so crammed! Not that we all didn't enjoy their original house, this one just says, \"I'm still awesome, I just stepped up a notch.\" Everything is delicious. I love their 5 Spot, the waffles are great, and their lunch specials are always amazing. If you like jelly - try their homemade stuff. Try the bacon."}
{"text":"On the advice of a friend stopped in for breakfast. So glad I did. Was told that at times the line is out the door. Thankfully, waltzed right in and was sat immediately at the bar area. I was not that hungry but the aroma's coming from the kitchen made my mouth water. Instead of getting a single menu item I opted from the offerings under \"On The Side\". My dish consisted of one egg over easy (perfectly cooked and tasted farm fresh), think cut bacon (oh my, simply delish) and toast with homemade preserves. It was easy to tell that the kitchen took pride in their dishes and uses only the highest quality ingredients. If I had to complain about anything would be the noise level. With so many hard surfaces conversations definitely bounce around this tiny gem. But I'll take it. Service was fast and friendly. Absolutely charming, will be back!"}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast place in the US. Worth the wait every time. And the staff always welcome me in and always say goodbye. Thanks Matt!"}
{"text":"I had a cheese omelette with spinach and onions with hashbrowns fried in butter. It was decadent. My wife had a waffle and bacon. It was amazing as well. The strawberry jam and sourdough toast were worth the trip by themselves. Great coffee and outstanding service. We had a little bit of a wait but it was well worth it. I can't eat like this every day, but that's what vacation is for, right?"}
{"text":"This location is downstairs from my work and the food is excellent.  I had the chicken sandwich and the portions were great with homemade potato chips.  I also liked the bottomless coffee.  The only concern was service was kind of poor and the waitress looked very rushed.  I would however definitely go back and breakfast is really what put Matt's on the map."}
{"text":"I arrived there at 5:30 this morning for breakfast. After finding a table that wasn't wobbly I ordered the  cheese omelette with mushrooms. It comes with toast and potatoes. The potatoes were undercooked and room temperature. The toast was room temperature and wouldn't even start to melt the butter that was put on it. They brought me a new batch of potatoes and new toast, which I appreciated. It seemed to me that the omelette was not freshly made. I've never tasted one like that before that was freshly made. From the way I was dressed it was obvious I worked at the airport and wasn't just passing through. I probably won't go there again. I am always happy to support local businesses over chain restaurants, but it was a really simple order and most of it went wrong, unfortunately. The waiter, however, was really nice."}
{"text":"Matt's is my new favorite place for breakfast. The price is right, the food is good, and the service is awesome. Let's not forget about that thick peppered bacon. It's not the healthiest food around, but who cares it tastes great. Eat, love, sleep."}
{"text":"Again, people must understand that good things (food) come to those who wait.  Imagine if Matt's Big Breakfast seated as many as a Denny's.  They'd be forced to mass cook, quality would go down and service would suffer.  True, this place COULD be a tad bigger, but you can't discount them for being delicious and popular.  The time my wife and I went, there was only a 20 minute wait, so we strolled around downtown Phoenix, visited the local organic grocer, which I highly recommend, and the time flew by.  We sat at the bar and got the inside scoop on the place as we chatted to everyone from the busboy to the owner.  And the scoop was, they are opening a high-end organic coffee shop on 5th and McDowell or Thomas,"}
{"text":"Delicious omelets, bacon, pancakes, killer yummy home fries and hash browns, fresh squeezed orange juice!!! We went on Mon @10:30am and wait time was ~15min but Food came really fast! :)"}
{"text":"This review is NOT for the food, it is for the wait.  Seriously.... 2 hours PLUS.   We sat in the hot Arizona sun with my hungry child in a questionable part of town and the only thing I received was a sun burn and major irritation from the wait. After waiting 2 hours, that was it for us.   *************************My philosophy is anything tastes pretty damn amazing when you are famished and dehydrated. ********************"}
{"text":"The BACON is sooooooooooooooooo amazing. It is a must. Did I mention the bacon? Food selections are the basics but done well. Only complaint I have is the wait at times can be very long. How about a bacon sample while I wait? One can hope."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich was money! Thick cut bacon was the star attraction! Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this place! We went on a Thursday morning and we were seated immediately. The service was quick and our waitress was friendly. We had the waffle and the eggs benedict, both were delicious! The atmosphere was great and the prices were cheap. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast should be at the top of anyone's Phoenix \"Must\" list. All of the food is locally sourced and served up so fresh you really can taste it. Everything from their kick ass bacon to their bread to their coffee and juice will knock your socks off with their freshness. It is no surprise that even on a summer's day people sit outside in the heat and wait for a table.  I'm surprised by comments about the service here because all of the girls came out to check on those of us waiting outside and even took our orders in advance so they would be prepared the moment we were seated. Everyone working there was very sweet.  My last visit was a sad one however because I was suffering from a brief but very severe hangover (what I like to call an Express Hangover) that was so bad all I could manage was a few sips of juice and coffee. If Matt's is in the future I have to make it a point to behave myself the night before because passing up such a great breakfast is a crime in this Yelper's book!"}
{"text":"ok. parking here totally sucks. luckily, we ate here early in the day, and people were leaving, so we waited a bit and took their spot. (when going downtown, carpool, people!) we were promptly seated, and just in time, as a bunch of people came in 5 minutes later, and had to wait outside.   i had the daily special of chorizo with eggs and jalapenos, my bf had the sausage and eggs combo (forgot its actual name). i personally don't really care for rosemary, but if you like it, the potatoes will rock your socks off. we were both stuffffffed. the food was incredibly hot, fresh and delish (and spicy!). service was fast... so we were happy. until we thought about how much butter we were consuming. but bc it was so yummy, that we decided we didn't care.    the homemade toast and preserves were also pretty killer. even though i was stuffed to the brim, i ended up eating my bf's last piece of toast and preserves as we walked out. they were that good.  i just wish there were more menu options..."}
{"text":"Food is very good. ALWAYS SO BUSY. Parking is hit or miss especially on weekends. My only complaint is how loud it gets. I wish there was some way to lessen the echo and noise."}
{"text":"I know better than to have high expectations when going to airport bars and was having a great time at this place. But then the bartender, Lisa was a little rude. First she rolls her eyes at me when I tell her there's an error in the check as she charged me for a more expensive vodka and I guess it was to much trouble for her to change it as she tried to downplay the error saying they were the same price when they are not. Then after I gave her what I understand is the usual $1 per (airport overpriced) drink tip, she starts acting up and being sarcastic about her service not been good and that we should let her know what she did wrong so that she can get better because we gave her such a bad tip. I honestly never had a waitress or bartender ever give me crap about my tip before I even leave the place. What a shame."}
{"text":"At Matt's you get huge portions!  I got the eggs and sausage breakfast.  They have great county potatoes!  Love the old fashion country decor."}
{"text":"Tried the waffle. It was excellent. Fluffy and great syrup. Probably one of the best I've tried. Although I wasn't a big fan of the peppered bacon."}
{"text":"Get the Hog and the Chick! No wait... The Chop and the chick...NOOO, get the special! Ok. Just get it all!! Thick cut bacon, fresh squeezed orange juice, crispy has browns, fresh preserves on sourdough toast.  Oh man, is this place good. Yes, you might have to wait a while to get seated in this TINY place, but it is worth it!   The service is very friendly and very quick.  I enjoy sitting along the window with their cute little knick knacks.    I hear the lunch menu is just as good at breakfast, but I have yet to try.  I honestly wish this place was open for dinner...\"brinner\" is my favorite meal! ;-)"}
{"text":"My mom took me here this morning after I arrived on an early-morning flight, we had a craving for coffee and a new place.  First impression: Small brick building by what looks like a roach motel and a parking lot totally full. Some really weird icky smell was in the air too..? Inside is cramped with little orange tables, totally kitsch and cute. The staff were all very friendly and made sure our orders were taken as soon as we were ready, even to the point that different waitresses were asking to make sure we had coffee on the way. The coffee's great and I was impressed with raw sugar on each table.   The menu is small [literally] and I ordered the cheese omelette [cheddar] with mushrooms and hash browns. The hash browns were ridiculously oily. They would have been tastier without so much grease. The omelette was mediocre and I could have made the same in my own kitchen.  The whole wheat toast was probably the best part of the meal, and the jam tasted homemade and flavourful. I am not used to really greasy food like I was served [nor did I expect it] and therefore could not get through half my breakfast before my stomach started aching.   The jist? Small cafe, great waitstaff, subpar diner food. Oh, and this might be good to know: there is no restroom in the place, so if you need to use one, you will have to go next door to that sketchy motel."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in phoenix! Salami eggs were great, a bit spicy and delicious! Good coffee and the bread and strawberry jam is to die for! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Always worth the wait. Food is awesome and so is the service. Definitely recommend. This spot is a tad bit small so I wouldn't recommend bringing a party bigger than 4."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast has amazing food. I always enjoy getting my breakfast or/and lunch here. The five spot is so good!! Also, the service is always great and the staff (Daniel) is always cheerful and welcoming! Thanks for the sweet experience!!"}
{"text":"The food at Matt's is quite good. My issue is with the service. I'm gluten-intolerant and so I asked for my breakfast that normally comes with potatoes and toast to have extra potatoes instead of toast. I was taken aback when the server said no substitutions were allowed, not even for food sensitivities. I understand that a small restaurant that wants to turn tables quickly may not allow substitutions for any reason, but then they should clearly state that on the menu. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Friendly service and even better food. Love that they use locally sourced foods whenever possible. My husband and I both had the \"Hog and Chicks.\" I had mine with crispy bacon - fantastic, crispy, not greasy - and eggs over easy. My husband had scrambled eggs with sausage, also excellent. Loved the homemade sour dough toast and strawberry jam. Hash browns also were good. What a gem in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"The wait was long because we went on a weekend but the food is worth it.  Their food is really good and their wait staff is great and attentive.  I could see what the fuss was about.  This place has a reputation for being busy and always crowded on weekends, but it is because the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Well, someone goofed. Shortly after I ordered one of the daily specials today someone crossed it off the board. I kept expecting someone to come back and tell me they were out, but nothing happened for 15 minutes after our ticket went into the kitchen. Finally the waitress came over and relayed the bad news. So we sat for another 10 minutes waiting for my replacement order. Come on, guys."}
{"text":"First off i absolutely love the modern decor and the laid back style of the restaurant. The menu isn't huge which means what they do they do right! My waffle was perfect and the home fries were amazing. We left full and happy."}
{"text":"It's worth avoiding LAX layovers just for this restaurant.  They have some awesome cocktails and even better food.  I love the waffle and thick bacon.  They also have an amazing grilled cheese.  Everything tastes really good and its very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"So I had the pleasure of eating at both locations while in PHX and this one out did the original!  I had this gin, lemon and soda water drink which solved my pissy attitude towards the airport :).  For food I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup and added bacon to the grilled cheese.  They had awesome buttery bread and the soup was nice and thick.  Every employee seemed like they were having a great day which helped as many of us were grumpy from canceled and delayed flight.  Prices were good so I strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"sorry, everyone else---all the crybabies that want a big place to get a table fast, absoulutely comfortable refrigirated air, and room for your party of 38.  this is not your place, so deal with it.  what it is, and the only way i found the place was doing some work about a couple blocks away, and wanted to get a good bite to eat.  nothing special, but something close.  someone on our work crew steered me here.  i went back the second day as well.  the food is fresh, plentiful, and the service--at least to me was really attentinve.  i was lucky to hit the place where i did not have to wait.    places like this are the kind that i keep coming back to.  the quality of the food that i had was very very good, and the prices are reasonable as well.  it's a cute place, but if you don't want cute, don't want to wait, and don't appreciate the kind of place that matt's it----go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast/brunch choice if you're at Sky Harbor. Waffles and Nueske's bacon were very good, my husband's Hog + Chick (eggs/bacon/toast/potatoes) was standard, and they kept the coffee coming. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good but the server was a little much. To each his own but the flamboyant flirting was quite offensive and after years of construction I am hard to offend. Since I was displeased with my service and just wanted to get out of there i opted to leave no tip. Michael our server decided to in a round about way make comments on tips and so on and so on make the experience even more awkward. Like I said food was good but the pet nick names and service made for an overall poor experience. I will stick the the original restaurant from now on."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while.  Stopped in Monday AM and didn't have to wait for a table which is rare.  I had their special which was scrambled eggs with apple sausage and spinach.  Served with hash browns and toast it was a great way to start the day."}
{"text":"By 'big breakfast' they really do mean BIG BREAKFAST. Affordable breakfast place with a straightforward menu, and a few locations scattered throughout Phoenix. We hit the 1st street location on a Monday morning, 8:30 am, and apparently beat the rush - as a party of two, we were seated immediately, but as we ate we watched with some surprise as pretty large groups kept coming in and were willing to wait for quite awhile - can they not tell it's a tiny location with primarily tables for two? As for the food, my tomatillo/eggs/tortilla/pinto beans were pretty good, though not the unforgettable experience I'd expected, judging by the other Yelp reviews which guided us here in the first place. My husband outright hated his eggs & salami scramble, describing the salami as 'rancid.' But honestly, eggs and salami together sounds awful anyway, so perhaps he should have played it safe and gotten a classic eggs & bacon option. Coffee refills slowed down as the place became more and more busy.  Anyway. We're glad we tried it as it filled us up for several hours, and it didn't break the bank."}
{"text":"Been here three or four times this year for breakfast.  Their food is very good and the portions are quite generous.  I usually split one of their omelettes and the country potatoes are delicious.  The jam for the toast is outstanding and their coffee is solid as well.  Get here early to avoid a wait on weekends and you're good to go."}
{"text":"So as I strolled through the Phoenix Airport I moved passed the regular fast food breakfast fare and came across Matt's Big Breakfast and thought \"this is the place.\"  The tables were packed and the \"to go\" line seemed to be moving quickly.  I checked my phone (25-30 minutes to boarding STARTED), read over the menu (Breakfast Burrito for the win) and got in line.    The young guy working as very nice despite the fact he was obviously SLAMMED.  I should've taken the clue that 1 guy taking all the orders, pouring all the coffee, and having to run around the bar to pick up the to go food was a harbinger of issues to come, but I forged on.  He took my name and gave me my receipt.  As time continued to pass I started forgetting who ordered what and when and I noticed the crowd outside of the restaurant continued to grow, and grow, and grow.  It was cool though, I still had 20 minutes left.  Around the 25 minutes of waiting mark I figured it was time to see if I was close.  As I waited in the line AGAIN, to check the status of my food, I noticed that 3 of the 7 people in the line were doing the same thing.  I reached the front, informed the clerk that I NEEDED my food because I'd waited 30 minutes and my plane was boarding soon.  He informed me my food was up soon.  I waited about 7-8 more minutes after that and was handed my burrito.  No bag, no napkin.  Just the burrito.  As I ran off I overheard another lady requesting a refund because she couldn't wait for her food anymore.  Once I finally boarded my plane (and had to check my bag because I was one of the last 5 people to enter it), I was ready to eat.  The burrito itself was \"meh\" at best.  The standout was the bacon, it was amazing and it was obviously this wasn't some low cost meat, I found myself wishing the rest of the burrito emulated this taste.  It didn't.  The eggs had next to no flavor and were oily, and I'm about 90% sure the potatoes were cooked in some form of olive oil as well, because that's the only taste they had.    Overall, I wished I had as great an experience as everyone else who sat down, ate and reviewed, however I wasn't so lucky.  Beyond having a friendly person, the express counter was a joke (40 minutes, that's good right?) and the burrito beyond the bacon completely lacked flavor.  Maybe it was just a bad day I attended, but I don't know if I'll roll the dice again.  If you go, make sure you have an hour plus and skip the burrito."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Phoenix hands-down! Love, love, love the Chop and chick!  The pork chop is cooked perfectly.  First time ever I've had a pork chop cooked and seasoned perfectly that I didn't make myself :)"}
{"text":"Bringith the masses and come hungry! Huge portions of comfort breakfast. Beware, you will be in a food coma after."}
{"text":"Loved the strawberry preserve on sourdough toast. The potatoes were a little under cooked though. Cool atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing!!! There are a few servers that exceed expectations every single time and one of those individuals is Daniel. Always greeting customers with a friendly smile and  concerned about the entire experience rather than just the meal. Love coming here!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just all the hype beforehand.  I had heard about this place for six years.  I was ready to be amazed.  Unfortunately it is very, very mediocre."}
{"text":"The service sucks at Matt's. Unfortunately for those of us that like good food AND good service the food is crave worthy- better than any breakfast I have ever had, so simple and so, so, yummy. That being said, I have never been to a restaurant that ran out of cream for coffee. Not only that but they made it seem like no big deal, no apologies. I had one too many bad experiences and have not been back since. I have been tempted many a time to go back and see if they have changed their evil ways, but I just can't bring myself to do it. We'll see- life is too short to hold grudges, especially when good food is involved, right?  UPDATE: Ok, we ventured back to Matt's to celebrate my birthday in April and I have to say that the service wasn't bad at all.... no more snotty waitresses, so I am adding 2 more stars. If they would make the effort to be really friendly they would get my 5th star... but I won't hold my breath, I think it is just not that kind of place. Now if you really are a thrill seeker I have a challenge for you... go to the bathroom at Matt's (go ahead and ask them where the bathroom is and you will see what I mean)... and if you want to have a good laugh imagine a nine months pregnant woman trying to go to the bathroom at Matt's... yeah, that was fun, luckily I escaped with little more than a pinch on the thigh from the toilet seat... but unless you have a death wish you should definitely empty your bladder BEFORE you go to Matt's...fair warning."}
{"text":"Literally got off our flight and were starving. We looked up some breakfast places in the area and chose Matts. The wait was a little long but it was worth it!!! The bread that came with our meal was AMAZING! The waitresses were very kind even when we had a tired screaming baby on our hands."}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea. Very sweet Rosemary potatoes, prefer garlic and green peppers. Salami scramble, unempressive. Rubbery salami and tasteless eggs. Cold coffee.  Healthy food? I would loose weight by eating a lot less, if this was my only choice."}
{"text":"I would really, really like to give Matt's more stars, but this place just doesn't do it for me (and trust me - I've been back three times in hopes of a better experience!).   Ambiance: Great! Trendy and modern, and the Marina Heights scenery is GORGEOUS! But...I wish they utilized the space a bit better. We're in the peak of patio/outdoor seating in Phoenix, and Matt's enormous patio continues to go unused with no tables or outdoor seating options!   Food: Standard. It's really good, simple fare. But...I could make it in my own kitchen (that's how simple it is). They use fresh ingredients that are sustainably sourced, so I have peace of mind there, but the menu is limited, and again - I could make lots of what they serve at home in under ten minutes.   Service: ...wish it was better. It's not that the servers are rude (and again, we've been three times, so I've seen a decent sample of what's to offer), but they don't always feel the most hospitable. I've gone long lengths of time with an empty water glass or coffee cup, and find myself flagging down waitstaff to add items to my tab. I've seen food delivered to the wrong table multiple times, and overall, just don't see the service team working well together.   So, the wrap-up is that this is a great place to try if you're not on a budget and are in the mood for a simple, no-frills breakfast meal. Expect to wait a little, spend a bit, and walk away satisfied but not blown away. Could be a great place to stop if you're taking a stroll on ASU's Tempe Campus or in the Marina Heights neighborhood and are wanting a bite!"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic service and delicious breakfast burritos. We always go here when we're in town"}
{"text":"Portions are big, tastes pretty good too. Service was relatively fast for how busy they are and the wait time is lower than other places.  We got a to go order with our meal and they left it on the counter and we had to ask for it again because we were done and still waiting for it.  Also, the $3.25 chocolate milk is a glass of milk with chocolate syrup on the inside of the cup and you have to mix it with the straw which is kinda weird. Like why am I paying so much to mix my own chocolate milk...? Lol"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast join in Phoenix. Good atmosphere, good service, and absolutely amazing breakfast food."}
{"text":"Stopped by Matt's when I was visiting from out of town and it's a solid breakfast place.   There was a long line though because it was a Saturday, but wasn't anything unbearable. I had the cheese omelette and hash brown and the portions are h u g e. The top of the hash brown was nice and crunchy (and really good after you add a little more salt and ketchup) but the inside was a little soggier than I would like and I think it's because it's so thick. The omelette was really good - not too much cheese - but needed a little salt and pepper for more flavor."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you drive by all the time, thinking \"Man, I should try that place.\" but never get around to it. Today I finally stopped by with some friends and I am SO glad I did. Matt's is a perfect early-bird breakfast stop with plenty of options for everyone. The waffles are crack and the hash browns are meth"}
{"text":"Employees with attitude. A forgotten order that was then rushed through. Food that was undercooked and unappealing. Told it would be 10 minutes. Found the absent management after 22 minutes. Pointed out to them that 22 was significantly more than 10. If you only have one machine then you probably shouldn't make promises you can't keep. Heard an employee make a rude comment about the  22 minute wait. Avoid, avoid, avoid."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an awful 13 hour lay over in Phoenix. We arrived around 8 pm and our flight wasn't until 10 am the next morning. The original plan was to eat a good dinner and try to fall asleep... Unfortunately our plan didn't work out.   We didn't get our bags until about 845 and all the restaurants were closed, so we scarfed down a pizza. Around 2 am I was searching on Yelp for some good breakfast.   I got the steak and eggs and it was cooked to perfection. Most steak and eggs are overly cooked but this steak was JUICY. My wife got a waffle with bacon. The waffle was so fluffy and had just about enough sweetness. The bacon here is also amazing. Never had bacon like this before. It was a thicker cut and seasoned with pepper. She also got a mimosa and I got a Bloody Mary. Both were really good. Thanks Matt's Big Breakfast for making this long lay over enjoyable."}
{"text":"Matt's is one of my go to breakfast spots in Phoenix. I've been coming here for about 2 years now and they never disappoint.  Nothing fancy on the menu; just basic meals made incredibly well with freshness you can taste. I'm vegetarian so I can't comment on the meat but the pancakes, waffles, omelettes and potatoes are perfect. Even their toast and jelly is amazing. AND they have real maple syrup!  Only downside is the wait time to be seated on weekends (which doesn't personally bother me, they're a great restaurant so you expect it). But, once you are seated and order, the food comes fast!"}
{"text":"Could be one of the best breakfast I have eaten outside of my kitchen.   The staff is friendly and the food came out fast and hot. I will be back in the near future.  Order the OJ is is fresh."}
{"text":"If you want a healthy hearty salad order the  healthy salad with grilled chicken. Outstanding quality. Great service. Our server had a very short haircut with pretty eyes. I did not get her name but she was so kind."}
{"text":"Finally made my way down to this place.  Was avoiding it because of the long wait everyone talks about but I had more time on my hands today so decided to give it a try.  Arrived around 12p on a Sunday and we were seated in about 45 min (party of 2- apparently, parties of 2 or 3 get seated the quickest).  Th wait wasn't so bad being that we found so shade and I had my phone to keep me occupied.  The hostess was very friendly.  The place is small.  The menu was a lot smaller than I expected.  For breakfast dishes, there were about 5-7 egg dish choices and a handful of other choices.  I opted for the griddlecakes and my husband ordered an omelette w/ cheddar, sausage and mushrooms.  He had coffee and I had the honey lemonade.  The lemonade was very refreshing, fresh squeezed and just the right sweetness.  As far as the food goes, it was good.  The sausage has a nice spice to it, the griddlecakes were light and fluffy, the strawberry jam and toast were yummy and the omelette was tasty.  My hubs ordered the hashbrowns with his dish and he prob should have gotten the home fries b/c they looked a lot better (based on the table next to us).  I give it 3 stars b/c it's just good fresh food and, for the most part, cooked well (the hashbrowns were a litte more greasy than I prefer).  I don't know if I would go through the long wait for it in the future.  Coming from San Diego (Hash House, the Mission) and LA (The Griddle), it's missing something more unique to make it worth the wait.  I've waited 60-90 min for those places.  Def give it a try if you've never been."}
{"text":"I'm  going to stop being such a taker, and give for once! I use Yelp along with other reputable websites to help make my dining, travel and shopping decisions and I never take the time to give back!! I know, I know....awful. I'm turning over a new leaf! Here is my first Yelp. Please don't judge. It's my first time.... Okay, here goes. So, I went to Matt's for the first time a few days ago....  Food- Amazing.  Best pancakes ever! I'm not sure what the secret ingredient is but they are beyond good! Fluffy little cakes of love. I also tasted the butter burger. Very, very, yummy. If you decide to dine here make sure you try the bacon. I don't think I've ever tasted anything like it. Sweet, savory and cooked just right.  The building is very small, the wait is extra long and make sure you don't overindulge on the free refills of ice tea because there is NO BATHROOM!! The seating is cramped and the service is rushed, but the food is worth dealing with Matt's shortcomings."}
{"text":"I walked 7 blocks to revisit this place rather than partake in the \"all you can eat\" breakfast at my hotel. You get lots of tasty, quality food for reasonable prices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had the Rueben w steak fries.  Great corned beef.  Paul the bartender has a great personality and seems to like his job.  Hard to find good peeps behind the bar anymore.   Especially in an airport."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast is good. Not like St. Francis good, but like the best diner food without the transients and lard that one would come to expect from traditional breakfast joints.  They mostly local and farm fresh, quality ingredients and although there isn't much variety, they do standard breakfast well.   If you want a fresh American breakfast with freshly squeezed juice, come here. Be prepared for a long wait if you snooze."}
{"text":"Well my sister and I decided to try Matt's in Tempe today and the food was good but the service well inadequate at best.  Our girl server came and took our order I had a few  questions (dietary needs and all) I ended up ordering the BLT since it was breakfast I requested the breakfast potatoes instead of chips and coffee. Well my food came with chipsI let the server (not the waitress) know I didn't order chips but the potatoes she immediate brought a side of the potatoes (great service) and I ordered sourdough but got wheat bread no biggie. We continued to eat and my coffee was running low waitress no where to be found however the server was close by \"don't know where our waitress is but can I get some more coffee please\" she immediately brought more coffee, great service!  We continued to eat our meal and talk and yet again I had to ask another person for more coffee since our waitress was no where to be found.  We where done with our meal and sat there waiting for our illusive waitress, we had to ask the very attentive waiter (very nice young man who knew his regulars) again \"we don't know where are waitress is but can we get a couple togo boxes and our check\" really!!!  I am a very good tipper I always give more than 20% however this time I did not tip a cent food was great just make sure you sit at the table where the young man will wait on you."}
{"text":"I love the waffles.......they completely blessed my hunger, took a walk, and had a nice stern talk with my appetite....this is my 2nd time eating here and I like it better this time than I did the first time."}
{"text":"Food was good! We had a large group of 25 and the service was sporadically good but could def be improved upon! I was actually surprised that refills on soda are not free. I thought it was an April fools joke but apparently not! Food elsewhere is just as good with better service and you don't have to spend $$$ on refills that cost a few pennies!"}
{"text":"\"How far is the drive from LA to Phoenix?\"   I recently caught myself contemplating this one morning in my home in LA. That is how good this place is!   Recently, on a business trip, we went for a sort of brunch/lunch. My wife had already had breakfast there that morning and insisted we return. Myself, being a skeptic, lowered my expectations so I would not burst her bubble. After my first bite of their Reuben sandwich and their hash browns I began to bubble myself! In a good way of course!   The combination of the QUALITY ingredients and the simplicity of the items made everything we ate a joy. This is a trait I have seen through most of Europe and hopefully the trend is coming here. Quality and simplicity are king!   Now the trick is to somehow get back to Phoenix. Foiled again, I knew there was a catch to this place!"}
{"text":"Matt's in the airport, love it. This was one of our favorite meals in Phoenix and now we can get a taste even when just passing through the city.   Great food for breakfast or lunch, fun music mix, and nice staff make this a go to spot, especially in an airport!"}
{"text":"This was a great way to break up an airport layover.  I had the BLT which was served on thick toasted bread and had delicious thick cut peppered bacon.  To my delight it was served with homemade kettle chips and a pickle that was pure pregnancy heaven.  I asked for another pickle and to my surprise three more were served up on a plate pro bono.  Seriously this is no Vlasic, this is some a-grade zmyology.  The kiddie meal of an egg, two pieces of the same high quality bacon, and hand-cut thick fries were a steal.  I was tempted to order a hand squeezed honey lemonade or a hand squeezed oj but I stuck with water.  They even had a high chair.  The food here is prepared with quality ingredients.  For example they make their own corned beef versus cheap-o deli meat. This ain't yo average airport fare."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast place.  Always worth the wait.  Found the place from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives show.  I'm a big fan of breakfast, but I also know what a great breakfast tastes like.  This is it.  Don't be discouraged by the wait time or the close quarters.  Belly up to the counter if you're claustrophobic.     Everything I've eaten off of the menu has been stellar.  Some reviewers said orange juice was small, but it's fresh-squeezed and delicious (unless you just brushed your teeth).  Hog and Chick, Griddle Cakes, Waffle and Bacon, all phenomenal.    Service is always excellent here.  Sometimes there were three different people waiting on our party, but we never lacked for a thing.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot in Phoenix! Check the specials first before you order. They are definitely worth a look! Jalapeño enchilada scramble was awesome"}
{"text":"I heard many people saying we should try Matt's Big Breakfast so we had to go.  This place is VERY small with very limited seating inside and no outside option when we were there.  We waited for about 45 minutes talking to people outside about how good it was.  Once seated, on the window bar stools, we were promptly greeted.  Service was good if not abrupt and to the point.  The portions were a good size, but there are bigger out there for sure.    Our food was good but nothing great as we had been hearing.  This is NOT worth the wait if you ask me, but I would go there as a neighborhood staple if no more than a 10 minute wait.   For my $ and time, I'm going to Farm House in Gilbert if I had a choice, now THAT PLACE is worth the wait."}
{"text":"A nice alternative to big box breakfast places.  We all liked our food.  We loved the strawberry preserves (bought 3 jars to take home!).  A few hints:  the bacon is pretty heavily peppered and the hash browns come as an oily brick shape.  They're good but just oily.  Our order was 100% correct, which says a lot considering the volume of orders!  One negative: only one mens and one women's restroom...between the people inside and the people waiting outside, you'd think there would be more than one for each gender.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Saw this place several years back on DDD.  I finally flew through Phoenix and went to see the place.    This is the best breakfast place I've ever been to!!!!  I am a breakfast snob if it's not better than what can do at home it's not worth paying for is my motto. Everything was awesome I mean everything.  No wonder it's gone from a tiny little place in downtown Phoenix to a three store chain."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last month with my girlfriend and it was amazing. It honestly blew away my expectations. I was mainly impressed because I really do NOT like waiting more than 10 minutes to eat somewhere, let alone breakfast. I was miffed being outside in the heat to wait, but as long as you're cool sitting at the bar, you'll get right in!   This place is WORTH THE WAIT! And do not let the limited menu fool you, everything impressed us, from the iced coffee to the Skinny plate I had and Chorizo special plate my girlfriend had. The value is also great too. I was more than full after clearing my plate. Everything was fresh, delicious, and the interior, although loud, was everything you could want from a quaint, downtown Phoenix breakfast place. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I had a kid free and lazy weekend. We got here for brunch at 10am and the place was slammed. As we didn't have anything else going on, we waited the 30 mins for a table, but they really move the crowd along so dont be too intimidated....  Well worth the wait! The freshly squeezed honey lemonade was outstanding. Menu relatively limited which was great as everything looked great. No salami scramble for me :( [next time...trying to be good] We both had the super yummy 'Skinny' which comes with a fresh and light side salad which was great, but our table neighbors hash browns looked incredibly crispy!  Even though MBB was busy with a long seating waiting list, we never felt rushed by our server. They are a very well managed eating establishment. Interior design aesthetic is fresh, fun and modern. My only personal preference, with counter seating and hightop tables options I would rather not sit at a lower table and would be willing to wait longer until either of those choices became available.  Will def. be back! Outside of the downtown Scottsdale area, Arcadia is pretty underserved for great breakfast spots so a great location for us. Parking is easy. We regularly attend swim meets at Phoenix Swim Club/Phoenix Country Day school, the close proximity means the kids can have a 'great feed' as they open at 630am or better yet, we can go there after we drop them off for warm ups!"}
{"text":"Solid Phoenix brunch spot!  We were out-of-towners visiting for the weekend, and we were hungry the minute we landed. Matt's was a highly rated brunch spot, and it definitely met my expectations. We were anticipating a potential wait on a Sat. afternoon, but there was luckily none!  I ordered the egg dish special of the day: -Egg scramble: delish, except I ended up picking out some bacon pieces  -House potatoes: made crispy and flavorful esp. with the rosemary garnish = addictive -Sourdough: perfect with their house strawberry preserve  Best part of Matt's is the hospitable service and affordable dishes. Food came out soon after we ordered and the refills and followups were continuous."}
{"text":"Matts is such a wonderful place.  My daughter & I found this gem on yelp. And it has now become our fav. We drive from Tempe to matts. The waffles r amazing and the griddlecakes....need I say more.  Try this place if you haven't."}
{"text":"Unremarkable chicken sandwich served by unenthusiastic wait staff.  Sandwich was supposed to have a pesto taste of which there was none.  Even the addition of the missing romaine lettuce would not have helped flavor wise.  Paid an outrageous $11.50 for a 5 oz. pour of Kim Crawford Sauvignon blanc.  I give it 3 stars because this is my first negative experience here."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great portion size.  The bacon is out of this world!  The weekdays aren't as busy as the weekends. Overall the food is reasonably priced and high quality.  This was our first time and we are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Worst airport food ever! Cancelled my salad because there was a roach running across the bar. I got my margarita and there was something floating in it! I wouldn't complain about the glass being dirty and just send it back but that was one to many for me"}
{"text":"Place is crazy good. Breakfast favorites that don't skimp on flavor...or saturated fats. Isn't that what breakfast is all about. If you're only going to eat out breakfast a few times a month, this is the spot.   Don't be fooled by other Phoenix Yelp haters...\"too loud\", \"not worth the price\", \"I want to love this place, but...\", same old tired reviews left at all of PHX's favorite restaurants. Check this place out, grab a coffee while you wait, and hope the Matt wants to expand the operation."}
{"text":"Arguably the best breakfast in town. High quality ingredients cooked properly."}
{"text":"Was sat quickly, table was clean and waitress was quick and friendly. I decided to order the meatloaf because the waitress said it was yummy and she was right! The meatloaf was grilled on both sides to have a crisp carmellization. The mashed potatoes were delicious with a great grace and the side asparagus was perfect! I will definitely be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place has great food, great service, great atmosphere...but a crappy wait.   I love eating at Matt's, but I don't go as frequently as I would like because of the wait. I think the food is better than most, they use fresh ingredients from the farmers market down the way, which always improves food quality.  Some people don't like the size of the restaurant, but I love it! It wouldn't be as fun and intimate if it were bigger. I have had Matt's a few times, but today I went at 6:40 (10 minutes after they open) and it was incredible. There was no line and no people, making the feel of a \"small breakfast joint\" feel real. It was calm, quiet, wonderful and reminded me to write a review! So, if you're an early bird and can get there around opening time, I highly recommend it! Otherwise, it's good, but prepared to wait while sipping on some yummy grapefruit water."}
{"text":"You have to love a place that still cares enough to use half a stick of butter when they cook your meal.  Throw in some Bourbon candied sausage and you have a real old fashioned breakfast cafe."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, I finally had my first Matt's experience this morning... I'd been hearing about Matt's Big Breakfast for ages, but never really wanted to make the drive to wait forever just for a greasy breakfast!  However, we were talked into Matt's by some friends of ours that were also Matt's virgins... we met there around 10am, only to find that there were about 2 full pages worth of names ahead of us, and that they would not quote a wait... Matt's was smaller than I imagined, so I knew it would take awhile.  We debated going elsewhere and even went over to The Turf for coffee.  (If the service there were better there, we probably would've just stayed there, but we figured if we were going to wait, we'd just wait for Matt's).  My pregnant friend went into Matt's at one point to use the bathroom and they told her she had to go to the hotel nextdoor and 'ask for Mike.'  That was a bit shady...  About an hour and a half later, our party of four was seated... and needless to say, we were all starving by then!  We started with some fresh squeezed OJ and coffee.  (The OJ glasses were tiny, but each sip tasted like heaven... and I was pleased to see that they use coffee fresh from Cave Creek Coffee Co.)  When it was time to order, I was extremely disappointed that after that long wait, they were out of whole wheat toast.  I ended up getting an egg white omelette (yes, they do egg whites), hashbrowns, sour dough toast + preserves.  I could eat only about half of it... but what I did eat was good, greasy, and filled me up for most of the day.  I don't really see myself rushing back to Matt's again anytime soon - unless it's on a weekday when the wait isn't so bad.  But I will say I'm happy that I finally made it to Matt's - and oh, what an experience it was!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Matt's Big Breakfast -- this location in particular.    The staff is super friendly, the vibe is laid back and fun, the food is pretty delicious, and the portions are indeed HUGE!  On a recent visit, I ordered the griddle cakes for the kids and a side of bacon.  Just as I finished taste-testing to make sure all was edible, I started saying that the pancakes are the best in town and my husband was saying the same thing about the bacon!  The kids enjoyed both as well...  I had \"the skinny\" which is a scramble with egg whites, spinach, gruyere cheese, and chicken apple sausage, and comes with a huge side of mixed greens...  We also had a breakfast sandwich, a hog and chick, and the Sunday Steak & Eggs special at our table... Needless to say, it was a ton of food, but those leftovers are going to be great tomorrow!  I'd love to see some fruit and maybe another healthy option on the menu, but this place still rocks... especially if you're looking to fill your belly and you're not counting calories!"}
{"text":"Our flight to Newark was scheduled to leave at 9:45am this morning.  By the time we made it through security, it was 9:20... (I'm one of those people that cuts it a little too close sometimes).  I was starving though, and knew I needed to eat something prior to the five hour flight!  Luckily, Matt's came to the rescue!  I ordered a Sonrisa Burrito to-go.  It comes with eggs, cheese, jalapeno peppers, potatoes, and your choice of bacon or sausage.  I ordered mine with sausage and no potatoes.  It was a generous serving and I actually ended up splitting it with my husband.  We devoured it and agreed that it was delicious.  I would have liked some salsa to go with it though.  Next time, I'll ask for that!  I'm now writing this review on the flight and feeling good after filling my belly... If you find yourself at Sky Harbor anywhere close to Terminal 4 - B gates, Matt's is a great option.  You can eat in or take it to-go.  So glad that we have so many decent options at the PHX airport now!  Bon appetit and safe travels!"}
{"text":"Needing my protein for supper, and my low carbs. Love that I found a place in the terminal at PHX that serves breakfast all day. The hostess, Chyrisse, was extremely helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious and they are on top of their game. I've eaten here a couple of times and each time the food was delicious and the bacon is amazing. I always liked bacon but typically, bacon is bacon but not here- this bacon is amazing! The staff is great and they work well together like a well oiled machine. You will not be disappointed if you try Mikes Big Breakfast!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Scottsdale and driving home from a doctor's visit and we discovered Matt's Big Breakfast. Great Eggs Benedict, wonderful hash browns along with fresh OJ.  What's not to like."}
{"text":"We love Matt's Big Breakfast. The food is fresh and the portions are a good size. We love breakfast food and Matt's Big Breakfast hits the spot. We are excited to return."}
{"text":"Would be a five, but only one bathroom per gender. Seriously? Everything else was great. Super efficient and great food. But figure out the potty sitch!"}
{"text":"Not a fan but the service was good. Nothing wrong with the food it's mediocre and overpriced"}
{"text":"I decided to try something different, and I'm so glad I stopped by. My wife and I both had the Saturday Special Scramble. The egg, chorizo and jalapeno peppers were cooked perfectly. Great flavor with just the right amount of heat! The coffee was good and our server was kind and thoughtful. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Charge your phone, drink your beer, and have an epic burrito.. What more could you really want? We didn't get them but the server told us how amazing the waffles are, definitely on our list for the next time we come back."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best breakfasts in the valley. From the food, to the attentive service, they never disappoint. I usually order a coffee and the special, and they are always superb! It's always fun to go to the location downtown, but it does usually have a long wait, so I prefer going to the newer location at 32nd Street and Camelback, where the wait is generally much less time."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. My one complaint is that they don't make or provide salsa. And hot sauce just isn't cutting it. But you don't need salsa for everything and I find that if you order the special of the day, you have the best experience - it's what the chef feels like making! Go on a weekday morning to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"I CANNOT believe that I have not rated this place yet... what the?!?!? I LOVE it here. Every time I have tried something different and every time I  am glad I did. This place is not only great but everyone is nice.  Ive even waited outside in the summer...that alone should say something!!"}
{"text":"We went to the location in downtown. I ordered chop and chic and my husband ordered the second daily special; the first daily special ran out just as we were ordering.  I thought my chop was a bit over cooked but it was seasoned well. The rosemary potatoes was delicious.   The second daily was eggs with apple sausage and has brown.  I thought the sausage was a bit bland.   The 'toast' that came with the entrees was deliciously fresh."}
{"text":"My husband and I made it to the Farmer's Market early on a Saturday, which is quite a feat, so we decided to reward ourselves with breakfast across the street.  We'd heard great things about Matt's and I always see a crowd of people waiting outside.   He waited for our table while I shopped across the way at the farmer's market.  While he was waiting he went inside and asked for a cup of coffee.  He was told that they only sell coffee with to-go orders, so he asked for a coffee \"to go\".  He was turned down, so he walked across the street to the farmer's market and bought some coffee from a stand.  When our table was ready, they made him stand outside to finish his coffee because they have a strict \"no outside food or drink\" rule.  Pretty lame.  As far as the food, I had an omelet with spinach, mushrooms, and fontina cheese.  My husband had an omelet with hard salami.  While the food was good, it wasn't anything I couldn't have made at home.  The star of the meal was the locally made fresh strawberry preserves, but nobody told us that was coming and it didn't go too well with my husband's sourdough toast.  A heads up would have been nice.  I think part of the allure of this place is the fact that there is almost always a crowd of people waiting outside.   There's very little chance I'll ever join them.  I'll stick to the breakfast gyros and free samples across the way at the farmer's market."}
{"text":"The place was hard to find and I would not have found it without using the navigation on my cell phone. I spent $20 on the scrambled egg special with a side of bacon and a side of hash browns. I don't mind paying good money for good food but the food was mediocre at best. After one bite of the hash browns I set them to the side and refused to try another. The bacon was delicious but a little undercooked, and the fat was still elastic. The egg special was delish. The server was prompt and manorly. The menus was small enough that I was not jumping out of my chair to try anything new."}
{"text":"I usually try and stop in when I am connecting in PHX as their food is pretty darn good. However today the service was extremely SLOW!.  They need to remember people have connecting flights and don't have a lot of time. Took 90 minutes to get in/out today, almost missed my flight. If my flight wasn't delayed I would have missed it. I had to ask for my check 3x.  So if you have less than two hours I wouldn't bother here."}
{"text":"Pro: Huge stack of beautiful pancakes. Con: Thimble of syrup, and you have to pay for more. Weak. And why do waffles include a side of bacon, but the pancakes don't? Isn't it the same batter? A steakhouse-style a la carte approach to breakfast seems like hustling backwards."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've never had a bad meal there and the staff is wonderful. The only reason I take away one star is because I really just don't like waiting outside. But the griddlecakes and sourdough toast (complete with homemade jam) are amazing!  Hopefully I will be able to visit on a day where I won't have to wait outside for too long."}
{"text":"I enjoy cooking breakfast. But sometimes I don't want to cook, I just want to eat something delicious...and simple.   There isn't much on the menu. Good food doesn't have to be complicated. My favorite breakfast here is their griddlecakes. They are like pancakes but better. Paired with their thick cut bacon (and hash browns if you're REALLY hungry) you won't be disappointed. And customer service is top-notch...EVERY time."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The customer service was awesome and the coffee was hot. Otherwise, this is a no go. Door was expensive and cold. Watched the food sit at the window for 10 minutes before it made it to us. The price to quality ratio is way off. Maybe the main location would be better."}
{"text":"This is a great spot. The people are friendly and the food is delicious. Its a small menu, I particulary enjoy the weekend specials but from my experience its all good. Expect a wait but its worth it...."}
{"text":"The potatoes are to die for and the special is always amazing.  Everything I have ever eaten here has been magnificent.  Love, love, love MBB."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to have brunch at Matts... I have been dying for a delicious homemade breakfast with an over size biscuit and bacon so crispy....you want to smack you mama.....   Well Yelpers I  found the place.... it's tucked away in strip mall were you can drive right passed it ....   We had a short wait (15 mins) which I heard it great for any place that services brunch on a busy Sunday. We were seated my a man who could have been an actor or an actor type....lol....  I immediately ordered a cup of coffee...now we know most places which have a diner feel have the worse coffee...... WELL BLOW ME AWAY....this coffee was so damn good...I have two refills before I actually ordered breakfast....   I ordered scrambled egg whites, home fries with toast and of course BACON......   We waited patiently for our meal and then from the corner of my eye.... I see it.... pure bliss....  The plate looked like a work of art..... my mouth began to water and eyes were tearing...   I couldnt even wait until the cute waitress placed my plate down in from of me. I grabbed the first thing on the plate and by the grace of everything  holy...... it was the BACON..... lite, crispy with freshed cracked pepper on it....   Everything was seasoned well and tasted delicious...the home fries with rosemary and carmalized  onions....Wowwwww!  Look I already have a another day planned for breakfast this week.... I know I may need rehab... I would have given Matts 5 stars but they only serve biscuits on Tuesday's......bummer!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch during the week, and were not disappointed! Great spot for brunch!  It's just street parking around the restaurant, and I can imagine that when this place is busy, parking might be kind of difficult.   Inside it's wide open seating with a small counter/bar seating area as well. It's pretty noisy/loud inside, but not to the point where it bothered us. The service was excellent! Very fast! Very friendly!  The food was also excellent! We had the Skinny and the Special (egg scramble w/ schreiner's chorizo, jalapeno's, white cheddar, potatoes). Both were delicious, and were only $10.95 with good size portions! We also had the signature bourbon cherry sausage, which was a really interesting mix of flavors, and had a nice crunch to the casing. We definitely left very full!  Overall, great brunch spot in Phoenix! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"no place i would rather be on a Saturday at 6:30 a.m.  then at Matt's Big Breakfast -definately we worth getting up early for with a small group of great friends - the best breakfast joint in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, I admit it - we are waaaaay late to this party. We tried once before but the hour-plus wait was just two much for the four starving carnivores with me that day. This time our strategy was to go early on a Saturday morning as close to 6:30am opening as possible. We arrived around 7:15 (it WAS the weekend after all) and only waited about 20min for a table for two.   I had the special of the day - 3-egg scramble with andouille sausage, fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese - YUM! The sausage had just the right enough of bam and the home fries with rosemary and onions rocked. My companion had the hog and chick - awesome meaty bacon with that.  Great value for the price - I packed up at least half my meal for the starving teenagers at home (who could not be roused at dawn). If you haven't been, get up early, bring a newspaper and rest assured Matt's Big is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Came here today with friends that were visiting from San Diego. The wait for a table was about 45 minutes when we went. They have nice seating out front and they also supply fruit infused water with little paper cups while you wait. The 45 minutes went by quickly and we were seated at a table in the back by the daily specials wall. For drinks, ordered the strawberry honey lemonade and that was amazing! The drink was refreshing and not too sweet with great strawberry flavor. I could seriously drink these all day long. For breakfast, I ordered the waffles which came with thick bacon. The bacon was thick cut and was cooked perfectly for me.. nice crunch but not burnt. The bacon seemed to be peppered whatever the seasoning the taste was good. The waffles had a good flavor to them but I wished my waffle had a nice and crisp outside with the fluffy inside. The entire waffle was soft which made me a little sad but it still tasted good. I tried some of my friend's hash browns and that was delicious! They were clearly browned in butter and had a really nice buttery taste to them and they were perfectly textured. Great crispy outside. I also tried another friend's home fries and those were delicious as well. They had a very distinct buttery rosemary taste. Another tasty item I sampled was the strawberry jam that came with the toast. It wasn't too sweet at all and had a creamy texture to it. I wish that I had that option for my waffles instead of the syrup because I don't like syrup and the jam was scrumptious.   The staff was really friendly and attentive. My boyfriend's coffee was never empty. They would continuously refill without us having to ask. They were super busy and still had great service!"}
{"text":"Good service every time.  Paul is great bartender!  Amazing bacon Bloody Mary .  See you guys next time."}
{"text":"Breakfast food is my favorite and Matts Big Breakfast is THE BEST in Phoenix!! They use quality food that tastes amazing!!! I always get the bacon, scrambled eggs, and potatoes. The toast and fresh made preserves are out of this world you have to get a jar to take home!!!! You won't be disappointed with anything you try I promise!!"}
{"text":"Great food but wait times can be long, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for breakfast!!!  The waffle literally melts in your mouth.  I have been going to Matt's for over 10 years now and have recommended it to hundreds.  The owners and staff are amazing.  The ingredients are fresh and I have yet to have a dish I did not like.  I would come early as it is very busy, but worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"A delightful eating experience. Chicken apple sausage was tasty and cooked to perfection.  Waffles with crispy/buttery edges... Delish! I would highly recommend this breakfast spot"}
{"text":"It was about a 15 minute wait ; the weather was okay but the food was amazing . There bread & fresh jam is everything . Definitely a go to breakfast spot if your in Phoenix ."}
{"text":"In downtown Phoenix for work, wanted to get a good breakfast. This place was just fantastic! Good portions, fresh ingredients, and great service. If I'm ever back in Phoenix again I would absolutely come here for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and if you hit it at the right day/time, no waiting. Unfortunately 4 stars for the ultra skimpy/tight shorts that some of the wait staff were wearing. I'm no prude but come on girls, this ain't Hooters!"}
{"text":"IMO this is currently my favorite breakfast place in Phoenix. The menu is pretty basic and straight forward but everything I've had so far is absolutely delicious. Even just a cheese omelet and hash browns with toast is incredible! The decor is very cute and it's a seat yourself kind of place."}
{"text":"After waiting outside for a table we got one close to the bathrooms and it was heinous. The large orange juice should have more water than orange. The ambiance is pretty busy so the waitress. Hence, it is a whole mess without mention that the bill arrives just on time to kick us out and welcoming the new victim. The food was ... Oh yes it was as bad as the service. Probably it wasn't my day and not even the sort of place I will repeat. PD: I am not a bacon person.... If you are not a bacon person don't waist your time.. If you are... Check other reviews !"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Guess I should've read reviews ahead of time and stuck with waffles, pancakes, or homestyle fries.  Place was busy...no one at hostess stand to take names, leaving everyone crowded and confused. He finally hurried over and kicked us all outside to wait in the cold because we \"couldn't be blocking the door\". Finally got seated on the barstools (annoying).  We all got omelets and hashbrowns. I got the \"special\" with polish sausage and peppers. It sounded better than it was. Omelet was runny, hate that. And just unimpressive.  Only good thing about the meal was the thick toast...but really....its toast. There's nothing \"big\" about the portion either, so I don't know about the \"big breakfast\" thing. Everyones plates in the place looked unappetizing and boring, honestly. Worst breakfast I've ever spent money on."}
{"text":"01/26/2014- broke down when a memory of a once delicious waffle came to mind and returned after I swore I wouldn't. Why can't I just listen to myself? Took 1 hour to get seated, brought out a burned waffle, screwed up my husband's order, let our coffee cups go empty (never 1 refill) then 5 different people asked us 8 times if we were all finished, would like anything else, can I take that check even though I just brought your plate, aka GET THE HELL OUT. Ok, this is my last mistake. Matts Big Breakfast I'm gone peace out used to love you but you wrecked our relationship with your dumb hipster waiters"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Better than most other airport food place. I had cheese omelet w all the add ons. Makes it a $13.99 omelette but was pretty good. Onions were a little mushy but not bad. I would recommend this place. Almost worth 5 stars"}
{"text":"I showed up this month for the Yelp breakfast club.  To me this is a really good neighborhood breakfast/lunch place.  Not necessarily a destination place nor worth the wait outside.  The food is good and priced correctly.  The space is still cramped for parties of 5 or more"}
{"text":"Hey, Matt's with parking! Matt's always does a solid job with their meals and service. A destination place? Probably not. My friend and I picked it because it was a known place about halfway between us for an early morning breakfast."}
{"text":"Holy cow! Matt's knows how to cook potatoes. Whether you order them as home fries or hash browns, you cannot go wrong with either option. In fact, I would recommend building some sort of combination of both style of potatoes with a side of toast + strawberry jam because those are probably the best items on the menu.   I ordered the Hog and the Chick, and the pork chop lacked seasoning. My friend wasn't particularly fond of it either.   I do recommend ordering the strawberry honey lemonade. It's a little on the sweet side, but still highly satisfactory.  I am still day dreaming about those potatoes and wish I had placed an additional order to go."}
{"text":"Matt my friend,you never disappoint!   I chose to meet here for a business breakfast and was very happy with my choice. The goal: local, character, solid meal, easy parking  and central location. Mission accomplished.   Had the daily special with home fries - my MO is to trust the daily special and I'm always happy. Always love the coffee - though I would love to see some fresh cream from a local farm as an option."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.. the wait was a lil long but all in all some good food..  the bacon reminded me of the pepper bacon at stater bros"}
{"text":"Look, there is no reason for you to read the 51st review on this place unless you specifically sought me out and you trust me.  Matt's is good!  Go stuff yo face in a waffle and that thick cut bacon.  Mmm!"}
{"text":"Good hearty breakfast accompanied by superior service. Omelet delish and hash browns crispy.  Nice jam with the toast. Very good service and attentiveness. Thank you all beautiful. Will return."}
{"text":"So here is a crazy, slightly relevant way to describe Matt's Big Breakfast.  Matt's is one of the places you are almost obliged to like, because if you don't, you look like a total, unsophisticated schmuck.  No one talks shit about this Phoenix icon!  To speak one bad word of Matt's is like cursing the Virgin Mary.  But here is the thing, all the genuine, honest compliments you can heap onto Matt's is well deserved.  It's like the cool kid in school is well liked for legitimate reasons, not just because he/she is popular.    Meal: The fiancé does a great job of always getting something new here.  Typically its a vegetarian omelet.  I typically get the slinger (shhhssssshhhh, secrete menu item!) and whatever special lemonade is available.  Taste:  Every bite is pure heaven.  The homemade jams are special and remind me of home in the midwest.  The ingredients are fresh.  The homemade bread is spectacular.  The meals are amazing.  I feel like its a safe bet in saying that Matt's is the best place to get breakfast in Phoenix.  10 out of 10.  Value:  You aren't going to get a steal here, but then again, this isn't Home Country Buffet.  The portions are above equivalent to Denny's and the prices are about the same.  Because of the great taste and freshness, the value is above average.  4 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  This place is busy.  There are always lines, but they are efficient and quick.  The waiters and waitresses are always pleasant.  The are knowledgeable and the seem genuinely excited about the food they serve.  They sometimes lack attentiveness, but it doesn't come off as being inept.  8 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  Matt's fits the the downtown scene.  And Matt's is the type of place where the things on the wall don't distract from the food.  The crowd is very diverse and the dining area is kind of loud, but kind of perfect.  5 out of 5.  Overall:  If heart disease didn't run in my family, I would eat here way more often.  Believe the hype, Matt's is the place to be! 27 out of 30 points, 5 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"It was the 6th month anniversary for The Breakfast Club UYE (woot woot) and the placed picked to try was Matt's Big Breakfast.  I picked this place because I had heard they do take reservations of a large groups and thought how sweet is that, I called them and verified that they do, then told them I would call back with the final details.  When I got all the information, called them back and told them what day & time and how many, and was told then that the reservations is actually for groups of 5 or smaller :( whomp whomp , but was told that they could hold a party of 15 we just needed to get on the list, and then she asked what is the meaning for the reservations, and I said we are monthly breakfast club and we picked Matt's to try this month, I was then told that Matt's turns tables over fast is it's not really the type of place to hold meetings, I laughed and said the type of meetings we are doing is eating.    Got there around 8am on Sat morning, put my name on the list for a party of 15, I was then told that the entire party needs to be there in ordered to be seated, I told her that I would need to be saving one seat, someone is running late, I was told only way to save a seat is to order their food for them that way all orders are going in at the same time.  Just stating this on the review to give people with groups the heads up. Everyone showed up, and we were seated pretty quickly!  When I figured out that we were headed to Matt's Big Breakfast, what I wanted to order, had to have, needed to taste was there waffles, when I got into Matt's and seated at the table I looked up and saw the daily special and said, oh that's what I'm having.  It was three eggs scrambled with Schriener's chorizo fresh jalapeños cheddar cheese and home fries and flour tortilla. This dish was delish!! The jalapenos where so fresh!! The home fries were perfectly cooked; the eggs & chorizo were very good stuffed in that flour tortilla! Only thing that could have made this better was some great hot sauce! The dish for me was lacking in heat, but was great in flavor!   I did see a waffle or 2 at the table, and let me tell you, they looked great, but I think I made the right choice, see I like to have some waffle of pancake with my syrup and at Matt's you get 2 ounces of real maple syrup, additional 2 ounces can be bought for a buck 50, so if it was me, I would be spending like 5 bucks just on syrup.   Wonder if I can bring in my own haha  I have wanted to try Matt's Big Breakfast for a very long time now and am very happy I did, everything is fresh and fast! I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for breakfast at any time of the day, look no further. You will be filled up and be leaving satisfied as the portions are indeed as the name indicates: BIG. The quality of the food was perfect. Absolutely no issues and everything was cooked to order.   The service was AMAZING. If you have a chance, ask for Emily \"Monster.\" She was the most hospitable waitress and had everything to the table promptly and had a smile on her face the entire time.  You absolutely should eat here if you're at the airport and looking for a quality meal."}
{"text":"A small but busy diner/breakfast joint. Fair prices for what you get. Food is good, we had the skinny, waffles and the special (3 egg omelette) and a side of hashbrowns.   Waffles were dense, syrup was real maple and bacon was smokey. The Skinny salad was great but I thought the chicken apple sausages were a bit too sweet. Salad on the other hand pretty good. Hashbrowns tasted like real potatoes... Which I don't get very often. The special was good, the preserve served with the bread was quite delicious. We did find it a bit peculiar that it seems AZ eggs are smaller than CA eggs ... Not sure why.   Overall good quality food, perfect portion (not too much and not stingy) and fair prices. We waited half an hour and thought we made the right decision. If the wait was about 1hr+, then we would have said not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Airport restaurants and bars are almost always going to be lesser than their counterparts. You're naturally going to get bottom of the barrel employees. Ones that can't get the same job outside of the airport.   But, this place is especially bad. I'm an okay cook. Maybe pretty good. But not great. I could make better food than this place all day. It's terrible. If you need to eat a meal, it will do the job. But that's it. For example, the burger is really just pathetic. It's a very low quality ground meat. I mean something you wouldn't even see available at the grocery store. The bun overwhelms the meat because the burger itself cooks to a withering lump. Everything they put on the side to load the burger is equally unsatisfying. Nobody cares about the price in an airport. You have a captive group of buyers. Make good food.   Service is sub par but nothing unusual for an airport. Just your typical waiting too long for everything even though you're obviously waiting to catch a flight. When I'm flashing my credit card though, let's get the transaction done. Don't walk away telling me my receipt is in the cup next to me. When is the last time somebody looked at a receipt in a restaurant. Just pay me out."}
{"text":"Came here this past Saturday (9/24/16) after an early morning hike at CamelBack Mtn.  It was our first time here, and decided to go with their Breakfast special - 3 eggs with bacon and jalapeno, hashbrown, and tortilla.  They use thick-cut bacon (my favorite!) The tortilla really complimented the eggs and added a nice touch. Overall, a good experience.  Didn't really see anything too special, but will come back again."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon, the wait was 45 mins for 4 people. We waited because everyone keeps talking about it. Man, was I starving to death when we were seated. I had the ham and cheese omelet and everyone shared an order of waffle with everyone else. The omelet was good. The waffles were light and fluffy. Good but not to die for. I personally think it was over hyped. It is good breakfast food, not GREAT."}
{"text":"We went to the original location years ago and it was amazing!  The wait was crazy though since it's such a small place but it was worth the wait.  The food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Always worth the wait. Their food is consistently delicious and the staff is fun and friendly.   I highly recommend ordering the bacon- it is the best bacon I've ever had- thick and crispy.   Love it!"}
{"text":"Seriously, Matt's cooks up some of the best breakfast food I have ever had. I've been going here for three years or so, and I have never been disappointed. I've never waited much more than 30 minutes, but that's probably because I never go on weekends after 8:30 AM and never at lunch time on weekdays.   Their eggs benedict is hands down the best I have ever had. It's a special, so you have to be lucky to get it. Before I ever had their eggs benedict (the first was actually a sausage benedict with their AMAZING sausage), i had never really been a fan. But their benedict sparked such a deep love that whenever I've been in a restaurant that serves benedict, I always get it, but it never measures up. Their fresh hollandaise, perfectly poached egg, delicious ham and wonderful english muffin... just cannot be beat. And then you have their oh-so-buttery hash browns that I crave on a regular basis. I used to have a problem deciding between their also awesome homefries roasted perfectly with rosemary, but now I can't resist the hash browns. Also, their bacon is absolutely heavenly, and I'm not really a huge fan of bacon, so I always end up ordering a side of it. The omelets and pancakes are also always perfectly fluffy and delicious, and I've never found their portions to be remotely small. I always leave completely fat and happy. My only complaint that I can think of is that their delicious orange juice comes in an insanely small portion, but their delicious honey lemonade makes up for it.  This is always on my list of restaurants I absolutely have to go to when I'm home from college."}
{"text":"Loved the food, best breakfast I've had the portion is huge and priced very well. I was full for most of the day after eating here. I would definitely go back food was on point I had the waffle plate it was sooooo  good! Excellent choice!"}
{"text":"This is more than just great food.  It's traditional breakfast fare, creatively prepared  and served by friendly and attentive staff.  I went for opening bell, which is a bit early for most, but no line up.  This is the kind of place you'd want to go back until you've had everything on the menu, except they also have daily specials, so you'll just have to keep coming."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix, and I love the location. I always the waffle, with the amazing bacon. There coffee is surprisingly good as well. Whenever my wife and I try to \"find\" a new spot for breakfast in Phoenix, we always just end up at Matt's. It is that good.  Also I work at a restaurant down the road, and we get a lot of travelers. Anytime I recommend them going to Matt's they always come back saying it was a great experience. I am glad that there is a place that I have enough confidence that no one will leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"I like to go too restaurants that have four or more stars. I usually get a good meal and enjoy the visit. This was not the case at Matt's. The way this place is run is outside the normal. We had a seat at the counter and our order was taken by a waitress not the person behind the counter. When orders would come up at the window, it was very obvious that the person behind the counter had no idea who the order belonged too. This resulted in plates set in front of the wrong customers. We watch my wife's order set for five or more minutes till it arrived. My order set for a couple minutes until the person behind the counter had to ask the waitress who it belonged to. As expected the meals were cold. Not only that but the food was three to four stars at the best. Coffee was cold and we made a comment to the person behind the counter. She was able to make fresh pots but again with a delay. A place with this good of a rating should be able to handle a full house but it didn't. Service was poor but friendly until you got to the cashier. And that is a story for another day but not another visit. Oh my wife's toast was given to person down the counter."}
{"text":"Stay away from the Cobb Salad. Mine was soggy as if the ingredients had all been mixed together and then everything was refrigerated. The dressing doesn't compliment the salad very well either."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in the greater Phoenix area! The problem with most places that have high reviews is that they don't live up to the hype and your expectations are too high. That being said, I went to Matt's with high expectations and they exceeded them. I think a lot of breakfast is bland and similar to other places, but not Matt's.   Sure, it's busy all the time...that's because it's good. Sure, it's loud...that's because it's busy. Service is good. I love sitting at the breakfast bar because the service is even better.   My favorite dish is the salami scramble with added jalapenos. Waffle is the best I've tasted. Hash browns are up there with the best i've tasted. Hell, even their jelly is better. I've been here about 10 times and never left dissatisfied. Only tip would be to get there early. After about 8:30 it really starts to pick up, at least on the weekends."}
{"text":"After waiting outside in the rain for over an hour to get in, we finally got one of the only ten tables (if even that) in this place.    I do have to say that everything was fresh and everything tasted great... But... it's breakfast.  I know that big chains can somehow screw it up, but for the most part, it's not that difficult to pull off.   This is one of the better places I've had breakfast... Maybe it was the hype, maybe the wait in the cold rain, or maybe it was just the food.    Was it worth waiting in the rain for an hour?  No.  Was it worth waiting an hour without the rain?  No.  Was it some tasty breakfast?  Yes."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite breakfast place in Phoenix. Their food just tastes like food should! There's a reason that there are always lines of people waiting to get inside; it's just THAT GOOD."}
{"text":"YUMMMMMM!!  Had the days special scramble: sausage w peppers w hashbrowns; just perfect w a crispy crust & perfect inside not mushy. BF had Chick n Chop. I'm not a fan of pork chops but thaws were flavorful, tender and just super yum!  My only gripe is that I ordered fresh, i got a bout 6oz,  for $2.75 yikes!!! Caution it can get crowded and its a pretty small location. But I think it was good, luckily we only waited 15 min but locals say sometimes it can be pretty long"}
{"text":"This is to-die-for foodie experience.  Every taste bud in your mouth is entertained by the bountiful food flavors.  The staff is friendly and efficient. The fresh squeezed orange juice is incredible.   Go there hungry. Leave there completely satisfied.   This writer will be a frequent visitor,...YUM!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the huevos rancheros for brunch! I thought the potatoes were really good and seasoned. I went on a Monday morning so didn't have to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"I feel like a douche bag for giving Matt's only 1 stars when everyone else raves about this place and the owner truly is such a delight so in my defense let me explain: This place is a hot spot, every time I've tried to go there, it's packed.  Each time, I've never wanted to wait so I went on my way. One Sunday, I was just down the street from them at Valley Youth Theatre watching Winnie the Pooh with my son and I thought how great it would be to take my son to this popular joint for a bit of breakfast afterward.  When we got out of the theatre, it was pouring rain in giant buckets, one of those rarities in Phoenix where you can't see what's in front of you cause it's raining so hard.  Well, we braved the rain and drove to Matt's~ 5 mins. after their posted closing time and yup, you guess it~ despite me and my 3 1/2 year old son drenched wet and  looking pleadingly at them for some warm food and a place to stay for awhile to get out of the rain, they told us they were closed and sent us on our way.  Talk about tough standards~ I guess when you are as popular as Matt's you get to make and stick by the rules you make. Despite that experience, I still wanted to try Matt's because of all the applaudes I've heard about the place. Finally I made it there on one of those days when I had the time for the long wait and sadly for me, I was sorely disappointed by the breakfast served to me. I had remembered reading some article about the BIG BREAKFAST served at Matt's and that's what I was expecting.  I ordered the waffle with bacon for $9 expecting a Denny's portion of food but with flavor and excellence.  The place was packed so I had to wait 30mins for my waffle to materialize in front of me.  When I got the one piece of waffle and one piece of bacon served to me, I thought perhaps while waiting I had accidentally swallowed Alice (in Wonderland) tonic and was now a giant looking at my rather small serving of food on my plate.  Seriously, I almost felt tears come into my eyes, I was so disappointed.  Needless to say, after trying so many times to go to Matt's and finally getting there just to have not a big breakfast but a are you kidding me?  where's the rest of my food experience, I will not go back there.  It's a good thing too cause it's far from my house and I hate waiting!"}
{"text":"I'm sure it's excellent -- but after waiting on line for 30 minutes on a Saturday morning, we sat down and realized that their menu is pretty small, and almost all dishes contain some sort of pork. That narrowed our choice to pretty much pancakes (just say \"killing me softly with your buttah..\"), so we bolted -- to Palatte.   I'm sure it's great if you like good ol' home cookin' diner food, but for this New York food snob, the choices are too few to wield my wallet."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim because we heard so many good things about this restaurant. They are open until 2:30PM each day and serve mainly breakfast (although they do have some lunch items). I had the eggs Benedict which was good but not great. My husband has the 5 points breakfast sandwich - again, good but not great. What was great; the service and the rosemary breakfast potatoes (if you like rosemary - these are a MUST)."}
{"text":"What a great place. Fort of all I have to say you will never wait to be helped or served once you get a seat. All the wait staff work together to make sure no one goes for more than a few minutes without being helped. What a great concept. They do not have a huge various crazy selection of food options, which at first seems limiting but when you realize that what they do have and serve is done right, fresh and full of fresh local flavors. A++ to the all the people who make this a great breakfast spot!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast place! Fresh and simple ingredients on the plate that was great tasting! No GF exchange available. Was able to get a slice of tomato instead of toast. GF option would have been a 5 star rating. Reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"I was starving after my breakfast meeting this morning so I stopped in at Matt's since I am not usually on this side of town. Service was great and the breakfast potatoes with rosemary and onions were yummy. I also love the homemade preserves with the toast.  The nicest part was I was writing a letter to my son on the back of the paper placemat and the server was so sweet to offer me another placemat to finish my letter. He even made sure I didn't forget the letter when I left."}
{"text":"They'd rather ignore you than deal with you. Don't go in anywhere close to last call. Rude bartender. Our waitress was nice- her name was Katrina I think? But the lack of communication got in the way of her doing her job.  I had a \"please just let me give you my money\" smile on my face, but nobody would make eye contact. Bummer.  And dear host- if it's that close to last call, don't encourage people to go in and give it a try... It's embarrassing for me as I sit and wait, and embarrassing for you when I walk out disappointed. My advice- just be nice and be honest!"}
{"text":"Mom and I stopped in for breakfast on a Tuesday morning and the place was packed (which is a good sign!). We only waited a few minutes before being seated at the counter (which we were glad as the dining room was packed and noisy). The food was great (had the cheese omelet with mushrooms-excellent!) However the exception was the home fries, which came in a large block, were greasy and tasted like they were previously frozen. Other than that, the service was great, coffee was good and they kept the refills coming. I'll def be back but will choose the homestyle potatoes instead."}
{"text":"This was a great discovery. Breakfast anytime. The 5 step breakfast sandwich was awesome and the happily kept the request for no onions off with a smile. The chili burger was a real life medium like I ordered. I am impressed with any plane that does this let alone a place in the airport."}
{"text":"This cute little breakfast/lunch establishment is always bustlin', though I got lucky at a 9 am time slot on Monday morning with no wait!   Location/parking: This is downtown Phoenix, so there's some street parking and meters near by.  I live close enough to walk.  If you're waiting, you will likely wait outside.   Variety: Not a huge menu but typical breakfast offerings of eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, and breakfast sandwich. There's an option with egg whites and vegetables.   Food:  I ordered the cheese omelet with potatoes and toast.  The omelet was perfect and cooked just right - a basic cheese omelet with my choice of cheese.  The potatoes were delicious, but some were not cooked at all. They were flavored with rosemary. There are various options for toast; I chose sourdough. They brought it with delicious jam.   Service: Efficient and quick.  Most everyone was friendly.   Ambiance/noise level: It's going to be busy likely, and it's cramped, so it's not super quiet but I could still hear everything.   All in all, a good experience!"}
{"text":"The menu is limited but it's because everything they do they do great. Hands down one of the best waffles I've ever had - just the right amount of crispness - and the bacon is always cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Absolutely AWESOME!!!  Best breakfast ever actually recommended to us by a homeless man who said they have fed him from time to time even let him work for food a few times.  These are great people serving AMAZING food!  BTW the one in the PHX airport has the most AMAZING Bloody Mary...must try!!!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Matt's EARLY one Sunday morning with the family.  Luckily they arrived well before I did and I didn't have to wait very long.  The place is small, like previous posters have alluded too.  You don't get how small until you actually go.  10 tables and 7 seats at the counter, tops.  The waits can be long and now I know why.  So we were a party of 8.  The parents sat at a table and the \"kids\" sat at the counter.  The menu is simple with not a lot to choose from.  I heard the pancakes were great, but I like a little more substance with my breakfast.  I chose the special, 3 egg scramble with bacon, cheddar, and fresh jalapenos, rosemary home fries and a tortilla.  Not being a huge jalapeno fan I almost had them nixed from the order, but decided to go with it.  Glad I did.  It was great and the peppers added a nice little bit of heat.  The rosemary home fries were outstanding!  I know all of this sounds very simple and you could probably make this at home, but it always tastes so much better when someone else makes it!    I think this place is worth the hype!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Great service, food and prices!  Excellent quality and quantity.  Fresh squeezed OJ was very good and so was the home made toast and jam."}
{"text":"Thumbs Up!  I vouch Matt's Hog & Chick is worth the long wait!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait, best waffle I've ever had in my life. You only get one waffle, but it's flavor is caramelly and rich, topped with sweet cream butter and authentic maple syrup.  It also comes with two delicious slices of thick cut bacon.  If you come here be prepared to wait a while for a table, but it really is worth it."}
{"text":"So today I decided to take my wife and daughter out for breakfast being Valentine's day. I've been to the downtown location and  never had a problem. We decided to try the biltmore location this time and was very  disappointed in there service. The wait time is usually  a bit long but we knew we were going to wait especially being Valentine's, surprisingly we only waiting 45min to be seated. We have waited longer at other times we gone. But from the time we sat down took like 10min to get someone to help us then the part that got my wife  and me more upset is that we had put our order for the food and it' took 45min to get our food. People that were outside waiting were seated and got there food first than us and we asked this waiter if he could check on our food because we been waiting for awhile. HE  went to the back and never heard from him again finally 10min later we got our food. And we never got our receipt either we usually get it half way through our meal. So we had to walk up to the front and ask for it. Was the worse experience at this food chain the food was great but the service was horendous."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last weekend. I was so amped to eat there because I had seen many reviews of the restaurant on Triple D and other such shows. I ordered the Hog and Chick, which is 2 eggs, potatoes, breakfast meat and toast. Eggs were cooked as ordered. Sausage links were the maple-rosemary variety, which I found to be unpleasantly sweet and over-seasoned. The home-fries were overcooked and not crispy. Toast consisted of home-made style bread, which is about 1.5 inches thick. Best part was the strawberry jam. And the iced water. It was hot!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here today - Let's just say there's a reason it's called Matt's \"BIG\" Breakfast. Had the scramble special. It was full of flavor, cheesy (like me) and filling.   Oh... and the never-ending coffee gave me LIFE!!!   We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The wait was a bit long but definetly worth it! On a sunday morning at 830 the wait was just under 15 mins for two. Once seated at the bar area the menus were provided...very simple one page menu but dont be put off - the items they make they make very well and in generous portions. We both ordered the chic and hog with ham (dollar extra but worth it). The hashbrowns were a bit undercooked but still delicious...the home fries came with sauteed onions. The toast is awesome...very thick slices and comes with jam and butter! The coffee was nice and strong - much appreciated on this sunday morning with bottomless refills. Overall an amazing find...very affordable as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good. You will have a long wait, but it is good. If you're willing to sit at the bar your wait will be shorter. I would recommend getting there close to opening if you'd like to be seated right away."}
{"text":"Visited the establishment twice.  Both times on a weekend.  Parking was difficult but expected since it is located downtown.  Breakfast was good but not great.  Expected amazing so I was left somewhat dissatisfied.  Service was just OK.  Will try again and update if my mind has been changed."}
{"text":"After the we arrived from the Phoenix airport we arrived here due to the good reviews on Yelp. The food was good not breath taking. House potatoes were a bit overwhelming with spices (Rosemary I believe) and had to drench with tapatio for different flavor. Eggs, bacon, sausage link and waffle were great.  RC cola was there soft drink choice, which was pretty cool to me because you hardy ever see that."}
{"text":"Honestly, I wait in line for the bacon.  Matt's bacon is not for everyone, that's for sure. Vegetarians, look away! 'cause this stuff is fatty, medium-rare, meat candy! The pepper sounded off-putting to me until I tasted it, and oh, how I enjoy it. Been there many times and whenever my Foodie brother is in town, he takes me there so he can get 2 or 3 orders of bacon. Great on the side of their Griddlecakes, which taste like a combination of a corn muffin and a pancake. De-lish. Worth the wait. Oh, and remember: this is a Divey Diner in an undesirable section of Downtown Phoenix--so SNOBS BEWARE! The rest of us will continue to enjoy the homemade goodness."}
{"text":"Matt's is my go to breakfast spot in AZ! I always get the hog and Chick! I definitely recommend them as the best spot in AZ"}
{"text":"I like Matt's.  I understand some of the criticisms but I also understand the raves.  Pros:  -The food IS good. Some of the items are breakfast basics, sure, but the pancakes are anything but ordinary.  They're almost perfect.   The home fries are great - rosemary goodness. There's also a great menu selection - a nice mix of breakfast standards with unique and special twists. -The atmosphere.  Yeah it's small, but it's part of the charm.  Con: -It's expensive.  There's no way around it. - It IS small.  You will have to wait, sometimes for a long time."}
{"text":"When I'm looking for a breakfast that reminds me of what my grandmas would make.  I love their food. The cheese omelette is solid. I've also had the salami scramble, which is really good. The oatmeal is good if you're looking for a healthy option.  I think what makes Matt's stand out from other breakfast joints is their ingredients.  They make their jam from scratch, which is a nice touch. The thick-cut  If there's one complaint, it's the home fries.  Not a big fan of the rosemary seasoning for breakfast -- just a personal preference."}
{"text":"We are a big fan of Matt's Big Breakfast Downtown. Food is amazing, even though the wait is frustrated sometimes. I love their 3 eggs scramble special. Also the waffle is delightful. When they opened new one in Camelback location, we were so excited since its much closed to where we live. Even though same owner and menu, the food is not quite the same. May be just my taste. Anyway,  Matt's Big Breakfast is still one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix metro!"}
{"text":"I've made this mistake twice. First time, it was a rude waiter that rubbed me the wrong way. Second time...25 minutes for an order of oatmeal. The take away counter is chaos. The person working there cannot both take orders and serve food. There's too many people. Chaotic."}
{"text":"Service was fast and good, but that's about it. The chicken Cobb salad was lack luster. The chicken was not fresh. Same with the bacon in the breakfast options. Nothing felt fresh, but all of it was greasy, even the salad! Skip this place."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Sheraton downtown and Matt's was a short walk.  Definitely worth the walk, and it helped to justify eating such a large breakfast.  There is probably something there that is not very good, but we did not find it.  When you get there, make sure you check in with the person running the register"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot and the ONLY reason I enjoy not having a direct flight with a layover at PHX airport is this place! They have such healthy and delicious options. Everything is so fresh! Can't wait until my next layover to eat here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, humanely raised eggs and bacon, real maple syrup, homemade bread, good coffee, and super fast delivery of our food to the table. What more could you want? Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. The owner is very down to earth. The pancakes are amazing and so is the steel cut oats. I always get a bunch of items and eat a little of each. Now this place is in the 4th terminal in the airport and  I am thrilled. Going to this restaurant back in the day and waiting sometimes 2 hours just to eat in a small restaurant with on small air conditioner....now they have expanded and have several but I am telling you that is how good their food is!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. I honestly was not impressed with the lunch menu & food. I had the cobb salad and I was disappointed. The lettuce was old and wilted. I'm sure their breakfasts are a lot better (since that's what they are known for.) The service, however, was fantastic. The lady was so nice and made up for the not so great salad!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst breakfast experiences we have ever had at a restaurant.  There were so many issues that it's hard to know where to begin.  I guess it all started with a dirty water cup.  Hubby ordered water and I got freshly squeezed OJ.  The water cup had food residue all over it and there was also something floating in the water.  As we were waiting for our food for over 30 minutes, we observed servers giving food to the wrong people on multiple occasions.  We know that we were waiting for our food for over 30 minutes, because I checked in on Yelp right after we ordered so we had a time stamp as a reference.  We also observed the manager scold a server in the middle of the dining room.  The server was visibly mad at him.  When our food came out, the server gave it to the people next to us while we were trying to tell him that it was ours.  It was very obvious that servers did not know table numbers because so many people were given the wrong food.   Hubby and I both ordered the scramble special with Havarti cheese, sausage and spinach.  When we got the food, the eggs were severely overcooked.  There was no cheese in mine nor my husband's scramble.  The potatoes, which I took some photos of, were so charred that it looked like there were chunks of coal in them.  My husband sent his plate back because it was so bad.  When the manager brought out the newly cooked plate of food for him, he tossed it down in front of my husband and said \"Here ya go, dude.\"  NO apology, no nothing.   I have never seen such apathy from a restaurant manager before.    The kitchen was obviously in the weeds the entire time we were there.  There seems to be a huge training issue that spans from the kitchen to management, to the servers.  I think this location has bitten off much more than they can chew.  It's giving MBB a bad reputation.  I have written hundereds of reviews, and I very rarely give a one star review.  MBB earned that one star."}
{"text":"I'm in agreement with the masses about Matt's Big Breakfast.  It's super tasty!!  I have brought two groups of out of towners to Matt's when they've landed super early at Sky Harbor and they have all been impressed.  I am in love with their strawberry preserves.  I also love the sauteed onions in the breakfast sandwich.  Everything is better with sauteed onions.  The orange juice is fresh squeezed and deicious."}
{"text":"We have tried this twice now and won't go back.  the noise level is so high you can't hear yourself think.  the tables are crowded together and the prices are as high as the noise level without the quality."}
{"text":"Don't go if you are in a hurry but definitely go if you're really hungry. I went on a Saturday morning and waited about 45 minutes. The servers were really friendly and not pushy even though you know they have a line of people waiting outside. I had the griddlecakes and my (very picky) friend had the salami scramble which he devoured. The food was really good, but I wasn't floored like I expected from what I've heard. I will definitely return though, it's a fun place to take people who don't venture to Phoenix much from the suburbs or are from out of town."}
{"text":"I hit a lot of airports in a year and this is by far the best breakfast available. Most airport food is like hospital food. Frozen, bland and warmed over. This morning I ordered hog & chick with a side of patty sausage. Everything is hot, fresh and made to order. Eggs over easy, thick bacon, sausage patty, country potatoes and wheat toast.  Oh, the service? Fast and friendly and they make sure everything is good. Most important, they kept my coffee hot! I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, and actually got a longer lay over today just so I could eat breakfast here. I'm so disappointed,  the service was horrible, you can here the servers talking trash about tube customers. The hottest just screamed out \"we are about to have a fight today\"! My server just served me burnt bacon, Never return things but it was bad, he docent say sorry ,or oh let me fix that, he say snotty, new bacon? , then runs of and brings be barley lest burn bacon, again no apology,  then I see him go talk shit about to the hostis. I'm so sad that this place sucks now it used to be my high light of coming to this airport, and now that I have no reason to come here anymore I will be making my connection thru a different airport all together from now on.  What bad service completely , undeserving of a tip at all."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. I loved the bacon, eggs and hash browns. Griddle cakes were very good."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never left a review for Matt's before. My wife and love this place so much. It is defiantly my favorite breakfast spot. I usually get the special or go for a scramble of some sort. Everything is always rich in flavor and the service is always great as well. Also make sure you get toast so you can enjoy their flipping amazing jelly they make in house."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast I've had at lunch time in several years.  Service is friendly and attentive only surpassed by the food!  Restaurant was clean, kitchen staff was well groomed and I highly recommend if you are in the neighborhood or looking to take a drive."}
{"text":"A delicious meal and a smile is definitely what I needed today! I was having a bad day, and needed to get a quick bite. From moment I walked in, the staff was helpful and positive. My order only took about 10 minutes, and was given to me with a smile. Just from the customer service alone, I would return to this place. As for the food, you have to try it for yourself! Cooked just right for me and smells amazing! Great job to the morning staff of Mike's Big Breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place seems like a cool spot from the exterior, but is an utter disappointment as soon as you cross through their opposite an of ergonomic front door. The host is rude and seems like he is trying to relive his frat star days. He accidentally crossed our name of the wait list and proceeded to seat multiple parties before us. No real apology followed and we continued to have to wait. The food is fine. Literally nothing special. Go support another local business and get better food with friendlier staff."}
{"text":"First of all, they charge $12 for Maker's Mark on the rocks. I asked for a double and barely got what would be a single pour in any respectable bar in STL. Then after questioning the pour, the server tried to convince me they overpoured the drink. After that I ordered a BLT. Clearly they didn't explain the B in BLT stood for bread. The description in the menu said bacon, lettuce and tomato. Clearly the person in charge of doling out the bacon just got finished pouring the double shots of Maker's Mark. They told us we were getting, and they actually got excited about this, freshly made kettle chips. If they didn't open a bag of Walmart kettle chips and pour them on the plate, then I've clearly never had authentically made kettle chips. The portions are a joke, the prices are high and the servers aren't very personable or accommodating."}
{"text":"Finally getting time to get down to write the review for this gem of a breakfast/lunch spot. Its places like this that make me want to move more and more to downtown Phoenix.  Ive been here a few times already and I try something new every time. I do have to say that the steak and eggs has been the fav thus far. A true man's man meal meant to satisfy that inner lumberjack. They cooked the steak just the way I like it which rarely happens. Unless you go to some pricey steak house, they always like to cook well done or still moving. Not Matts I washed it down with their  absolutely refreshing, fresh squeezed oj. Even their toast and jam was addicting. Breakfast has to be my favorite meal of the day, so a ideal breakfast spot is key. Matts has secured its way as a top performer in that category.  Moving past the enticing grub at Matts, the customer service was excellent. The place always seems busy driving by but when you go in, they usually get you in right away. The staff is more than friendly and always checking to make sure your dining experience is great. The joint is small but put together very well with a vintage, yet modern vibe. Watch out when you first sit down though, Its like planting your ass on the toilet in winter. Seats are metal so it takes a minute to warm up."}
{"text":"Solid place in Tempe to grab a good breakfast. Pancakes were good. Hash browns tasted to much butter. Pepper bacon was a nice touch"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time today and it was amazing! The staff was so friendly I wondered for a second if I knew them. Lol the coffee was nice and hot. The food was delicious, nutritious, fulfilling, so tasty, and the portions are generous. My husband and I eat out a lot. We couldn't decide between Le Grande Orange or Matt's Big Breakfast, as far as which was better. We were so surprised but we loved it!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. The place is small so it fills up fast and gets very noisy...not something you want with breakfast ...especially if the side of bacon is served cold."}
{"text":"Ok.  I'm finally getting in tune with Yelp and I'm writing a long overdue review of one of my favorite restaurants of all time-Matt's Big Breakfast.  When I think of what is important to me in a restaurant, it's two things plain and simple-food and service-and Matt's excels at both.  Honestly, these are the type of people, Matt and Ernie and their staff, that America's needs more of...good hearted, honest, hard working people who give a shit about their customers.  They're as American as Apple Pie!    The food: everything on the menu is very good but in my mind two things stand out and they are as good as it gets in Phoenix...the waffle and the cheeseburger.  Oh, and the bacon.  A cheeseburger brushed with butter.  Get the fuck outta town.  This is the mother fuckin shit y'all.  I consider myself a burger afficianado and this burger is the bombay.    There is an occasional wait because Guy Fieri pimps this place on the Food Network all the time but hell, why wouldn't he, it's the shit.  I pimp it all the time myself.  I may get a Matt's Big Breakfast logo on my pimpstick it's so good.  The best times to go are during the weekdays in the early morning around 7AM or after 1:00PM.    GoGOGOGOGOGOOGOG....you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I stopped here during a 4 hour layover and had the waffles and they were great.  I had cranberry juice and water and was well satisfied.  This was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Went in to get brunch with my boyfriend. We sat at the bar. It took some time for the bartender to notice us, but they were busy- so I understand! I ordered the Reuben sandwich and my boyfriend got the BLT. I hate rye bread so I nicely asked the bartender if I could change the bread. Basically anything besides rye would have been great. He then proceeded to tell me in no possible way could the kitchen do that. I thought he was joking! He wasn't. My boyfriend asked if he could change his bread to rye bread. The bartender again says no because they \"save the rye for certain sandwiches only.\" What the heck? I've never heard of that before. Well, here's a solution! Why doesn't my boyfriend get my rye and I'll take his bread! We got another no. Again, I'm so confused. Not sure what his problem was, but we felt extremely uncomfortable. He made it seem like we were making a big fuss. We went ahead and ordered it how its made. Once the food came out we just switched the bread ourselves. I don't see why they couldn't have done that in the first place. We never saw the bartender again. Drinks were empty, service was just plain BAD. I'm a server myself and I've never experienced anything like that before. I really wish I would have got the bartenders name. I don't think we will be back :/"}
{"text":"I love this location! The food is amazing and I think that staff that works here is great. I usually go on my lunch break so I usually order to go. Daniel usually takes my order and he is the best! He is always greeting everyone who walks in the door and always helping out with whatever is needed."}
{"text":"I visited Matt's for the first time in 2010 before moving to Phoenix. Not only was the food fantastic the staff was over the top too. I've been recommending this place to everyone that I know who plans to visit. Great atmosphere and the experience of the food and staff was again just amazing. Even if you have to wait it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to come here for months. Consistently spoken of as one of the best breakfast joints in Phoenix. Happy coincidence that I was downtown in AM on Eggs Benedict day! Ambience is casual just like I like it, but the Eggs Benedict were first class. Delicate, homemade Hollandaise, real thick-cut Canadian bacon (not just thin sliced Lunch meat), toasty English muffin and perfectly cooked eggs. Hash browns were crispy & fresh--and plentiful. Can't wait to come back again and try more items from the menu!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love a good breakfast!       My first experience at this quaint little establishment was this past weekend, my sister, her boyfriend....my girlfriend and I decided we needed a bite to eat after a looong night of celebrating....they chose to make the trek from Gilbert to our side of town...our first logical choice laying in bed with a swelling head you ask?  Of course we had to try Matt's...after all, we had been hearing for weeks about the bountiful breakfast that awaited....       I absolutely love something about a place that can make you feel as though your a tourist in your own town...and this one does it, very small inside....no waiting area except the side walk in front....you have to \"sign in\" on an ordering pad (cute touch in my opinion)...any how, after seeing what we were up against....I thought the worst, you know what I'm talking about....long wait!  Thankfully I was wrong, we were sat within about 10 minutes!  (Side note, I think we were a bit lucky on timing....as we left, there were a LOT more people waiting, I believe we got there around 9-9:30)       Ok....for breakfast we all tried about the same thing.....\"The Hog and Chick\"....fancy(kind of ;) way of saying eggs and some kind of swine....anyhow, all the basics are included here...potatoes (your choice, home fries or hash brown)  I chose home fries...and let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised...with out a doubt the best I'd ever had!  Along with the potatoes there were onions and fresh rosemary....honestly the rosemary made them.  The eggs were cooked wonderfully....over easy seems like an easy fix...but its truly amazing how many times this can be a disaster.  My best friend had the ham....and let me tell ya...Nicki loves some good ham...and she got it!         I have read some other reviews of this place....some talking of prices too steep....not sure where they were coming from, but all four of us....huge plates, soft drinks and or milk....with tip about 45 dollars...not sure I would classify that as \"over the top\"....not for a meal of this magnitude...maybe Denny's...but hey if you want that...you know where to go ;)       Only quark with our truly wonderful experience you ask?....we got the wrong drinks....regular instead of diet....other than that, the wait staff was cheery and funny...two things that are a must with me when I'm baby sitting a hang over.  Like I said...I love a good breakfast...Matt's truly delivers!  Thanks Matt....I will be back, very soon!"}
{"text":"I love Matt's Big Breakfast so was glad I had enough time to eat before my flight. I ordered the 3 egg omelet. The server asked me if I wanted cheese and if I wanted anything else in the omelet. I ordered provolone mushroom spinach and peppers. The food was good but the surprise was when I got the bill as I was charged for the cheese and the veggies. Did not realize I would be charged as the server made no indication and I did not initially ask for these items until prompted.  Beware."}
{"text":"Finally got something I've never had at this place: Good service....obviously a Phoenix landmark that should be visited by all at least once, but new location loses some of the old charm.  Limited menu, but pretty good...expect a long line..."}
{"text":"I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich for lunch. I could barely taste the pesto. It would be better if it was served with pesto instead of, what I'm assuming they do, just marinating the chicken breast cutlet. The macaroni salad was amazing and it is the only reason why I'm writing this review.  Great macaroni salad."}
{"text":"Great Airport Burger  & steak Fries!"}
{"text":"Amazing Food! The staff is very friendly and the service was fast and fresh. The food was delicious and came out very hot and fresh. The staff seemed to help each other out and the best part was they never let your coffee cup get empty!"}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed with my experience at Matt's Big Breakfast, although I visited the place prompted by reviews from others.  The location is cute and the place delivers wholesome foods made with fresh, organic ingredients.  The breakfast fare here is nothing spectacular, although they do simple brunch foods well.  Don't expect anything fancy or fusion.    My waffle was perfectly adequate, and while I thought the almost spaghetti-like hash browns were interesting/tasty, the rest of my table disagreed.  Standard breakfast fare done simply, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"It's just a regular breakfast place. I can't say nothing special about it. The food comes in large portions hence the name big matt's. I honestly don't like my food portions that big so I won't be going back. But if your okay with some ordinary and big portions it's a good place to go to."}
{"text":"Easter Sunday breakfast was worth the wait.  Awesome food and portions.  Friendly staff who really hustle, too."}
{"text":"Organic style breakfast with limited menu but daily specials. Wait time anywhere from 30-45 minutes although I did come on Memorial Day. Service is quick & the food is good! I got \"The Skinny\" and it was very tasty. They have bar seating but no alcohol. If they give you a \"window\" seat it is actual a bar seat in front of a window that faces the street. I will return!"}
{"text":"Great food. Got a veggie scramble. A lot of food! Good house potatoes that are seasoned with rosemary. The rye bread was very good also. Only complaint was the water tasted gross and consequently the ice tea tasted gross. They should use filtered water if the tap is that bad."}
{"text":"Ate here since it was relatively close to the airport, and it was good but not great. The waffle was buttery with a light crunch. I wish it came with some fresh fruit or something to top it off with though, it was a bit plain by itself. The menu is quite small as well."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot.  Visited initially because of the triple D exposure but definitely plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Friendly. Delicious. Fun. Awesome. DEFINITELY stop here--great food. Very reasonable prices. Best part is the service is outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast, good service, long waits. 3 1/2 stars.  I first went to Matt's Big Breakfast years ago when it had first become really popular. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it's still going strong years later--although I wasn't as excited to have to wait in a long line, just like before! The new setting is at least twice as big as it used to be, so it packs in a lot more people than in years past. Although they're still turning out some solid food, it doesn't seem as inspired as before. It seems to me that the push to grow has resulted in some decrease in quality. Maybe this is a nostalgia thing for me--the past is always better in my memory.  Setting: This place has a very cozy feel to it. You sit very close to your neighbors, so you shouldn't bring your most private conversations here. I like the breakfast bar area the most. It's a pretty simple setting--it's about t he food!  Food: I have had a number of items here over the years, and they've all been really good. The bacon and sausage selection has always been particularly good. During my latest visit, I had the day's special, which was a 3-egg scramble with sausage, spinach, mushrooms, and some cheese, served with potatoes and toast. I think that the savory dishes like this (as opposed to sweeter dishes like pancakes and waffles) are what Matt's does the best. I wasn't really impressed with the sausage in this scramble. It seemed more like a mass-manufactured sausage than anything I remember having at Matt's before. The potatoes were over-oiled, but everything else was decent. The highlight of my breakfast may have been the preserves for my toast. The blackberry preserves were really good! Lots of chunks of real berries. Despite what I said about the savory vs. sweet thing, the waffle was pretty good, too.  Service: Solid. There is usually a decent wait here, especially on weekends. The best time to come is during the week if you are able to do so, because the weekend waits can be an hour long.  I'll come back when I have the opportunity again in the future, but my breakfast attention has drifted elsewhere."}
{"text":"Butter Burger. For breakfast.  What part of that is ambiguous?  No reason to waste space saying what has already been said: best breakfast in town. Sure Matt is mean to me. And I don't go there enough. But my wife is 10 years younger than me and I have to maintain my svelte figure."}
{"text":"The breakfast menu is fantastic and the service is top notch. Every time I go there, though, I have to ask them to move the baby highchairs and extra metal seats out of the narrow hallway so I can reach the ADA bathroom. I have tried to explain to them it is against the law to inhibit access by clogging up the pathway to using the facilities. They say but we have no where else to store these chairs. Then, next time I return, we do the same horse and pony show again...and again."}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars under the qualification that it is airport food.  We arrived for breakfast and the place was packed. We only waited a few minutes to be seated, but the wait was much longer for folks that arrived shortly after us. The hostess was friendly. The waitress was not the best but what can I say...it's an airport and people are in a hurry to get to their planes. The food was good. We had the very tasty sonrisa burrito that did indeed put a smile on my face. The place is located in terminal B."}
{"text":"Oh my! Everything is as it should be at Matt's. The waffles are from scratch. The seasoning on the potatoes is addicting. In a time of house BBQ sauces and organic syrups Matt's breaks the mild with their house ketchup. I can't explain the feeling of eating a hearty breakfast made from fresh ingredients. What reminds you of a greasy spoon diner ends up being a beautiful place for serious coffee and food. I would advise you to not pass Matt's by because of the wait. The time goes fast and they turn tables over quickly."}
{"text":"I love the food here. They open early and always have a crowd. The menu was accommodating for non-pork eaters as well, so that is a huge plus for my fiancé and I."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last month. I had read a lot of reviews and was expecting a wait. It was about 15-20 minutes so it was not too bad, and definitely worth it. The place is just so cute inside. The bread was amazing and the preserves were awesome. I love that they only cook with real butter and olive oil. The husband loves green Tabasco on his eggs (any pretty much everything else) and they didn't have any so that was a bummer but the food was very fresh. A very unique place, I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Everytime I visit Phoenix I try to visit Matt's. It has my favorite pancakes. I would recommend the home fries over the hash browns. The omelettes are generous with cheese. The menu is pretty simple but there is enough choices to pick from. The portions are pretty large and this place is really affordable. The staff is always friendly and the seating is comfortable. It can get a little loud but we try to go earlier to avoid waiting and loud groups."}
{"text":"Proof that great things come in small packages :) Matt's Big Breakfast is SMALL, lol!   The local organic coffee that they serve is awesome & I have to drink it even when I'm melting outside.  My must have, by far though, is the honey lemonade.... oh yeah!   Everything they make is fresh, organic & delicious. I had the breakfast special. I have to say that the eggs tasted a bit different to me, but maybe it's because I've rarely had REAL eggs before, lol. I'm used to the thin shelled, mass produced, break up a bunch & keep them in a container till someone orders something with eggs in it kind of taste. They don't even crack them open until they are making your order. Cage free eggs from happy well fed chickens is the way to go :)  The only con I have to point out is the waiting line if you don't get yourself down there early enough. Especially in this heat! My friend decided that we should, but if her makeup started melting off we'd have to find somewhere else for breakfast, lol. Fortunately, we were called in just on time!"}
{"text":"I like the new digs ;)   The new location, although larger, still feels snug & homey to me. The personnel are wonderful as ever! Friendly and competent :)  The food is delicious, as always. I had the Hog & Chick, which is 2 eggs, thick cut bacon & home fries. The eggs where just the right size (I was complaining about tiny eggs at another establishment earlier, lol), the bacon was perfect & my favorite part were the home fries, which were cooked to perfection. My daughter had the Waffle. I'd tell you how that was but she had inhaled it before I got a chance to taste it :D She told me it was really good & it's too bad I didn't get any, lol!  This time around my baby & I stopped in after hiking South Mountain. You know how some people look good no matter what they've been doing? That's not me, lol. But I have no shame, I stopped in anyway! You'll see all kinds here, people dressed to impress, some who look like they're headed to work, others who look like they're having a PJ party, some who look like they're going to or coming from the gym & then some who've just come off a mountain :D Regardless, it's one happy family here & there's a feeling of real camaraderie, all based around the love of fresh, yummy food!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Love that they advertise their use of cooking with cage free eggs and real butter and evoo. Makes the quality of food that much better! Came on a Saturday morning around 10 and with a party of 6 I expected there to be a decent wait but within minutes we were seated! Guy working at the front was awesome, very friendly and efficient! Our waitress was just okay but the food was great!! Hubby got the waffles and they were honestly phenomenal. And as for the bacon, I cannot wait to go back and get some more! Bacon was out of this world. Great food at decent prices, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great Breakfast - fresh ingredients, professional service and a nice atmosphere. The daily breakfast specials are off the charts."}
{"text":"It was really good nice place to eat but if you have to wait on parties or other people to show up I don't like that you have to wait for everybody to show up at one time"}
{"text":"Loud, busy, but not bad. French toast was good, loved the whole sausage and pork chop got a thumbs up. The chairs aren't comfortable, 5'2 and my legs and feet were falling asleep. Wakes was nice, had to ask for water twice. They don't have cream for coffee, just milk. The place was kinda small but loved the decor."}
{"text":"I've heard many people ranting and raving about this place and I was a thinking it was \"too good to be true\".  I went, I tried, and yes, friends - it is so good and so true!  The breakfast here is \"wait - for - it\".....LEGENDARY!  The toast was good, thick and crunchy.  Same goes for the bacon!  The hash browns were probably one of the best hash browns I have ever had.  They were cooked oh-so-perfectly and we didn't have to wait too long to get a table."}
{"text":"I am so happy that there is another Matt's in the Phoenix area! Sometimes, I don't like going downtown so Camelback and 32nd Street is the perfect area.  We came on a Monday morning and the restaurant was not crazy and no wait for a table. I have no idea if the word is out and if there's a long wait on the weekends (like the downtown one). The service is pretty good and the food is just like I know Matt's to be - freaken delicious!   I ordered the Hog & Chick and hubby ordered the Five Spot. Total of the bill: a little over $20."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place from so many friends and colleagues that I had to try it for myself.  So, I head into downtown Phoenix between breakfast/lunch to grab a bite.  I got lucky and found a parking spot in front just down the street....be warned though, it's metered parking and it's an old school meter, so you need quarters & dimes.  I only had enough for 45 min, so I prayed that it wouldn't be packed inside and that I could get in/out without a parking ticket.  I walked in and found a seat at the bar.  I saddled up to the counter and browsed the menu.  I ended up ordering:  Five Spot Breakfast Sandwich (Eggs, Cheese, Caramelized Onions, Thick Cut Bacon) w/Hash Browns, $5.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix-2?select=BnXYQfUHaR_ajW8_Wy5oUA#BnXYQfUHaR_ajW8_Wy5oUA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix-2?select=Ky1EPe539GhuY-nM_9J5RA#Ky1EPe539GhuY-nM_9J5RA  The order came out fast.  I took one bite and loved it.  It was full of flavor...the Caramelized Onions really added to the taste of this Sandwich, I was impressed.  The Bacon tasted great, but was a little undercooked for my tastes...I should've known better and asked for it to be cooked crispy, especially since it was thick-cut...my bad.  It was till a great Sandwich anyway.  Except for the Caramelized Onions, it's exactly how I'd make a breakfast Sandwich.  The Hash Browns were good too, went well with the Sandwich.  The service was great, I was in/out in 30 min....so I had 15 min to spare on the meter.  Lunch menu looks interesting, I'll have to come back and give it a try.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"OK, I've wanted to try Matt's for a while, but I had drivien by and seen how small it was and heard of the long lines to get in. When I get up, I'm hungry and ready to eat...  I happened to get up early last Saturday and thought \"Hey, maybe I can get a seat at Matt's if I get over there early!\" In a few minutes, my companion and I were on the road and on the way to Matt's as fast as her little Scion XB could carry us...  My master plan was a success and we were seated within minutes of arriving. I ordered the Chop & Chick, and my friend ordered the special which was a scramble with chicken sausage, cheese, and greens.  We were seated at the window bar and enjoyed several cups of good diner coffee (nice and strong, without being bitter) while we waited...   and waited... and waited...  We noticed several tables come and go while we were waiting and as we were starting to get worried, Matt came to our table and apologetically told us that our ticket had fallen and gotten lost for a while and that our food was their top priority at that point. In the next five minutes, I'm pretty sure that every employee came by to apologize to us and ask if there was anything that they could get for us.  When our food did arrive is was steaming hot and delicious.   The Chop & Chick was exactly as one would expect. Perfectly cooked over-easy eggs, no gooey whites, but plenty of liquid yolk with which to dip my home fries in. The pork chop was of average breakfast size, but cooked well and still nice and juicy.  My companion's special scramble was so good that it made me question my undying love of the majikal animal (pork) and the hash browns were awesomely crispy (but begging to be covered in gravy ;-)  As we ate, Matt came by and apologized again for losing our ticket and asked us to enjoy our breakfast on the house. It was so good that I kinda felt bad about taking them up on their offer, but I decided that I'd make it up to them by going out of my way for more early breakfasts there.  So, was it a perfect breakfast experience? No. But the manner in which the mistake was handled, the professionalism of the staff, and the quality of the food puts Matt's Big Breakfast at or near the top of my Phoenix breakfast list."}
{"text":"I would give them 5 stars if their coffee was better. Everything else however is fabulous! The bacon, rosemary potatoes, fluffy griddle cakes aka pancakes are to die for!"}
{"text":"The special - sweet and savory French toast - was amazing! The omelets and home fries were superb. Even the wheat toast was phenomenal with homemade preserves.  We are planning breakfast for the trip home!"}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to the hype. I love their breakfast and would go every day if I could. The line may be long but it's definitely worth it.   My favorite meal to get is to split a waffle and cheese omelet with a friend. What really makes the meal is the potatoes! The rosemary gives them such a nice flavor and I wish I could eat them for every meal. I also love the bread and jam. It's an all-around perfect meal and I won't stop going there. This location is very crowded but it definitely has a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"How can something so simple taste this wonderful?  Mine is not to question, but simply to enjoy. The omelet with hash browns and sour dough toast with strawberry preserves was excellent. The bread has the proper balance of crunchy and chew!  That is the only way to describe the bread!  The pepper bacon was phenomenal today. Not too crunchy and really lean."}
{"text":"They have the best bacon in town. I'm sure it is sourced locally. If you find yourself downtown at breakfast time, do yourself a favor and drop by for some fresh O.J., coffee, and anything on the menu (that includes bacon). There is many times a wait, especially on weekends. Allow an extra 15 minutes in case."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME.. Went twice this week. Tuesday and Wednesday.. This is my favorit stop for breakfast everytime Im in town. Food is good, prices are good the coffee is awesome. Love this place. the waitress Trina is so nice.. Food is always hot and fresh.. You can taste the quality...."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a family oriented sometimes you get the chances to see the owners serving you or their children. This makes the restaurant more comfortable for the audience because the staff is really nice. Even though, the there is at least a 40 min wait to get into this restaurant, the wait it is all worth. Once you get in, the food comes out so quick and not only that their concept is also make everything with natural ingredients. For example, the made their drinks with honey instead of sugar.Also they have a variety of options of food for you to choose."}
{"text":"Because of the famous Triple D, we had to make an appearance. The wait wasn't so bad, about 15 minutes for a Wednesday morning. But it def picked up after we were seated so go early.  The menu was very simple. I really wanted to try their Biscuits and Gravy but they only serve them on Tuesday, I think. Different special every day. I came on the wrong day.   Everything was good. $60 for four people for a 15 minute breakfast seemed high. I understand paying more for better ingredients but dang people, let me enjoy it!!! We were so rushed to eat (pressured to order fast AND received our check after my second bite). I like to sit an enjoy a meal, especially brunch time!!   So great food, but no time to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Awesome place! It was packed but we had great service at the counter, the menu options were great with organic items and cage free eggs.  The home fries are out of this world! Fun atmosphere, they know what they are doing here!"}
{"text":"It's diner food that's decent, but nothing stood out to us as worth another visit. The staff made us feel incredibly rushed, brought our bill with the food, never checked on us, and started clearing the table as soon as we took our last bites. The restaurant was half empty so we weren't sure why they were rushing us out."}
{"text":"If you are anywhere in the areas and need breakfast this is the place to go! Great food and fast service. You will not leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Great food! The waffle is delicious and you could never go wrong with the special! Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Today happens to be the first day of my Thanksgiving break, so I figured I should hit up a breakfast or lunch place that I wouldn't normally get to go to.  I read up on some of the reviews here and felt a bit unsure, as there are lots of negative ones but decided that I trust David SB, Mr. K and Pierre much more than all the naysayers.  I'm glad I did.  I also, for some unexplainable reason, did not think there would be such a long wait on a random Wednesday morning.  I mean, don't people have jobs?  We ended up waiting about a half hour, which wouldn't have been bad but it also happens to be one of five days that it rains in Phoenix.  The wait was long, and both Nathan S. and I were getting close to regretting our decision.  There was great people watching though- a man running into The Coronado Hotel (that boasts an RCA electronic system and refrigeration) with a case of Natty Light, many people rushing out of Matt's to save their car from the meter police and just generally, the meter police vehicle.  We were seating and immediately served coffee which I don't usually drink.  Nathan S. assured me that this is not the kind of place with french vanilla creamer, which is sad for me, but overall a good thing and compliment to Matt's taste.  I ordered the griddle cakes and a side of hash browns.  Our food arrived at different times which wasn't cool but I figure that kitchen is tiny.  It didn't take too long for his to arrive, so we just had to wait a few minutes to dig in.  One word- BUTTERTASTIC!  I am not a breakfast girl, and I attempt to eat healthy (mostly to offset the booze intake) but this was amazing.  I knew it was a very naughty breakfast, but delicious all the same.  Nathan S. also commented that the mushrooms in his omelet had definitely been marinated in butter prior to being put into the omelet, which made me like this place more.  If you are into naughty breakfasts, Matt's is your kind of place."}
{"text":"Coffee cup was dirty, the replacement cup was dirty too. Both times they served it. Do they not look at the cups before serving it?And do they not wash dishes?"}
{"text":"A perfect breakfast. I went twice in two days when I was in Phoenix at a conference. The food was well-prepared, the service good and the prices right where they should be. My only gripe is that I didn't see an option for a half order and the servings are huge. People should always have the option of eating less and wasting less."}
{"text":"Never had the chance to try the food... When I asked them how long the wait would be they told me they don't give wait times.... Snooty"}
{"text":"The waffles/syrup and eggs were mediocre. Sausage, bacon and homestyle potatoes were really good!!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to eat here for years and finally made it. It was a Tuesday around 11:00AM, it was very busy but not packed so I only waited for about ten minutes.   I ordered a cup of coffee to drink and the cheese omelette with a side order of bacon. Ordering the side of bacon was a must based on word of mouth and all of the reviews.   Coffee was very good and fresh.   My omelette was excellent, fluffy and full of melted American cheese. It was served with either hash browns or home style potatoes. I opted for the potatoes and they didn't disappoint. Seasoned with rosemary which was unique and delicious.   Now to that bacon...It was probably the best bacon I have ever had. Thick cut, peppered and tender. Cooked just right. Oh so good. All of those reviews were spot on.   I am already looking forward to my next visit.   Matt's is a must!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! It's usually pretty packed here, though a little less busy than their downtown location.   They offer your usual breakfast and lunch menu. Nothing weird!  I usually order the cheese omelette with a side of bacon. They have really amazing bacon!  Their hash browns are really good too.   One of these days I'll try lunch, but it's really hard to stray from their amazing breakfast.   Be sure to allow some time, chances are you will be waiting for a table.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch Sunday and the food was terrific!  We had a party of six and wrre seated in the semi-private area. The menu is small and straight forward.  The food was hot and delicious.  The servings huge,vand the ingredients fresh.  It was wonderful.  Will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"This was the aboslute BEST breakfast I have ever had. Every single ingredient is so fresh and tasty. I ordered a cheese omlet with a side of pancakes. My sis and I shared it. We also got orange juice and coffee. We were in heaven! We did not have 1 single complaint. From the service to cleanliness to the food it was a 10!! If you are looking for a delicious breakfast experience THIS IS THE PLACE!!   I plan on going back asap!"}
{"text":"Killer breakfast spot - great food - great people Pork and Eggs - Really more like half a smoked ham and some eggs - WoW"}
{"text":"Matt's has great food and service. We felt warmly welcomed and our server took time to patiently answer our many question. The food is very, very good, and actually healthy. They use many local organic ingredients and you can taste the difference. Our litmus test at every breakfast or lunch restaurant, to see if they really care, is to check the ketchup bottle to see if it lists high fructose corn syrup as an ingredient. The logic is that natural sugar ketchup costs more, and restaurants who serve it up really care about our health and theirs, down to the smallest detail. Matt's passed the test! The food is ample and delicious, and you will leave very satisfied."}
{"text":"stopped in today with some friends for lunch and got the scrambled eggs with hash browns, cheese, and sausage.  The hash browns were cooked awesome and the sausage was amazing.    The place is kinda small, and VERY loud (it was pretty busy).  It also has a whole \"hippie\" feel going on which was a little weird, but i didn't care, the food was good and Our waitress (and almost all the others) were hot!"}
{"text":"There's little more to say that hasn't already been said.  Matt's has very familiar items on their menu, but each that I've tried really is impressively delicious!  Expect to wait...if you're impatient there are plenty of others who are willing to wait (me included) for 40+ minutes on a very empty stomach."}
{"text":"This was a YELP guided breakfast stop on our Spring Training week food tour. I trust YELPers to guide me to the best places and they always come through. They were right on about the wait. Mid week around 9am and there was about a 30 minute wait with lots of people waiting outside the tiny little restaurant. Luckily we were just a 2 waiting for a seat, as opposed to the party of 9 who would have to be broken up or wait for hours to be seated.... (HINT HINT, not a place for groups. 2 is ideal. 3-4 is max unless you do not care about sitting together.)  Having been on day four of greasy high caloric breakfasts, I opted for the steel cut oatmeal with the raisins and brown sugar and an OJ. SG got standard egg plate with eggs, toast, ham and rosemary potatoes. SG was very happy when his plate arrived. The large piece of ham and the delicious rosemary potatoes set this place aside in his mind. My oatmeal was very good, but my humungous raisins put it over the top. The service was great and Matt himself was even there helping out.   SG said this is how a breakfast place should be done and this is the model he would use for his own breakfast place (that will most likely never happen). The menu is limited, but offers the usuals. There is special attention paid to those things like the potatoes and the raisins that makes this place special.   Check it out. Expect a wait, bring a news paper."}
{"text":"Food is great....5 stars.  The wait....1 star.  Sorry...no place is worth two hours for breakfast."}
{"text":"The hype is huge....but well deserved. One of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Everything is so clean, servers are helpful, friendly, and effective.....and the food is outstanding.  If you haven't eaten here by now, what are you waiting for."}
{"text":"Awesome place but the wait is dumb. Also the way they handle it is archaic and not efficient for how long the line is.   Because they have a paper list and so many waiting guest everyone stands in the lobby blocking the servers from getting around. One girls sole job is to walk around and scream names of people on the list. Inside and outside. Another girl spends half her day explaining to guest that they never quote a time and no the can't just sit at the counter like other restaurants. To many staff not enough system. Counter productive, and un-scale able. Labor cost are prolly killing this place.  Business aside... Food was great and staff is friendly! I'll come back if I have all morning to wait around"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast spot. The home fries were amazing. Had fresh rosemary on them. Get some fresh juice and the coffee was spot on."}
{"text":"Their food is so simple and there is very few options to choose from. It's not worth the price. I paid with cash and the waiter didn't give me my change back."}
{"text":"If you want simple breakfast nailed to perfection, with excellent customer service, I highly recommend this place.  As always, I tried to keep my expectations super low because of the hype, but honestly, it deserves the hype!  It was rainy today so we got an unusual late start on the day. Worked in our favor because there was no wait when we arrived (about 1pm).  Everyone there was super nice. Like, genuinely nice. We ordered coffee and the fresh squeezed honey lemonade. The lemonade was delish! They must put a ton of honey in there because you can really taste the flavor. It's so good. The coffee is great too. It's a special blend made especially for Matt's from Cave Creek roasters.   For food we got the special - 3 egg scramble with andouille sausage and fontina cheese. Omg... Now you can imagine how easily it would be to screw up this dish. But it was not greasy, eggs cooked perfectly, and the HASHBROWNS WERE THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. No seriously, how do they get those hashbrowns so crunchy?!?! The andouille sausage was nice and spicy. Great dish.  It came with a side of sourdough toast and fresh house made strawberry compote. Soooo good and fresh. Compote not too sweet. Great!  The waffle was light and crispy. Bacon was the real deal y'all. Thick. Crispy. And they have REAL maple syrup.  So...they forgot our waffle and we had to remind them of it. No big deal at all to us. But the way they handled it, they comped the waffle and apologized over and over. Over the top customer service. Over the top.  It really doesn't get any better than this for me. Simple food cooked perfectly and great customer service. And the place is adorable too. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I arrived in Phoenix from San Francisco and was starving so I Yelp'ed breakfast joints in the area and Matt's Big Breakfast was one of the places with the most quality reviews so I said why not?  Upon arriving there were a number of small parties waiting outside so I knew it was going to be a long wait. Me and my sister ended up waiting an hour as the morning Phoenix sun started creeping up on us. We were able to sit at the counter which was awesome because I was able to see Matt cook in the kitchen. I ordered the hog and chick which consisted of scrambled eggs, fat slices of bacon, hash brown and wheat toast. In addition I ordered the orange juice which was freshly squeezed. The toast is freaking amazing! Best toast I've ever had! The homemade jam was tasteful because it didn't taste like the nasty jam you would get at normal diners. The hash brown was perfect! Crispy brown on the top and bottom and juicy in the inside. The hash brown was the best I've had because it wasn't dry which makes eating that much more enjoyable. The bacon... It was freaking delicious! 4 fat slices of bacon. Yum! I rarely finish my breakfast but I surprisingly finished the hog and chick plate at Matt's.  I will most definitely be back if I'm ever in then phoenix area. This is the best breakfast joint in Arizona and maybe the west coast. Try it out but beware of the wait."}
{"text":"The BEST breakfast spot in all of Arizona!! There's a special everyday!! I go here every Friday an the food is always on point!!"}
{"text":"This is a place that truly knows the art of breakfast. Their bacon is hog heaven, their eggs are perfection, their hash browns and home fries are off the charts, and the service is just as good as their bacon. This place is 5+ stars in my books. I wish I took a picture, but my motor skills weren't working fast enough to take the picture, the fork was in my mouth too soon."}
{"text":"The staff was very pleasant and friendly. I ordered the Special which was 3 eggs \"scrambled \" with jalapeño sausage and cheese with a dude of homestyle potatoes. The eggs were still runny and sausages didn't even seem to be cooked all the way.  The potatoes were still hard... Its likely I won't order from there again.... what a waste of $16...  I work in the building next store and would rather drive somewhere else than eat that food again."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing!  Overpriced $8:00 for plain pancakes which came with maple syrup - then charged extra for a bit more maple syrup.  Pancakes were dry and flavorless.  Oatmeal was good. Home fries were sludge - far from crispy.  Thick bacon would have been good but for way too much pepper.  Waitress was a humorless zombie.  Also refused to do two separate checks.  Geez how hard is that!! We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food is good. Simple. Not worth the prices nor the wait. A small glass of orange juice is $2.50, which seemed a little pricey. Menu is small.  Highly recommend going just to try it yourself, seeing how much fame it gets. I think they can pull it off giving that there's not many places that serve breakfast downtown."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast!  Best breakfast downtown!  Guy Fieri's been here!!!!!  Hold on a minute.... once you get over the hype, unfortunately, you find that Matt's is just average.  We went recently and contended with the customary long wait for our table.  Once seated in the cramped, homey space, we were ready to be dazzled.  Problem is, my griddlecakes were just average.  In fact, the pancakes I make at home (America's Test Kitchen recipe) are probably better.  My daughter's waffle was fine, but again, nothing extraordinary.  Our waitress seemed to always be forgetting something - water, oj, side dish, etc.  For the hassle, Matt's is not worth it.  I'd rather have breakfast at Province in the new Westin down the street.  Once you get over the hype, you'll get over Matt's."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito was delicious. It was filled with peppers and chunks of bacon. Matt's obviously specializes in bacon."}
{"text":"stopped in again last sunday before picking someone up at the airport. breakfast was flawless (again). i had the hog and chick this time and was very happy. hashbrowns were crispy, but not burnt. eggs were scrambled and fluffy. the jam of the day was strawberry, and some of the best i have ever had. love me some sourdough toast & jam. i waited less than 5 minutes ( it was only me), sat at the bar, and enjoyed swift, friendly service. coffee was fine but not great. if matt's is going to improve, i say the coffee is where to start."}
{"text":"What's not to love?   Cool small-diner atmosphere, crazy good food, ginormous portions, decent coffee (so many places underestimate the power of a good cup of joe), and you can laugh at Guy's stencil near the register.   4-egg chorizo and jalapeno scramble... if you see it on the board, GET IT."}
{"text":"This place is very popular, they have a very flexible schedule and are open very early 6:30, and they have a very fast service that I really enjoyed. But i didnt like their fresh squeezed orange juice (that didnt taste fresh at all) and their food wasnt very well seasoned. I have mixed feeling about this place. Their price is okay and you can probably share with someone else. Their strawberry jelly is very good"}
{"text":"For so long I have been encouraged to explore the breakfast happenings at this local spot in Phoenix.  I believe I am going to be one of the few who was not wowed by what Matt had to offer.  Matt's gets a big gold star for its earth friendly and locavore kitchen.  The menu features \"cage free eggs from humanely raised chickens\", grain fed pork and natural beef, as well as local organic produce.  You will only find a breakfast and lunch menu here, and the items are unpretentious and down-home - virtually anything I could easily whip up in my own kitchen such as BLT's, tuna salad sandwhich, tossed cobb, and burgers.  As the name infers, breakfast is big here.  And greasy and indulgent.  The \"five spot\" breakfast sandwhich appears to be the most popular item here and comes on a roll with two eggs, two slices of bacon, American cheese, and grilled onions.  (Personally, I feel American is the worst cheese in America, and I wish that government regulators would ban it from kitchen tables.) And when you add greasy grilled onions to an already greasy sandwhich with very un-American cheese, you get some bad bed-fellows.  So, unfortuantely, this breakfast for me was under-appreciated and finished by my breakfast date who had the same thing.  Other breakfast items included omelets, salami scrambles, griddlecakes, and waffles.  Notable drink items were fresh squeezed orange juice, honey lemonade, or organic chocolate milk.  Vene Vidi Vici.  But I likely won't return."}
{"text":"I visited the Phoenix area last week and had the pleasure of eating here. The menu and décor in this place are very simple, but don't let that fool you. The food is absolutely delicious!   I ordered the special of the day, which was called the \"Classic Egg Benedict\" or something like that. At first glance, its just eggs and Canadian bacon on an English muffin along with some hash browns. However, the taste was absolutely sublime! Much better than any eggs and ham I've eaten at other breakfast type places. They put some sort of creamy sauce on top of the eggs, which really made the difference in terms of taste. It wasn't exactly the most health conscious thing I ate during my trip, but it was well worth it.   I strongly recommend this place if you're looking for a big filling breakfast and don't care about the calories. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Read this place was all the talk and have been wanting to try it out. Wait time was typical 30 mins so not bad. The food was fresh and AMAZING! the only reason I didnt give it a 5 is because I paid 3.50 for lemonade with no free refills. I would not have gotten the lemonade had I known. $3.50 is a bit much for a drink with no refills."}
{"text":"I have to say, I have never really been much of a breakfast person. With that said, Matt's Big Breakfast may change that. Why? Well, let's get crackin'! :)  The Food:  First and foremost, let's talk about the menu. It's small, but covers all you bfast must haves. Eggs to ham, oatmeal to waffles, they have you covered. They even have a big bowl of Frosted Flakes on the menu (ummmmm yum!). I got the Hog and Chick, which is two eggs any way, bacon or sausage, hashbrowns or homefries, with toast and homemade strawberry preserves. I got my eggs over easy, and I mention this becausemost places can't seem to make them right, but Matt's made them perfectly! The homefries were delish, and the toast and preserves made my tummy VERY happy.The only problem I had was with the bacon, too peppery. That is a personal preference though.   The Service: The service was good. It took about 30 min to be seated, which is to be expected. It allowed time for me to walk around a bit and chat it up with my friend. So no complaints there. Our server (and I feel terrible because I can't remember her name) was very sweet and attentive. Only towards the end did her service become slow, but the drinks and food came out in a respectable amount of time.   The Atmosphere: It is a smaller establishment, so its a little \"cozy\", but don't let that scare you away. Everyone is there to enjoy a good breakfast, so you're in good company. :) It's decor simple. It's pretty contemporary. It's very clean as well.   The Verdict: Matt's Big Breakfast is awesome! Worth the wait, and worth the trip downtown. I gave Matt's 4 stars because I wasn't a fan of the super peppery bacon, and the service got a little slow at the end. Other than those two, everything else was great! I will be returning, and with friends."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for breakfast, recommended as a must by Sheraton, and they were not wrong! I travel extensively and this is as good as it gets......great food, excellent service, wonderful teamwork by entire staff. Every dish ordered was unique and surprisingly good. Only complaint was the wait, but it is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"I went to Matt's Big Breakfast on Tuesday for the first time as I heard so much about it.  I will tell you about my experience.  There was a wait, as expected.  My sister and I didn't mind because we had a lot of catching up to do.  Our name was called and the Host asked if sitting at the bar was ok.  We said yes.  We started to sit down on the stools but decided that it was not very comfortable.  My sister noticed that there were two 2-tops available and asked the host if we could sit there.  He said that that was fine but to let him know ahead of time \"so that we didn't have to do this dance again.\"  We swallowed our pride and sat down.  The female server never smiled and we had to ask for another cup of coffee so she was probably \"slammed\" with tables.  The table next to us got their breakfast first even though they were sat after us.  We did get our food eventually by someone other than our server.  The food was fabulous as expected.  But please don't let the poor service keep you away.  I would have given all five stars had the service had been as exceptional as the food."}
{"text":"While I have raved about this place in the past, I wanted to once again extol the virtues and, more importantly, the family feel of this place. Ernie lights up the room with her smile. Once that happens, the coffee is served, and the service begins then the rest of the breakfast is just a wonderful continuation. Peg and I went for my birthday (actually, we try to extend family occasions so that we can visit the family of chefs with whom we have grown since we moved here in '97). The OJ was fresh, the specials are always superb, and there is a continuity in the kitchen that virtually assures that the quality will be stellar.  We can't wait for the new addition this month, and Peg and I always will support Matt, Ernie, and of course Christopher!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"What is so special about Matt's?  I couldn't figure it out from the pictures on Yelp.  However, our car rental guy recommended it, so we decided to give it a try.    I showed up with low expectations because I am extremely spoiled by the amazing brunch places in SF.  It can't be better than the Bay right...?  The long wait and Phoenix sun made me a little annoyed and my expectations got higher with every minute that passed by.    When we sat down, I looked around, and the whole place was pig themed.  How fitting... my fiancé and family calls me a pig all the time.  They say you are what you eat... *shrug*.  So all the signs pointed at me to order their bacon with eggs.  It sounded so simple... so what's the hype?  Their sunny side eggs was cooked to perfection for me to dip my perfectly peppered thick and crispy bacon in the runny yolk.  Their homefries were crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside cooked with caramelized onions.  Lastly, their sourdough bread was perfect with their delicious strawberry jam.  The dishes are so simple, but their ingredients and cooking skills kill it.  We came here at the beginning of our trip and I couldn't stop thinking about this place on our last day.  I wish I ate here again.  I was about to come grab bottles of their jam as gifts, but they closed early.  So much regret for not planning to come earlier...   If you are my friend and going to Phoenix and reading on my review right now, will you bring me back a jar?  Pretty please?! :D"}
{"text":"Very much appreciate the new space with bathrooms and room to move. And also happy that the food quality was not impacted the slightest. The wait makes it all the better. And that strawberry lemonade?! Whoo, tasty. Just lighten up on the ice! But for those who are looking for veggie options, they have a lil' bit, particularly the standard omelet with cheese. Would like to see a bit more variety without the meat. Otherwise great work."}
{"text":"Got the daily special on a Sunday morning. Food was oversold and under delivered. Not worth the wait for me..."}
{"text":"Really good lemonade and ham (not necessarily together). Their eggs are just eggs but they have a few unique items that really are good."}
{"text":"So sorry to say but won't be back after waiting several weeks to try. The service was horrible, had to ask someone when we could place our order. My husband had the Cobb Salad and they must have not had lettuce left so they chopped up lots of the core. I told him to send it back but he didn't want to wait again for a new plate. I had the egg with bacon, cheese and onion. The bacon was dry and burn't and the sandwich on a whole was cold. We won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years but after yesterday I will NEVER return . After ordering my food I asked for more syrup for my pancakes and they said it was additional 1.50 . You have got to be kidding me, I took my food and left will never go back . As a restaurant there are something that you just DONT do .  I respect my hard earned money way to much ."}
{"text":"Small seating area, long wait. Bathroom was in motel next door. But the food is excellent, definitely worth the wait. Good prices. Currently, my favorite breakfast experience in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"What a great place. Terrific food and friendly, attentive staff. I had the french toast combo. OMG! Delicious!  My husband had Matt's Big Breakfast. He thoroughly enjoyed it. Melinda was our server and she is amazing! The handsome, dark haired waiter who served our food is also great. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I have been here probably five times, but not for awhile.  The only reason for that is that, by the time I'm ready to get breakfast, I'm pretty hungry and can't stand waiting 30 minutes to an hour to get in.  Last Sunday, I actually packed a snack and sat on the curb to face 45 long, hard minutes of being tantalized by delicious smelling food.  I had forgotten just how great this place is.  The service is super friendly and very efficient.  Once you get in, you get served very quickly.  I could swear that they laid down our enormous spread of food within 5 minutes of us ordering, and it's not old, sitting-around-under-a-heat-lamp stuff, it's hot and fresh.  I got some eggs (fresh and cooked to perfection), and wheat toast which was thick cut and had some delicious local strawberry preserves with it, but the standout is always the hashbrowns.  They are the stuff of dreams: a giant, salty, crisp on the outside/soft on the inside, just greasy enough slab of heaven.  Sweet Pea got his usual Hog n Chick that comes with the thickest, most peppery bacon I've ever seen.  And THEN we split a waffle, also delicious (not as outstanding as the rest, but I'm not usually a waffle person.)  If you want the real deal, a straight-up BREAKFAST - no frills and newfangled foods, but just really quality delicious stuff, then pack a snack and get to Matt's. Nobody does it better."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped here for Saturday brunch after the gym.  The place wasn't very busy for being Saturday morning. It was open and airy - great atmosphere. Food was okay. It was exactly what you'd expect from a generic breakfast place. I had The Skinny, but subbed hash browns for the salad. The egg white, chicken sausage, and kale scramble was good. The hashbrowns were a little soggy.  Why I gave this place two stars was because of the service. Our server, Michelle, was a total bitch. Every question we had, she answered like we were incredibly stupid. We felt like a complete burden to her. In addition to her, the manager gave us weird, creepy vibes. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"First big shout out to Stephanie, my server. Incredibly helpful and great attitude. Same with Jonathan! They both helped me to forget about my two hour flight delay. Good was great. I could've gone 5 star easily but I think it's a 5 star for a 4 star establishment. The place to eat when you're in gate B. There's also a bar with TVs on."}
{"text":"I was skeptical but decided to try this restaurant upon hearing all the talk or hype.  My son was visiting and thinking he would order pancakes since he loves them. Well he ordered the skinny and not any pancakes. We had a short wait around 11:20 AM on a Friday cause this place stays busy.  First thing ordered was coffee and it was mediocre which was not good because now that set the tone for the meals. Our meals came out hot and delicious. As was said in a review, the menu is not big but the options on the menu are done well. Staff is great and menu is priced right. Oh and those Rosemary potatoes just fabulous."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast. Must try there waffle and  bacon. Hog & chick is amazing my wife loves there eggs and toast so fresh."}
{"text":"Always delicious !! Had their sausage with my breakfast this time, awesome!!  Extra special bonus on my last visit...hot chic working there was wearing super short, super tight skirt, and little... to no underpants..and she kept wanting to pick things up from the floor, this was a great day."}
{"text":"Work out at the Mountainside, right across the parking lot of this location.  Nice and open with a nice patio. Too bad patio's view isn't the lake and just the drive between all the tall buildings. Indoor seating is very load. Host, the day we tried, was very short and rude with us. Wasn't a great first impression.  We all tried different dishes. 2 of us were happy with their meals, 3 of us, not impressed for all the hype. And watch your coffee closely...they are so quick to top off without asking...just after you got it perfect.  We all decided to have a cocktail for dessert. If that was all we had and we didn't encounter the rude host, I would have given a 4...the margarita was the BEST! Would go back for that...but nothing else."}
{"text":"For any of you that have been to Matt's and don't like it, no offense, but we wouldn't make a good breakfast eating team.   Because I love it. I had read and heard many a glowing review of this place from friends but the lingering question in the back of my mind was \"How can bacon, toast, and eggs be that good?\" Candidly, I still don't know the answer to that question. What I do know, however, is that it is, indeed, that good, if not better than I ever dreamed simple breakfast foods could be.   The line can be a formidable obstacle. There is a pad on top of the water by the front door where people write in the name of their party and number of people and you just wait for them to call your name into the tiny restaurant. I saw quite a few people outside, content to be waiting with a book, obviously knowing what they had in store.  As for the \"too much butter\" complaint from other reviewers, my advice is don't worry about it. If you want a light breakfast, Matt's isn't what you're looking for. For an obscenely delicious plate exploding with flavor and goodness, bring a book and post up at Matt's. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Really fantastic breakfast. Not for vegetarians, I guess, because one of my dining companions was not impressed (except, I think she liked the eggs), but I was in hog heaven. Great atmosphere in a city bereft of great atmosphere. Seriously. I asked the hot counter girl what there is to do in Phoenix. She seemed confused by the question. But at least she was hot. Yeah, sorry for even going there, but all the women who worked at Matt's when I was there were really friggin' hot, and I can't honestly say as an honest Yelp reviewer that it didn't count as a factor in the number of times I returned here. But what I can also say is that I wouldn't have gone near the place, hot serving wenches notwithstanding, had the food not been completely, utterly satisfying. Totally worth a drive across the \"city\" for. Really. I mean. Being from New York, I tend to compliment nobody. I enjoyed Matt's. So congratulations, management. You hired the right people. You cook a mean egg. You know what to do with pork. All of this was appetizing, satisfying, and filling. YUM."}
{"text":"I must agree with reviewers who have been other than taken aback by the place and agree with Jerry J's assessment of it.  Took the advice of a seemingly seasoned lady I am working with. She is a doll and I trusted her judgement of this greasy spoon.  If she reads this, she'll know I'm speaking of her.  We arrived to hotel last night and she mentioned she would be going here for brunch.  I am an avid breakfast lover so sounded good to me, even spectacular.  I walked there from hotel, wrong shoes to wear my bad, no one elses, got blisters. The place looked like a dive, as I was told it would, so not surprised. Saw the menu, their special of the day was biscuits and gravy which I love.  But wanted more than carbs so opted for eggs, bacon, toast and hashbrowns.  I did ask my server, \"could I pay more and get the biscuits and gravy without the toast\", she said unfortunately no. Not her fault I understand but how dumb of the proprietors rules to make that not an option, I said I was happy to pay more.  They lost out on that option as this may have been a bettter review as she'd said the B&G were very good.  The breakfast came, unimpressed visually.  2 eggs over medium, 1 was a broken yolk but they gave it to me anyway.  I found that odd, they goofed, why give me their whoooopsie? How hard is it to make another egg? not.  The bacon was very crisp which is usually fine, but over crisped and way too much pepper is another.  The sourdough toast was wonderful as I'm a bread maker as well, and the strawberry jam was good also, not mine, but good.  The bacon I took wrapped up with the rest of the jam on it as I'll eat that later in the day when I want a little something to munch on.  The hashbrowns : oh soooo very grease laden.  Pleantiful, which I did appreciate but my gosh there is just simply no reason to douce them in oil or grease, whatever it was.  I know how the perfect hashbrowns are made and as easy as they are I would only answer the how to's if our kids asked me. They deserve my answers and recipes.   But as easy as they are, often times you get an oversogged in grease outcome.  They were hot, appreciated that but all that clear liquid just made them pasty/gooey and not in a good way.  The server was a nice young gal and of that I'm appreciative also. I won't go back nor will I tell anyone to go there.  Simply lack luster and mostly due to the food."}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat ever! I love their home cooked potatoes. I go there at least once a week. Staff is friendly and the price is right too."}
{"text":"I too saw the dinners drive in and dives show on this place. Two words, not impressed. I to was looking for the French toast which is not on the menu. I ordered the special which came out luke warm. The home frys drowning in rosemary. As my wife was still waiting for her cheese omelet which was the same luke warm. Are friend had ham and eggs which was the smart choice. At a price that we were scratching our head. Point being is don't always believe what you see and hear on TV"}
{"text":"Such a great breakfast!!  Wait was a little long.  Not sure I can say the wait was totally worth it but I loved the food!  Waffle was great!!"}
{"text":"We ate here last weekend and it was nice.  The wait was long but if you've never eaten there it's worth waiting for.  Once you get in there you'll see it's a fun place to be; a combination of hip/50's dinner with real all American food (especially breakfast).  I had the salami and eggs breakfast which was ok.  I thought the salami was way too salty.  The hash browns on the other hand are amazing.  They were made from real potatoes, cooked just right with plenty of grease and I loved every bite!  I also had a cup of coffee that was average at best.  My wife, on the other hand, had a glass of lemonade that was made from scratch and was sweetened with honey which we both thought was awesome.  If you're going to come here bring a small snack you can munch on outside because the wait could be up to an hour and a half.  Best thing is to call before you come and ask how long the wait is."}
{"text":"I had the waffle it comes with butter and delectable syrup! Hands down the best one I have ever had! For a Monday morning it was pretty busy and chaotic really made an interesting breakfast! All the employees seemed to work together to serve each table which makes it quick to get in and out. It was a great experience!"}
{"text":"This joint earns a strong five stars, and I am so lucky it is just down the street from me.  My first time was today, and on the walk back I actually considered the budget of eating there DAILY.  Could this be done?  Hmm.  I recommend this to everyone - locals and tourists!  I heard the crowds were bad - notsomuch.  I found two seats at the bar right when I walked in at around 9am on a Friday morning.  The waitress was cheerful and energetic.  I ordered the hog and chick ... phenomenal bacon.  I want to try the lemonade next time I'm there.  The guy next to me at the bar kept going on and on about how amazing it was.  Like almost sexually."}
{"text":"Really happy to find this place the morning of my flight home from Phoenix.  The servers are super cool - fun & cheery which is just what a weary traveler needs.  The couple sitting next to me were totally cracking up at their server - I had a different server but he was fun and attentive as well.    I had the breakfast burrito (vegetarian) and it was delish!   Coffee and water were kept full and the burrito was sooo good.    I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Have been eating here since the TINY spot.  The food is always so fresh and yummy and service  has always been perfect. Have tried almost everything on the menu, never been let down. Love that they try to stay local on all they cook. My favourite breakfast is the salami scramble, but the waffles are so tasty too. Lunch fav  the burgers and BLT the best. I could go on about so many other yummies on the menu, but once you try them you WILL be back. ENJOY.    P.S. brought friends from Colorado and they come every time even at airport location."}
{"text":"Had a great first experience at the Tempe location. It's located on the ground floor of one of the business buildings in the Marina, wasn't where I expected but decent signage helped me find my way. You have to park in a parking garage but during the weekdays first 2 hours are free so that's nice and it was easy parking. Matt's is a big, open restaurant. Went on Wednesday and it wasn't very crowded, service was great! Our server kept checking in without checking too much as we talked a lot before we ordered. I ordered the Salami Scramble as I saw someone raving about on Yelp! I know why! It was delicious, awesome fresh bread! They use a lot of locally produced food. I'll definitely go again when I'm in Tempe"}
{"text":"Bacon? Outstanding.  Griddle cakes?  Crave-worthy.  Home-fries?  Awesomely awesome.  Service?  Ehhh.  Love this little joint tucked into a one-bedroom house!  The food was amazing -- I can still taste those griddle cakes, BUT the service left something to be desired (more about that later).  My hubby got the three-meat scramble with hashbrowns, and it came with a tortilla.  He gobbled it down, apparently it was really good.  We never got any hot sauce, after two requests.  I ordered the two-egg breakfast with bacon.  The bacon was to die for, the best I think I've ever had.  The thick sourdough toast which accompanied my meal was served with real butter and fresh strawberry jam.  The combo was killer!  All in all, a fantastic breakfast!  About the service -- The female waitress who greeted me at the door specifically told myself and two other parties that were waiting that they ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES, no waiting at the table for someone else to show.  She must have said this three or four times.  I pointed to my hubby, who was parking the car across the street and told her he'd be here in just a minute, and she reiterated, WE ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES.  I was told to add my name to a list outside, even though he was 30 seconds away!  An older woman appears at the door and asks for a table, and tells the waitress her husband is parking the car.  \"Oh, okay, I can get you a table right now,\" says the waitress.  No \"WE ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES.\"  No \"ADD YOUR NAME TO THE LIST OUTSIDE EVEN THOUGH HE MIGHT BE HERE IN 30 SECONDS.\"  Noooooo.  Instead it's \"Oh, okay, I can get you a table right now.\"  GRRRRRR.  I piped up and said, \"Oh, here he is.  We're ready now.\"  The waitress responds, \"I'm going to get her a table, I'll be right back.\"  GRRRR.  I HATE people who say one thing and do another.  I was seeing red at this point, but the place is so danged small I couldn't tell my hubby what I was so pissed off about!!!  Anyhow, the waitress \"that wouldn't seat us\" buzzed our table once or twice, and I asked for water THREE TIMES before a very kind gentleman waiter got it for me.  They forgot my OJ -- he brought it out after I asked the other waitresses TWICE.  Hot sauce?  Never appeared on our table, even after two requests.  Just a tip -- the female waitresses were ditzy as hell.  Ask for a male waiter!!  (sorry if that sounds sexist, but I'm a woman and I know what good service looks like.  This was NOT IT.)  My rating above is based on the FOOD (5 STARS) minus one star for the SERVICE (TWO STARS).  (I know, I know, five minus two is three, but I just couldn't bring the food rating that low, It was THAT GOOD)  In fact, I think I'm heading out now for some of those griddle cakes.  From a male server.  See ya!"}
{"text":"There was a wait, but once you get seated they have quick service. The place is always packed. Venue has amazing food, especially the honey lemonade. It's a life changer! 2 thumbs up for sure!"}
{"text":"so the quest is finally over.  i have found my hangover breakfast spot.  although not hungover on this occasion, i believe that matt's will fit the bill for my greasy big breakfast need after a long night.  came in around 11am, because i can never seem to make it up before 10, and there was no wait and we were greeted and seated right away. started with a coffee which was SO good, some of the best diner/breakfast coffee i have ever had. i went with the salami and egg scramble with hashbrowns and sourdough toast, and my friend went with the chick and hog with bacon and home fries. the food came up pretty fast and i dug in.  fantastic.  the eggs were cooked perfectly and the salami was out of this world. the hashbrowns were a little greasy but i mixed everything together and it balanced out. a little tabasco sauce, and i had one bomb breakfast. i tried my friends bacon and it was phenomenal. crispy, thick, and peppery. delicious. their oj is like drinking straight out of an orange. the toast was great, and their jam was just the right amount of sweet. their portions are HUGE, i couldn't even finish my breakfast. my friend was as impressed as i was. it wasn't overwhelming loud inside like some small joints are known to be (like over easy...) and it wasn't crammed at all, even though the place looks incredibly tiny from the outside!  excellent service, stellar food, cool atmosphere, all for only $20 plus tip. i'm jumping on the matt's bandwagon."}
{"text":"This was a decent meal, expensive and service was iffy but it was an airport location so I think that is to be expected."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, really filling and satisfying. I would've giving this place a 5 star but the manager or whatever he is, the guy up front is some what of an ass. Jason is his name, noticed he is rude to his servers. And definitely had an attitude when my group came in. Not cool sir, not cool!! The servers and other staff was great and attentive."}
{"text":"This is the place other breakfast spots aspire to be. With incredible ingredients, top notch preparation and even better service this is truly a Phoenix gem. Owned and operated by Matt and Ernie, their family atmosphere and attention to detail assure a perfect visit every time. DON'T MISS IT!!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast at this restaurant was over the top. The breakfast sandwich was excellent. I think the key was the sautéed sweet onion and the excellent roll it was made on, gave it a little bit of sweet almost maple syrup flavor. Our server was also excellent I asked for a little more coffee right as the bill came and she filled up a to-go cup for me.  My girlfriend got a Bloody Mary that I am pretty sure could have served as a meal in itself."}
{"text":"This was excellent. Wish I would have taken a picture of my salami scramble with home fries done crispy. Delicious! Highly recommend this place. Cannot wait to visit my son at GCU to have breakfast here. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"For an airport breakfast this restaurant was over the top. The breakfast sandwich was excellent. I think the key was the sautéed sweet onion and the excellent roll it was made on. Our server was also excellent I asked for a little more coffee right as the bill came and she filled up a to-go cup for me.  My girlfriend got a Bloody Mary that I am pretty sure could have served as a meal in itself. And the price wasn't bad for an airport. The breakfast sandwich with potatoes was $10 and too much food for me to finish."}
{"text":"Fun, hippy, eclectic yet completely off the charts kind of place. Been coming here for three years now and the menu items are all to die for. This time I got me an old fashioned, and that drink is very well made here. For my dinner I got the mac and cheese, one of my favorite dishes here. Very creamy, cheesy dish that makes you want more. I also ordered a side of hand cut fries and those were amazing as well. Definitely recommend this place and I'll come back again. Have low expectation for seating and be open minded, you'll have fun."}
{"text":"Holy freaking deliciousness! My boyfriend and I were spending a few days in Phoenix for a mix of work/fun, and he found this place on Yelp. We waltzed in for breakfast around 10am on a Tuesday and were seated immediately. My first observation about this place was the high energy atmosphere, which made me feel really excited to be there. Noise level was moderate - buzzing with conversation but not noisy, making intimate conversation easy. I also got my coffee immediately, and my request for almond milk in place of regular was accommodated. Always a good start :)  After poring over the variety of unique menu options, my boyfriend ordered the Griddlecakes with a side of Thick Cut Bacon and I went for the Salami Scramble. Griddlecakes were pleasantly fluffy but maintained their flavorful density, and the bacon was coated with a sprinkling of peppery goodness. The Salami Scramble was equally enjoyable - thick cut strips of salty/fatty (that's a good thing) meat distributed throughout a helping of scrambled eggs. Ironically, my FAVORITE thing on the table was the side of potatoes that came with my scramble - thick chunks tossed in a perfect medley of sea salt, olive oil and the FRESHEST rosemary. I typically try to shy away from starchy carbs - not for lack of obsession, but out of consideration for my waistline. These potatoes, however, were irresistible. I literally couldn't stop eating them! My boyfriend seemed to share the same sentiment.   If we ever make it back to Phoenix, I would certainly put this Big Matt's location back on my bucket list for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at Matt's and have been to the original downtown location about 11 years ago, the Tempe location, and surprise the airport. I am a creature of habit when I eat out for breakfast. Two eggs over medium , ham, hash browns crispy and dry sourdough. Matts cooks my eggs perfectly, the ham is never salty and the hash browns crispy and brown. I love the sourdough and house smashed strawberry jam. Consistently consistent. Great job to Matt's crew members"}
{"text":"2.5 stars. My cheesy chorizo omelette was very delicious but the homefries included, what seemed like, and entire rosemary plant! It was so overpowering even after spending 5 minutes picking out all that I could. Such a bummer! Service was less than mediocre. Never got a refil or a check-in from our waitress besides when she first brought our drinks over. I think I'll give it one more go and make my final review then!"}
{"text":"This was my first time and with the construction in the area it was hard to find. Once in and seated my eyes wandered, everything that came out looked delicious. I thought it was a little expensive for a traditional egg breakfast but it really was delicious. I would definitely go back and recommend it."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place after reading all the great reviews. I'm here vacationing with my family from Austin, TX and staying in a downtown hotel so this restaurant is walking distance.   The wait was about an hour but I expected it since it seems to be a popular place. The hostess did a great job of keeping everyone in the loop of the status of seating and they even served cold water outside. There are several benches to sit as well as a couple of trees for shade.   After being seated the service was pretty fast. Our drink orders were taken promptly and shortly after was our food order. I ordered the griddlescakes and was quite disappointed. They were very dry and not at all what I expected. My cousin ordered the pork chop and eggs and his pork chops were dry. My husband ordered the pork and chick which was eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast. Everything on his plate was really good. The toast was amazing.   We had to ask to have our drinks refilled a couple of times but they did the best they could given the best they could."}
{"text":"I have no words for this one. Those place, as the name implies, is a breakfast place. That's their emphasis. So why do they have no half- and half for coffee?  All they have is milk. Saying this is a gross oversight would be an understatement."}
{"text":"Great, real and fresh breakfast in a super cute teeny tiny spot.  The space is so small that they don't even have a bathroom and could probably only serve 20-25 people at a time.  We waited about 15 minutes on a Thursday morning, but i would assume the wait could get scary on the weekends.  The food was totally spot on.  From the thick sliced perfectly baked bread they use for toast to the honey lemonade, all the small details take this spot to another level.  I ordered the special scramble which was ham, fresh jalapeno and cheese with a side of hash browns.  Tobin ordered the Hog and Chick (pork chop with eggs) and a side of bacon.  While the entire meal hit the spot, the hash browns were the highlight with a perfect balance of crispy top browned bits to the soft buttery layer underneath. The bacon was also legit, perfectly thick cut and cooked to perfect chewy goodness.  The staff was very friendly, quick and attentive and all seemed to thank us as we as we finished up and walked out.    This place is a definite must see as it is everything restaurants in up-and-coming neighborhoods should be."}
{"text":"I was so excited to be in the area after seeing Matt's Big Breakfast on the Food Channel years ago. I ordered waffles which I will say to my surprise very light and fluffy.  My boyfriend ordered bacon sausage and eggs. Nothing spectacular, a bit over priced my one waffle with no sides was almost $8. I'm glad I tried it but was not overly impressed."}
{"text":"Way overrated very loud not comfortable service was fine food was very expensive not anywhere near the quality that the reviews have done I give it one star"}
{"text":"Usually ALWAYS busy, especially during prime time breakfast hours! Plan ahead and arrive early or after the breakfast rush. Busy and upbeat atmosphere, all food choices get a thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. They're in an airport, and I k JW it's not fast food, but I ordered a waffle. How long does it take to make a waffle. And then they bring me French toast a half hour later. I told them I ordered a waffle and they said it would be a while longer. Can't review the food because I didn't get any.   On top of that when I sat down the counter was wet and dirty. The staff said they'd wipe it down. It took them 15 minutes before they did that. Poor service."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Matt's since it was in the tiny hole in the wall place down the road from it's new location and I have never been let down.  Their menu is fairly small but their portions are gigantic. Just the waffle alone takes up a whole dinner plate, and their omelets are to die for. Literally the first bite always brings a tear to my eye. I always go for the ham, red pepper, and American cheese which just oozes cheese and its innerds with each bite. Their bacon is also soo good, thick cut and well seasoned. They sautee their onions in some delicious oil that I have yet to place but always tastes fantastic. And their lemonade is the perfect mix of sweet and tart, and made fresh daily with real cane sugar and comes with fruit options as well. And each breakfast comes with your choice of bread (sourdough, wheat, white, and occasionally other options) and a side of freshly made jam of the day which is always incredible. I go for their sourdough which is always wonderful but their wheat is just as good.  The only thing I have found lacking is the hash browns, some days they are great but more often than not the bottom half is under cooked and soggy, get the home fries which come with sauteed onions and a sprinkling of fresh rosemary (they are sooo good).  Its family owned and Matt (the owner) gets all of his ingedients fresh from the local farmer's market. It wasnt uncommon in the past to see him helping out tables at the old restaurant but now with the new locations, he's more busy making sure each location is as good as the original.  Parking can be a bit difficult but their is an ally that connects the new restaurant with the old which allows more parking. And their is often a wait if you come before noon, but trust me it is well worth the wait. This is by far the best breakfast joint in town.  I would recommend this place to anyone, whether you just picked up friends or reletives from the airport or if you're just looking for a good hearty breakfast. It can get loud and it is a bit longer wait for large groups (come after 1pm and you won't have a problem) but everyone will thank you for the amazing meal. I seriously suggest this place to everyone I know and everyone says its the best. Whether you stumble in after a long night drinking (they open at 6am and the food is just as good then) or if you're grabbing a bite before starting your day everything here is incredible.   And hey now there's an airport location with a full bar, which I've heard has the best bloody Mary's. The other locations definitely don't match up with the original though so try the place where it all started first."}
{"text":"Good food. Good drinks - they don't skimp on the booze either, full glass of champers for the mimosa and the Bloody Mary is filled with goodies and a lot of vodka! Not quick though, only stop in when their busy if you've got at least an hour to spare."}
{"text":"Man this place is packed but the turn over and service is impeccable. Came here and had a special eggs with chorizo jalapeño and white cheddar yummy!!   My friend had a waffle. It was really rich and good as well. Their bacon is thick and wonderful. Hash browns could have been cooked longer but that's ok.   Overall I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been dying to go here since the last time I was in Phoenix! Nobody does breakfast better. The bacon is delicious. I've only been twice but I love the hog n chick! They have a homemade jelly and their toast is huge. Haven't tried the lemonade yet but I've heard it's good."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here while waiting to board our very delayed flight back home to LA. Initially, it was very crowded and we were told it would be half an hour wait. In their defense, we were flying on 4th of July most of the other restaurants in the airport were closed. But we ended up getting seated within 10 mins.  My only complaint would be that it was a pretty long wait to get our food but when we got it, it was great!"}
{"text":"Located near gate B4 across the US Airways customer service. Daughter loved her Big Butter Burger and wife liked the egg and sausage. I had the pork chops and eggs. Very good. Son didn't like the Mamacita Burger."}
{"text":"Expect to wait for about an hour. The food is ok nothing spectacular. There are too many amazing dining options in downtown phoenix to wait so long here for basic food."}
{"text":"I used to drive and queue to eat at Matt's but not their Biltmore location is right by my house. Consistently great breakfast and attention."}
{"text":"I've had Matt's before and I wasn't impressed because all the meat, but I gave it another try at the advice of a friend and this time was so much better! Plus the wait time at this location was zero on a Saturday morning at 9am! That's pretty much a miracle for MBB!  I am vegetarian for the most part and I'm the only one I know that hates bacon (I know, I know). So after I told our waitress my food restrictions, she suggested the hash w/veggies with an egg on top. YUM! We also had a stack of their pancakes with real maple syrup. They were delicious! The service was great--our very attentive waitress, Michelle, made sure our order and our checks were correct (we were in a group of 7 people and we split checks).  Minus a star because a busser took our pancake plate before we could down the last bites. Maybe they are inexperienced at it and didn't realize they should just ask, \"hey, can i take your plate?\" Other than the over-eager bussers, the staff was nice, chairs and table were comfortable, our waitress was awesome, and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everyone loves this place.  Maybe it's the gigantic portions of meat they serve.  I was not impressed by the veggie section of the menu...oh wait, there's not one...and no, I don't like oatmeal or f-ing grapefruit for breakfast.  ick.  I've waited in line once--that'll be enough for me, Matt."}
{"text":"Michael was the best waiter ever! Early morning flight that was an issues but eatting here and having Michael as our waiter was great. The food was really good but even if it was bad the service was ON POINT. THANK YOU for a wonderful exsperience!"}
{"text":"I only had 36 hours in Phoenix, and wanted to make sure I had the \"Only in Phoenix\" meals.  Everyone told me to go to Matt's (the bartender at Barrio cafe, the concierge, the Uber drivers).  But really, can't you get eggs and bacon anywhere?  I'm from Northern California, and organic is everywhere so I didn't feel this was that special.  But Monday morning, I woke up at 6 am and was starving by the time my lecture was over, and figured Matt's was the closest.  I headed over there and had the best meal in Phoenix.  I had the Monday Special, which was Huevos Rancheros.  Can eggs, tortillas and cheese melt in your mouth?  First time it did for me.  Also, I could just eat their strawberry preserves for breakfast.  Next time, I'm bringing ice packs to bring that jam on the plane!"}
{"text":"came here for our last breakfast before I got sick on vacation (isn't that great) anyway it was delicious and I was happy to have fresh chocolate milk compared to the out of the bottle at other places. my husband loved his food (can't remember what he got) I wasn't a fan of the home fries but I didn't realize what they were cooked in. should have got the hash browns. no wait when we went and it's definitely a local kind of place which is exactly what I wanted."}
{"text":"Yeah...........What everyone else said.........Food is great.  Restaurant is small.  Line is long.  Service is great.    If they delivered this would be the world's best breakfast place.  Even if they had take out.  But delivery?  That would be fantastic.  I could totally picture myself hung over eating a hog and chick in bed."}
{"text":"Should be greeted with a smile no matter how busy. We were greeted, instead, by a rude host who was clearly showing stress over the long  lines and people waiting to be seated. Attitude is everything. Would NOT recommend this restaurant unless you want to start out with a stomachache even before you take one bite of food. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and the food and staff are phenomenal. Great prices. They really thought about every aspect of a great breakfast place and then went above that."}
{"text":"I'm quite impressed.  Very clever business model -- they work extremely efficiently, given what little space they have.  Despite how many people are always in line here, the wait is fairly reasonable.  They have you check-in when you first arrive, and they'll do periodic spot-checks to see who is still here and who just returned from a neighborhood walk.  With that comes wonderful service -- the staff seem genuinely happy to be there.  Service with a smile, really, and they were running about the organized chaos.  I never saw any one staff member stand in one place for more than a few seconds, which is nice because it shows dedication to the business.  I ordered the salami scramble with potatoes and sourdough toast.  I honestly think the best part of my meal was the toast -- crispy on the outside and soft in the center, serviced with some delicious strawberry jam (but it was fresh and tangy and flavorful!).  I think I would have been crazier about the jam, but I'm weird and not huge on jam.  I wish they had the option of butter instead.  Anyway, the salami was almost too rich for me, but it paired well with the eggs, which were nice and fluffy.  I also enjoyed the potatoes, though I thought they were a bit heavy on the rosemary, which actually surprises me because I like my food heavily seasoned.  I had a bit of my fiance's chicken artichoke sausage, which was part of the special, and that was divine.  The orange juice tasted like an orange in a glass.    A little pricey, but considering the quality of the ingredients you get (organic and local), I understand the markup.    Personally, the atmosphere isn't for me -- it's loud and clanky, but that's just my preference.  Doesn't mean it's not a good restaurant or business.  I just like it when I can have a conversation without raising my voice.  Great place, though!  Definitely a place worth checking out."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  I have been hearing about this restaurant for YEARS and was really disappointed.  While the quality of the food was exceptional, the dining experience was marginal.  Difficult to hear, too much traffic, too small of a location.  Clearly, this is an acquired taste by a loyal group of patrons.  Glad they use cage-free eggs!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Very clean. Great food, great service. Classic breakfast with a new age twist."}
{"text":"Amazing place. I've only been here once and I always recommend it to people. I STILL drool over the coffee creamer. No joke probably the best I've ever had. Coming back here shortly!"}
{"text":"Last Sunday I was excited to finally try Matt's Big Breakfast. I walked in through what I thought was the front door and stood there feeling dumb for a few minutes before a woman walked up and asked if I was eating. I responded with yes and she proceeded to that there was a huge wait and stared at me waiting for my response. When I didn't offer one she reiterated \"like a really long wait. Like 40 minutes\" and waited agin for a response so I said okay. She responded again \"like at least 10 people ahead of you.\" And again I said okay. At this point I was frustrated. She let out a sigh and said \"okay well to check in with the hostess\" and walked off without even pointing me in the right direction. I walked around for a minute or two but I couldn't find the hostess and was so upset I just left. I will be going to the Phoenix location to finally try Matt's Big Breakfast, which is upsetting since I work right next to this one."}
{"text":"First timer here. Came around 12:00PM to avoid the anticipated lines.  There were no lines :)  Ordered the Waffle, which was delicious. It was Belgian style but also had fluff to it. Ordered toast and their homemade preserves and that was excellent as well. Probably one of the best waffles I've had in some times. The waffle also came with bacon, which was thick cut and tasted excellent. I'll be back!  5 stars for customer service 4 stars for their food quality  5 stars for their restaurant cleanliness 3 stars for their location (parking building)"}
{"text":"Hearty diner food with good flavors. Nothing extraordinary. Limited menu. Was hoping for an Acai bowl or green drink but that's not this type of place. The real downer was the small dining space which was super noisy and not cozy. Hipster place with a rustic industrial/farm decor. Overhyped but super popular with college crowd.  Friendly service:)"}
{"text":"Sat down. Ordered a cheese omelette. People sat down next to me (2 different parties) and ordered, got their food and ate it before I got mine. One of those parties even cashed out and left before I got mine.  I asked the waiter what happened and he said the chefs get food tunnel-vision and miss orders. I had to take my order to go and bring it on the plane. Super stressful to hope it was going to show up before my plane started boarding. Took over 30mins to get a cheese omelette."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! What a sleeper. I went inside to grab some dinner a kill an hour and a half. Food was outstanding and the services as even better."}
{"text":"The french toast is RIDICULOUSLY delicious.  I love Matt's! Definitely one of my favorite breakfast places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Was told on 3/30/28 at 8:13 am that we could not sit outside (north side was full) on the west side because they wouldn't be able to see us over there.  Great weather and had to sit inside. Come on MBB you're better than that."}
{"text":"Have always wanted to hit this place in Phoenix.... wait, now they are in the Terminal at Sky Harbor Airport... baaam hellllooo layover.  Food was solid, had a name your omelet with sausage, veggies and some queso.  Potatoes had incredibly flavor with the seasonings and little extra they throw in there.  Service was great, my coffee cup was always full.  Definitely the right spot when stuck in Sky Harbor which seems to be EVERY time lately while they work on the runway."}
{"text":"Big. Awesome. Delicious.  Stopped in here for breakfast one morning while in Phoenix.  My other half had the blackboard special of Chorizo Sausage and Jalapeno Omelet with potatoes and a flour tortilla. It was big, awesome  and delicious. It was so big, she couldn't finish it.  I had the stack of pancakes with a side of sunnyside up eggs and ham off the bone. It was big, awesome and delicious. And I finished it all off because I'm a gavone.  Service was attentive. Whenever you need a coffee refill, BAM, it was refilled. Nice.  The only thing that was odd, to me anyway, was that the pancakes came served on a hot plate (Ruth Chris Steakhouse style) and the maple syrup was also heated up.  Other than that, breakfast was Big. Awesome. And Delicious."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was welcoming and food was good. But the servers dress was inappropriate for a breakfast place if I wanted to see that much skin I would have gone to Hooters at least there they don't look like they just got out of bed."}
{"text":"I so love this breakfast place! This is right by downtown ASU so I always go there when I was in school. Coming back almost 2.5 years later, it hasn't changed a bit. It was still so busy but charming!   In general, everything here is good. They have different specials for each day so I always like to get that. However, this time I got the salami hash and hash brown. It was seriously so bomb! They use organic eggs and just organic everything. Food definitely taste fresh. I brought my boyfriend here to try my favorite breakfast place and he had no complaints either! He ordered a traditional breakfast plate and it came with eggs, sausage, hash browns, bacon, and toast. Oh my gosh, this hash brown is the best I have ever had. I almost forgot how good it tasted before going back this time! It was so crispy and not oily at all. I also want to rave about the toast here! It was just on point! I usually don't like toast but this one I could not pass."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place, decor, service, food, all get 5 stars. Simple, high quality ingredients cooked perfectly always make for a great experience in my book. Had the Nieman ranch beef burger and it was out of control. Gotta go back to try the namesake Breakfast!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday for lunch with a couple of friends, and am so glad we did! Fortunately, we did not have to wait at all and got seated right away! I ordered the freshly squeezed honey lemonade and waffle with bacon. When I drank the lemonade, I thought it was good..but more honey than lemon than I wished. Now...I'm craving for one.   Our food came surprisingly fast given how busy it was. I chowed down and cleaned up the entire plate very fast...the waffle was crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside, and the bacon was thick and yummy. Yum yum yum.   I tried my friend's potatoes and wheat toast with jam, it was so good! I'm a PB without J kind of person...and I really liked the jam. My bill was like $14 total..I would totally go back again for the food."}
{"text":"Ask your server what's good. I'll give you a hint, *ANYTHING* with the word  \"salad\" in it is a dud. Not because I don't like salad, I LOVE salads! But the fancy salad, tossed \"cobb\" salad, egg salad sandwich, tuna salad sandwich, and macaroni salad are all VERY bland. Trust me on this one. And the tomato soup tastes like maranara sauce, but is super good for dipping the awesome grilled cheese into. Tomato soup by itself....meh. Plus....it's $7 DOLLARS for one bowl of tomato soup. No. Everything else is well worth the money. If you have any issues with your food ever, just let your server know (nicely) and they'll gladly fix it for you, seriously. Also...they don't carry ranch. WHAT!?!?! In America?????? Lame. But all their food is seriously thebomb. com, and I suggest you get with your server to help you choose. they're usually WAY busy,  but most of the time very friendly and willing to give you an honest opinion.   Personally, I recommend the Sweet N Savory french toast. WOW. And that applewood smoked pork sausage???? WWWWOWWWW"}
{"text":"The first time I came here (their old location) I sat outside and waited for an hour and a half in the pouring rain. I had biked over, so I literally had nowhere indoors to sit and wait.  Although I was hangry (adjective: angry from hunger), soaking wet and slightly impatient (this was back before they offered wait times), it was worth it.  Matt's hash browns are perfectly crisp and golden. The eggs are rich and delicious, unlike the ones you find in chain grocery stores. The coffee (from a local roaster) is clean, fresh and bright. Their 5 Spot sandwich is a perfect sampling of all their delicious breakfast offerings, and the simple Hog n Chick is a fresh, local take on a classic egg and ham breakfast.  I would recommend Matt's Big Breakfast to absolutely everyone.  Tip: If you don't want to wait for half an hour to 45 minutes, come between 7:45 and 8:15 nearly any morning of the week. The wait will be ~5 minutes, and you'll be leaving just as people begin to pile up!"}
{"text":"This place is an institution in downtown Phoenix! And for good reason - great food cooked just the way you want it and lots of it. Every time I am downtown I want to eat here."}
{"text":"I tried the Special of the Day which was Ham,Cheese Chile Omelet with the home fries. My Husband tried the Sausage patties  and Eggs with home fries. These dishes were very good. The server was very attentive plus there was no waiting in line to get seated. The food was served very promptly while it was still steaming hot. Will definitely return to eat here on our next trip to Phoenix.."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Hadn't been to the new location until today.  Love the size of the new location.  You don't feel like a scumbag if you want to sit and talk for a bit since there is room for others to sit.  The food is excellent as usual.  Today it was the omelet with provolone, mushrooms, and sausage.  The sourdough toast was thick, crunchy outside with a chewy inside.  And the hashbrowns were just the way I like them - crunchy, but not too crunchy.  The service is attentive even when it's busy.  A must visit if you're downtown for breakfast or dinner."}
{"text":"meh. i've experienced better."}
{"text":"I am seriously shocked at any good review for this restaurant. I ate breakfast here this morning, and it was the worst breakfast I've had... Maybe ever? The home fries that some people rave about were soggy, greasy and heavily over flavored with rosemary, not to mention Luke warm. The bacon was inedible salty. The toast came out with enough butter for a whole loaf of bread. The over easy eggs were actually fine, thus one star. The waitress never asked why I left all of my home fries uneaten, not a sign of good service. Expensive and NOT worth it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great breakfast spot and don't mind a bit of a wait, Matt's is an excellent choice. The building is pretty small, so there are not many tables, meaning you could be waiting awhile. The food is definitely worth the wait though! I tend to get the pancakes, they are huge and delicious. I always get a cup of coffee, and it is always a good idea. This last time one of my friend's got the chili, and she said it was terrific. I love going to Matt's on Sundays for an after-church brunch, and I would say if you're on that side of town when it's open, go in and get some good food."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I love it even more now that they moved to a significantly larger location.  Everything I have ever eaten there has been scrumptious.  My only regret when I go here is that I cannot fit more of the deliciousness into my belly!"}
{"text":"Super cute place to get brunch! We ate at the Camelback location. I saw this place featured in the Phoenix magazine and was excited to try it. It was very busy, we were told a 50 minute wait but only waited 30 so that was nice.  I had the cheese omelette with breakfast potatoes. I added mushrooms - it was excellent and the portions are big. I could've eaten five plates of the breakfast potatoes. My boyfriend got the pancakes and loved them, said they were very filling.   The service is great. Our coffee mugs were never empty. Everyone is your waiter/waitress so you can ask whomever to help you. They were all friendly and efficient.   The only reason Matts doesn't get 5 stars for me is because the seating was so uncomfortable. We sat at a high top and the stools are hard metal squares. Maybe I have a big ass but it was not enough room and definitely not conducive to wearing a dress. Space is also cramped.   If you can avoid the high top seating, I highly recommend Matts!"}
{"text":"Not sure why all the hype. Food was extremely average. Couldn't get a crunchy breakfast bread to go with. Eggs weren't hot. Bacon not crunchy either. Wait staff not interested in making it a great experience. Just overall.. meh."}
{"text":"This is a chain breakfast spot that serves breakfast foods all day. This location is in the airport. You can order at the counter and get it to-go or sit-down with waiter service. This place has bar seating as well. I tried the $13 chili cheese burger and the $9 breakfast burrito served with chorizo. You could choose sausage or bacon instead of chorizo. The burger was huge and came with a side of French fries. My bf thought they didn't give enough fries. The burrito came with a side of pico de gallo. It wasn't enough so I asked for a 2nd but I think 3 would have been enough for me. I liked the burrito more than the burger. It was surprisingly super spicy. The burger had an awesome fluffy bun but a very thin piece of meat and some drier chunks of ground beef in the chili. The chili was more just ground beef and some beans than a chili. It wasn't very wet at all. The shredded cheese inside wasn't really melted. The water they gave tasted like there was a bit of lime. It had a metal flavor to me. I like the interior decor (had a giant pig on the wall and large bench-style seats with long round leather pillows) and music playlist (indie music). Their downtown location was featured on the TV show Diners, Drive-ins and Dives."}
{"text":"The service is always horrible. The 2 stars are for the food. There are restaurant with better service and food  in Sky Harbor if you don't have a lot of time pass this one by!"}
{"text":"Have also review this place under it's former address just down the street - but have only eaten at this particular location.  Went in for lunch last Tuesday but got breakfast. Still was pretty busy but managed to get a parking spot in their tiny lot behind rather than pay a metre. Inside, we were almost immediately offered the bar area but, after sitting, found the seats are polished steel and I kept sliding off. They are not made for larger customers and some cushions with traction would not go amiss. So, we waited an extra 10 minutes for a table.  Got a large Belgian-style waffle with butter and syrup and the daily special lemonaide (strawberry honey). The lemonade was tasty and the waffle was delicious, but honestly a little costly for the amount of food. I definitely should have gone with the omelette - which is the same price but you get a huge omelette and a side of bacon and home fries! The waffle - which also comes with excellent thick-cut sliced bacon - definitely needs to come with a side of potatoes. A side of potatoes ordered on it's own is over $2.  However, service is super friendly and attentive. Still recommend this place but if you're hungry, skip the waffle and get something more generous!"}
{"text":"While waiting to be seated I was acosted by an agressive panhandler :(  That being said we had coffee while we waited. On to the food...everyone in our party thought it was great...had the Hog & Chick myself.  The menu prices have gone up from what I saw on-line though...need to update their website!  Ernie (Matt's wife) helped us and was very nice. Overall was worth the wait...about 30 minutes on a Saturday morning.  There is a Farmer's Market across the street that you can check out while waiting :)"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the service is always friendly.  I came here today with a large group of 45 and the staff bent over backwards to accommodate us all.  We were alll in and out within 60 minutes and the Reuben was delicious as always."}
{"text":"So much no.    We decided on this place without much research. Big mistake.    The location is quite beautiful, in the Marina Heights district.  It's nestled in the midst of large high rises, near the water. There is a swanky gym nearby with lots of that foot traffic about.  Matt's appeared to have a wait as there were quite a few people waiting outside.    We were a party of 2 and waited about 15 mins to be seated.  That wasn't bad, but WHERE we were seated was HORRIBLE. It was a tiny little table in what felt like the middle of the lobby.  It was the first table right inside the door so everyone waiting is in your face staring and the constant door swinging made it quite chilly. Yuck!   I opened the menu and was greeted by a lack of choices.  Super disappointing. So the menu was disappointing, I hated were we were seated and then the really nice server brings us water and iced tea in these TINY glasses.  That was enough for me.  We left.    Now we are at The Oink instead, about 10 mins away and MUCH MUCH happier."}
{"text":"This place is always busy -takes a while to get a table but the service is always great and their food is great. I love this place from brunch."}
{"text":"Terrible place.  Bacon and potatoes are covered in pepper.  Eggs over easy were raw and cold.  Toast was cold."}
{"text":"Every time we come here, we were very pleased with its tasty breakfast and brunch. It was always packed with people and bit loud. This might not be the best place to have conversation but the food never betray you. The place has a good vibe and they seem to know how to manage the restaurant. besides the main dishes, try a cup of coffee, it goes well with your meal."}
{"text":"This place is so bomb. It was Sunday so tried the steak and eggs special. Loved how the potatoes came with caramelized onions and rosemary. Eggs were cooked right and steak was good. Added a side of pancakes and was delicious. Definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Love that they have Four Peaks beer on tap, including my favorite, Hop Knot. But I'm wishing I had made a different food choice. l ordered the grilled cheese with creamy tomato soup. Because I figured it was impossible to go wrong with a comfort food staple and I'm tired of burgers at the airport. I must have had a shocked look when my food arrived. The tomato soup was no where near creamy, but a chunky-ish tomato soup with no cream. The grilled cheese was no where near the gourmet sandwich the menu promised. So not worth $10. Should have gone to NYPD pizza instead."}
{"text":"The food was as good as the original downtown location.  Service was solid.  This location is trendy and much larger than the other locations.  I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Airport location is not as good as the location downtown.    They get really busy here and often have a 15-20+ minute wait.  From this experience I will not return to the airport location again."}
{"text":"Fathers Day breakfast at our favorite breakfast spot.  Food is exceptional here, staff was spot on and they are very consistent in the kitchen.   Wish they'd open up their patio more.  This morning would have been perfect outside!"}
{"text":"If you're at all a \"Foodie\" you can't come to Phoenix, or anywhere within 50 miles and not visit Matt's Big Breakfast.  The wait outside is just part of the ambiance and culture of this tiny little place.  I hope they don't very enlarge this place....it would so spoil it.  Food....have anything.  Its all cooked to perfection with love and kindness from a kitchen staff that really cares about freshness.  My personal fav's are the Waffle and Bacon and the multi grain toast with the fresh jam typically made locally....changes frequently.   This was on Diner, Drive-ins and Dives a few years ago and its still the same bustling place as when Guy was there.  Side note...this was way cool.  On our last visit there were 4 of us, and if you've been here you know there are only a couple of tables that seat 4.  So we're waiting outside when the server comes out hands us menus, takes our orders.  When we're seated about 15 min. later our food was delivered within minutes of being seated.  Helped us get in and out and helped them move a table.  Much appreciated service."}
{"text":"Great fresh food. Have been there dozen times or so wait can be long but its worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place was out of this world, great staff and friendly. Chicken apple Gouda with cage free eggs and spinach was delish and OMG the home fries were outta this world. Nice tasty thick sliced wheat toast and homemade strawberry jelly to compliment the meal was one experience I will never forget. Matts Big Breakfast is a must to visit again when in the 602 area."}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience with the location on Phoenix, but I have not enjoyed my visit to this location once. The first time I got a breakfast burrito, and while it was good, there were so many jalapeños on it I almost got sick. The second time I ordered a burrito with no jalapeños, but they were still included on my burrito. The service at the to go counter isn't great, if you're going to eat here take the time to sit down for a meal."}
{"text":"OMG! Our favorite place to go anytime we are in Phoenix! Rode the light rail all the way across town to make it there before heading to the airport! The absolute best customer service we received at any restaurant while on vacation including an expensive spot in Sedona! Food is always top notch quality and best ingredients like sweet cream butter and real maple syrup. Love love love Matts!!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, a huge and sincere thanks to William and the entire staff of Matt's Big Breakfast. Your hospitality and generosity opened the door to visit you all week during our stay in Phoenix. I have always had a tendency to support local restaurants and the quality/engaged service you provided made our group feel comfortable.   The items that I order included were the amazing & fresh pancakes (Monday), Waffles (Tuesday) & Bacon, French Toast (Wednesday), Chops & Potatoes (Thursday) and Waffles & Bacon (Friday). I can honestly say that I did not have a favorite breakfast.... they were all amazing in their own right. Fresh thick bacon and divine rosemary potatoes were amazing and the strawberry honey lemonade made my time away from home worthwhile.   By the way, I am still shaking my head at the separate check/separate payment method confrontation that occurred between my collague and your owner on the final day of our stay yet since I am choosing to leave it to it being a simple miscommunication, I am rating you on the entirety of the visit.  Thank you again for doing such a fantastic job!"}
{"text":"To the man sporting the mun on 4/28/18 at noon seating people. Do you realize that your job is a people job? When I asked you how long the wait was you rudely answered, \" there are 3 parties ahead of you.\" I gave you the opportunity to redeem yourself or to realize you hadn't answered my question. When your response was equally brusque and you again didn't have the courtesy to look at me you weren't only rude, but you minimized a customer, not once but twice. Had I not been with other people I'd have left. Maybe you don't need my business so screw you, too. I won't return.  Not to any of your locations. People like you forget that yelp is our voice. Keep forgetting.  BTW, the Cobb salad? Wasn't fresh."}
{"text":"I hit the MBB every time I'm at sky harbor airport and it's amazing!!! They can turn tables fast and the food is always consistent."}
{"text":"Horrendously slow!  It's an airport, if you're this slow, you're no good.  Worse yet, I'm just talking about the to go line!  To go, to them, gets no preference.    On top of that, they give the wrong food.  Given their before mentioned slowness, after receiving my food, I had to get on the plane, only to then discover, instead of oatmeal, they gave me an egg, bacon and cheese sandwich with potatoes.  While I'm sure it was tasty (maybe), it most certainly is not in my eating habit.  So, there I am on a 3 hour morning flight with the choice of either going hungry or eating some crap that's going to make me feel sluggish and bad all day.  I chose hunger."}
{"text":"It was a step up from a typical breakfast plate but still very good! The pancake was very good. I recommend if you aren't looking for lots of options since it has a very simple menu."}
{"text":"Breakfast is always good here, but tonight I tried the BLT with fries.  Lots of crisp, thick bacon on toasted bread.  Fries were also good, and the service excellent.  Spend the extra for the orange juice."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast place, well worth the wait!!  We were really happy with our meals.  I had the Egg, spinach and fontina scramble special (out of this world)  Coffee and water never went empty as they continually refilled...  Definitely a must go to when you are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My husband had been buggin me to go.... always at least an hour wait, so I went with my sister who was visiting on vaca form LA.   only 25 minutes outside on a midweek morning about 930 ....  weather was good so that part was fine.... I had the special, which was a pork loin benedict, and she had the hog and chick (ham and eggs).  I ordered the wrong thing for sure.    the server recommended the hashbrowns, but my husband said home fries (of course via text, after I had ordered).   the hashbrowns were DROWNED in butter.   Not a bad thing but a heart attack waiting to happen, for real.   service was great, they churned and burned us and got us in and out.   But not sure what the hype is about.  its close, but not cheap as far as diners go, so in my mind I think i would have rather just eaten at home.   so 3 stars, for locally grown food, good service, and a little pricey."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to go to the old Matt's location pretty often. We loved the food but we got sick of the wait times and stopped going. We decided to give the new spot a try and I'm so glad we did! We arrived around 9 on a Sunday, ready to wait. But although the restaurant was full our wait was not long at all! Less than 20 minutes maybe? Although it could be because we were willing to sit at the counter. Whatever, we were happy!  We settled in and opened our menus happy to see old familiar favorites. I ordered the waffle with bacon and my boyfriend got the pancakes. They were every bit as good as we remembered. Huge portions and full of flavor. The pancakes and waffle have almost a sweet flavor to them but they're not sugary. Just right. The bacon is my favorite thing though. Thick, peppery, bacon-y goodness. I'd say it's the best bacon in town.   I'm so happy to have rediscovered Matt's. It's sure to become a regular choice for us once again."}
{"text":"Matts feels like home. The tables remind me of snack time in Grandma's kitchen, the salt and pepper shakers remind me of the ones that sat on my neighbor's counter in her collections.... even the slightly wobbly leg of the chair reminds me of my college apartment furnished with family castaways and thrift shop treasures.   REAL food comes from a place that feels so much like home... by real, i mean... real eggs, real butter, real sausage....   Food at Matt's is pure and innocent... Pancakes with butter. Eggs with potatoes and bacon. Classic.   yum."}
{"text":"If you enjoy fruit flies swarming around your beverage, having your meal given to the table next to you (and eaten before they discovered the problem), slow service, then THIS is YOUR place!  Hopefully I Will not get sick from the flies in my beverage!!!   Guess I will need to wait for the next 48 to 72 hours to see if I get sick.   I expect this in a foreign country or open air restaurant but not at an airport!"}
{"text":"Hi all! Went to Matt's last night for the PJ's and Eggs! Matt was great a bunch of the guys from Hickman farms were there having breakfast too! The special was steak and eggs, while I originally had my little heart set on a butter burger I had to try the Steak and eggs. I was not disappointed it was fantastic! Just as I suspected. I think I am becoming a Matt's groupie! lol. I can't help it between the cozy atmosphere, the friendly staff, fresh delicious menu choices and given that I am supporting a family business I am hooked! Now I will say last night we waited about an hour and there were 5 of us but all agreed it was so worth the wait. PS I had to get a butter burger to go I had it for lunch today YUM! Thanks Erenia and Matt!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, the lemonade was AMAZING, the service was the worst I've ever had. I know it's a serious allegation to make, but I think the staff I encountered on the day I went there with my girlfriend were likely racist. I'm not saying they were for sure, but to me it was strange that the waitress wouldn't make eye contact with my girlfriend, much less even look in her direction. In fact, I had to order for her because she blatantly ignored her. I even tried flagging a different waitress down and was met with the same behavior. I'm the first to admit if I'm being a D-Bag or rude but all we did was sit down, place our order, and eat so I can't think of any other reason why we were treated this way. We eat out a lot and were from out of town so I think our table I side manners were fine. I don't want to say this incident is representative of the staff in the restaraunt as a whole but it was definitely an unpleasant experience and I will never go back when I go back to Phoenix and I will recommend people against it when they decide to go too given it's a fairly popular restaurant. Sourness aside, the food was decent; a little cold and the honey lemonade was to die for. I've tried making it at home to no success. To bad this place is mediocre and is staffed with mediocre quality people otherwise I'd go back every time I go down to Phoenix."}
{"text":"We went early, 8am on a Sunday for breakfast.  There was a 5 minute wait (although they don't quote wait times), and we sat at the bar counter.  The coffee was delicious, as was the daily lemonade.  We ordered an egg special with country sausage patties, homefries, and toast.  My husband is a huge sausage fan, and he thought it was very good.  The bacon was delish, and the pancakes were simply but fluffy and flavorful.  We will be back, but we will go early because by the time we left, there was a very lengthy wait."}
{"text":"Good service. Good pancakes and the home fries / rosemary potatoes are great.   Got us seated and food came out fast.   One warning: the children's options are HUGE. Share with kids and save the waste."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad for an airport restaurant. Service is HORRIBLE!  No teamwork, tons of servers, but no structure, people grouped up talking, I would say it's horribly managed..... waited 30 minutes for a BLT with chips. Never once checked on my drinks or came by to inform me of the hold up. Do yourself a favor and keep walking......"}
{"text":"Great Food, cool spot, great coffee... What else do you need? The thick cut bacon was amazing!"}
{"text":"I love places like this.  Had the hog and chick: eggs over easy, thick cut bacon (you always know a good spot if their bacon is legit), hash browns and homemade sourdough toast. Totally solid and cheap."}
{"text":"Dive side of town but a really dynamic local diner. Short hours and a small footprint make it a tough call, but it's worth the visit. We arrived early, 15 minutes after opening and there was already a 30+ min wait on a Saturday morning.    Good diner-quality breakfast with quick service, good hot cakes, eggs & potatoes. Cheap and a giant meal on a large plate. The place was full of locals; we were the only out-of-state license plate on the street."}
{"text":"I never ordered a scramble at a breakfast place before in my life. Matt's Big Breakfast changed that. I decided to order the Saturday special and it included a scramble of jalapenos, bacon and  cheese with a side of country potatoes. The tortilla that also came with it was like the icing on the cake. I enjoyed every part of the breakfast including the rosemary country potatoes. I couldn't have had a better scramble experience and I recommend coming to this place 10 times out of 10. Yes, the line may be long but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The Hash browns are an amazing butter-delivery system. The bacon was thick and wonderful, and everything was spot-on delicious. It was worth the 40 minute wait, but I wish they would have more outdoor seating for when you're waiting."}
{"text":"I visited Phoenix this past weekend and Matt's Big Breakfast was our first stop upon arrival. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this place but I was pretty impressed! The menu is small and consists of your basic eggs/meat/potato dishes, scrambles, and waffles. I ordered the Hog & Chick - 2 eggs, potatoes, your choice of bacon/sausage, and bread. My favorite part of the dish was the house potatoes - crispy and infused with rosemary... so good! I also really liked the sourdough bread, although it is heavy as it's covered in butter. Prices are low. Service was great.   We got there around 1:30pm on a Saturday and there was no wait."}
{"text":"We just landed from kc, we were hungry and wet from the rain.  A 20 minute wait and a good table, my birthday got brighter.  The bacon was extra crispy and the orange juice had bits of real orange.  Service was quick and organized.  The place is small, but clean & bright.  If you are ever there when they have the three meat scramble with eggs, spicy peppers & cheese- get it!  My partner ordered this & I had food envy."}
{"text":"This place is absolute heaven when you are hungover.  The omelets are huge and fluffy, stuffed with deliciousness.  I love the thick cut bacon!  They definitely do not skimp on the good stuff!  I was talking about it with a guy at The Roosevelt later that night and he told me Matt drives out to Gilbert once a week for that bacon.  Definitely worth it!  The hash browns are even better.  Perfectly crispy without being burned.  Matt's will definitely fill you up at a very good price.  Loved seeing Matt at The Roosevelt that night!  He's awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped in Saturday morning, early enough to beat the crowds. (After 7.30ish, fuggetabouit....). Ordered Hog (sausage patties) and Chick, but really didn't want hashbrowns. No subs tough, so got a single pancake side. Sadly, I must say it was only an average breakfast. Eggs OM as requested, and sausage good, but almost too spicy, overpowering the pork. The hashbrowns are a waste though, like an afterthought to fill the plate. Almost burned, raw in the middle. Easy enough issue to fix though. Matt should bump up the quality control to keep the place hoppin'. No big worries though, I'll be comin' back!"}
{"text":"When people say Matt's is small, they're right.  I think there are maybe 8 tables and some stools up at the bar and that's about it.   Also, don't expect to walk right in & grab a seat.  Popular spot + tiny place = waiting (we waited about 45 minutes for a table for 2).  Thankfully, it was a pretty nice day, though there isn't a whole heckuva lot to explore in the area.  Plusses:   -They serve RC cola!  Fun times.  I haven't had an RC since I was a kid. -Their waffle is really good.   Light, sweet, buttery deliciousness.   -Small place = intimate setting.  It's a good place for conversation, at least in a small group setting.  Minuses:  -The place, and my silverware, weren't especially clean.  Having a knife that's gunky doesn't make me want to eat. -The bacon was underdone.  I like chewy bacon, but mine was almost oinking.  I'll take a steak medium-rare, but please not the bacon. -The aforementioned RC cola gets served to you in can form.   All-in-all, the food was pretty good, but not a place I'd wait outside for 45 minutes for.    3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Came to town for some training and wanted to try this place out. Not just because it was on Triple D but it got great reviews on Yelp too. I had The Five Spot with a side of homefries. The food was excellent, has to be the best breakfast sammich ever. The homefries are really good too, but the sammich was the best. Definitely worth checking out. I went on a Monday around 1 pm and the place was pretty full, but no wait. Its good enough to wait for though."}
{"text":"My husband came to my work to have lunch with me the other day and being how all I hear about in this area is Matt's, I decided we would go try it. So we pulled up outside and found a parking spot, WOOHOO!! (there seemed to be limited spaces unless you want to meter it) I looked at the outside and was again scared of the size (I really do have claustrophobia) but decided I was going in! It was VERY small but we got a table in the \"back room\" which cracked me up because there is this really small step to get to it and all the workers' kept saying \"watch your step\", it was just really funny.   So, I had the cheese omelet and home potatoes with bacon. It was delicious! My husband had the salami and egg scramble with hash browns and LOVED it! This is our new favorite breakfast spot! The only bad thing was the restroom which has been mentioned in other reviews, it's next door at the motel which is not so desirable so go to the bathroom before you go to Matt's and everything should be fine. The service was excellent and I will definitely be back, oh and no wait! It must have been my lucky day!!"}
{"text":"Not as good as it once was. The food is good and the service is nice and friendly but I think the food is not as good as it once was.  I use to love fighting the crowds to eat here.  I still like the place but I have had better in the past."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast.  Fresh home style cooking.  Not frozen and reheat like what would be expected from an Airport eatery.  If you're hungry and looking for good food Matt's is the place."}
{"text":"I'd been waiting for the perfect time to experience Matt's.  This Wednesday morning I felt like that time had come.  I figured Wednesday at 11am shouldn't have much of a wait.  It didn't, and we were seated within 10-15 minutes.  The place is cute and the service is really great once you get seated (until then everyone looks kinda rushed and annoyed by you).    Our experience had it's high points: *Our extremely sweet server (love those glasses) *The ridiculously good coffee *and the novelty of eating in a shoe box.  I got the Hog and Chick with Bacon.  It was yummy, but...gasp....nothing to wait an hour and a half for like most people do on the weekends.  Yes the bacon was thick cut, and the preserves for the toast were lovely, but still, I actually had a hard time picking something off of the menu because nothing seemed to jump out at me as unique or unmissable.   One thing's for sure though, they do the classics well. For me, the above high points are enough to bring me back again, and hopefully next time the special will rock my socks off.    Matt and Ernie have a great group of concepts, thanks for bringing downtown up a notch."}
{"text":"This place is always so hard to get into on the weekends for good reason. Delicious, homemade breakfasts with prompt, friendly service. Couldn't ask for more! I ordered their Friday special, which happened to be chorizo, Jack, jalapeño, and a tortilla. Would drive all the way back downtown from Peoria for that again."}
{"text":"Stopped by near the end of their day as it was convenient and didn't know what to expect. The servers were excellent though they must have been getting geared to shut down. It was late enough we had no wait at all and our server encouraged us to take our time ordering and enjoying the meal. I wasn't super hungry, but I tried the special (three egg skillet with peppers and other goodness) and it was amazing. I will definitely be back next time I am downtown in the morning."}
{"text":"Matt's is pretty good breakfast. I am glad that when I went we had no wait whatsoever. Not sure how we pulled that off on a beautiful Sunday morning...happy though!  Definitely overrated. No question there. However there is a certain extreme eating quality to eating at a place smaller than my living room with other guests. I might go back if i spy the line is nonexistent, otherwise...there are other places down the block that are better and you can walk right in and eat!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Come here every time I am in Phoenix. The food is incredibly fresh and everyone who works here is very friendly. Usually a wait, but completely worth it. My only complaint is that their daily specials aren't full time on the menu, especially the Eggs Benedict (which is only offered on Thursday's). Their hollandaise sauce is made from scratch and out of this world!"}
{"text":"Big. Big might be a bit of an understatement when describing this place. The portions are HUGE. I ordered the 3 egg omelette with salami, which also came with hash browns and toast. The 3 eggs was more like 4. Half the plate was eggs/salami, the other half was hash browns. Then she brought the toast out, with a homemade jam. Then I had the nerve to order a side of bacon.  *sidenote* the bacon was 3 thick strips sprinkled in pepper. When I bit into that first piece, the amalgamation of pepper, maple and succulent pig meat did a slow sensual tango with my tongue. I immediately looked around to see if anyone else was having this same experience. Yes. I was not the only one. Bacon. Get it. *end sidenote* There was so much food I had to map out a quick strategy. Started with the bacon. (BACON. GET IT) then dove into the eggs which was very good. The hash browns were on point, and the jam was very good.   The only reason I didn't give me a 5 is because of the wait. This is a popular spot, so be prepared to wait about 45 min. The place isn't that big, so we waited out front for just about 45. The wait was def worth it."}
{"text":"We came here when I was 9 months pregnant, that was an excellent choice. The orange juice was great, and so was our food! The pancakes were amazing, I kept stealing them from my husband. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a tasty Bloody on your way out of town for vacation or a Egg White & Spinach omelet before heading off for a business trip, this place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I was super excited about this place opening in tempe! but man am i disappointed. walked in the side entrance i guess because we were not greeted by anyone, no one even looked up, no acknowledgement. we found the host stand and some guy with spiked hair and slippers on asked our name and how many, still no hello or how are you, then didn't even tell us our wait time. pretty confusing on where to wait, i guess their large patio is not in use or something? but no explanation. we were seated in a timely manner. our server didn't really greet us just kinda asked what we wanted. didn't tell us about the specials, also dropped off our drinks with her fingers touching the top rim of the glass, which is a huge no and i'm pretty sure you learn that the first day of server training at any restaurant. food came out quickly and was very good, we had the pancakes. the only reason i'm giving any stars is for the manager? with the slicked back grey hair, thanks for helping  us out and at least saying bye to us! service energy was very low, but his was not. we had to pass 8 or 9 breakfast spots around mill to get to matts big breakfast, we went out of our way to go here when we could've stopped at any of them we passed. service is almost nonexistent."}
{"text":"Awesome food, i ordered Chop and chic.  Lovely food and ambiance, would stop by here again. I have been to pheonix airport so many times but did not happen to be here.  Will recommend for sure."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for Matt's Big Breakfast, but I left unimpressed and really disappointed.  Why only 3 stars? Service, food options and coffee.   Service My sister and I visited at 9am to avoid long waits, and it was perfect the entire restaurant was pretty much empty. With that being said, I expected decent service but nope. Our waitress, Michelle, wasn't very kind and didn't welcome us when she first arrived to our table. She also never once checked on us during our meal. And instead of saying thank you when she dropped off the check, she just put it on our table and walked away. I wish I could've given the tip to the manager, I think his name was David, instead of her. He checked on us AND picked up the dirty dishes.   Coffee Oh my god, the coffee was just terrible. Very bitter, I couldn't even finish half the cup.   Food options Everything has Pig products and you can't substitute anything for those products. We had to say no bacon and pay full price for another side (hash browns). Instead of just switching them out like they do at every other restaurant.   So.. why did I even give them 3 stars instead of 2 or 1? The manager did a great job checking on us, the whole place was spotless, the food was good (especially the strawberry jam) and I feel like being nice.  Would I recommend Matt's Big Breakfast? No way! And I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Seriously good stuff here.  Yes, the lines are long but that's not really their fault.  The food is great and people want to come here.  The waffle here is simply the best.  I've never had better, anywhere.  I've also had the burger, which was really, really, really good.  Next time I'll see if they can put a different cheese on it because I'm not a big fan of American cheese.  Regardless, everything here was delicious, regardless of the line.  If you're willing to wait, or maybe come at an off-hour, it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Its been a while since the hubs and I had been to Matt's.   We woke up on New Years Eve and I knew Matt's had to be our last breakfast of the year.   We got there at about 930 and were 5th in line! Wooooot!   The hubs and I grabbed a spot on one of the benches and had fun watching all the newbs come up. They always walk right past all the people standing outside waiting, past the sign in page and march inside like they own the place. soooo funny.   The food and service is still as great as its ever been! The waffle was sent from heaven and so was the bacon!   Even though our visits have become few and far between due to moving further away, Ernie still knows who we are and keeps teasing us and asking when we are going to have kids, she is like a distant aunt! Love her!   Keep it up Matts!"}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast has been a favorite, must go to spot for my wife and me every time we come to AZ. We sort of miss the original small building as it was so cozy, but the new building provides the same excellent food and great service. Thanks for the continued wonderful experience Ernie!"}
{"text":"The aptly named Big Breakfast isn't the only thing they should be famous for. The food is not only generous, its fresh. The potatoes are home made (nothing processed here) and the bread appears as if its never seen a bag in its life.   They kept the coffee coming!   We didn't wait at ALL on Tuesday at 7AM so if you work downtown, do yourself a favor and hit Matt's before work one day..you'll beat the traffic, the Saturday lines and be so full, you probably won't need much of a lunch.   In short: fresh food, tall coffee, tasty treat. Well worth it. Even with a wait."}
{"text":"No wait to sit at the counter what a mistake. Worst service I ever had. No set no acknowledging I was there ask for coffee twice.  No silverware.  Never got a refill.  Order came out cold  Just a horrible service experience. And the restaurant was only two thirds full.  If you need to be ignored and eat overpriced even by airport standards cold food. Served by staff that should not be dealing with the public then eat here."}
{"text":"The food is awful!! Very few choices. I ordered the cheesy omelet with mushrooms and saugage. Which I had to pay 2 extra dollars for. Barely any mushrooms or saugage just all cheese. Don't get me wrong love cheese but it was gross. The hash browns were disgusting and were actually the color grey. The only good thing was the side of toast which is the only thing I could eat."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good. Staff was great. Wait was long, if your really hungry bring a snack.. we ran errands while waiting. I would go again with people who haven't been, but mostly for the novelty of experiencing breakfast that you have to wait an hour for.."}
{"text":"In a word...Magical.  The best breakfast you'll ever have.  Homemade breads, sausage (cherry & bourbon was the special one day)...   Ate breakfast everyday of our trip.  Had heard about it from DDD and after all these years business sent us out there.  You know when you work up a place in your head to be great....this place exceeded expectations.  Great staff, friendly, amazing food.   ENJOY!  -  Mal from NJ"}
{"text":"Horrible service at the bar. Understaffed. Decent beer list but overpriced garbage for wine. If you have time, go to Blanco Taco in the A gate area. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"What more can be said. Amazing food. Right next to the Farmer's Market on Saturday's. Friendly staff especially the ownwer's wife who noticed that we were new on our first visit and went out of her way to welcome us. The pancakes? Wow! 'Nough said...."}
{"text":"Off the chain as my dad said haha.   My dad was in town so we stumbled across this little joint and we were surprised. There was a little wait but the host informed us that it was a short wait compared to the traffic they usually get on Sunday's. We were seated quickly at the bar which we didn't have an sue with. It's on the louder side, but I don't mind at all.   They have their daily special and Sunday happened to be steak and eggs which sold out a few minutes after we go there, and I ordered the waffles. Everything was so yummy! Truly like a southern breakfast. The waffles were so soft and fluffy, and the eggs were also cooked just the way I like. The ingredients they use seem to be pretty good for you too (real butter olive oil cage free eggs if you're into that kind of stuff)   The staff were so nice too even though it was packed. I'll be returning :)"}
{"text":"We've been to Matt's several times, but it's actually been a couple of years. Last time was actually pre-Yelp for me.  Anyhow, Matt's has not skipped a beat since our last visit. Once you get seated (there is usually a wait) the service is fast and efficient. When I say fast, I mean we ordered and the food was on the table in less than 5 minutes. I had the Skinny, an egg white scramble with chicken sausage. Damn tasty. Wifey had the stock Bacon and Eggs. Matts bacon is the reason we come here. Excellent. Noisy, busy and crowded...but highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome food in a fun setting.  Small place - only about 10 tables plus 4 seats at bar but worth a wait! Go during non peak times and you won't have to wait as long.  The fresh juice was good but in a TINY glass.   It is a fun place but not sure I would wait over an hour for it!"}
{"text":"This place is insanely overrated. Walking in, the place was dirty, and people were running everywhere yet we couldn't get a seat until a waiter yelled at us from across the room to grab a seat in the corner right next to the bathrooms where people kept coming in and out. Being next to the bathroom probably ruined the experience because of the smell. Why even have tables there??   I ordered the skinny with potatoes. It was nothing special whatsoever. The eggs were super greasy and had my stomach churning. The potatoes were also way overcooked, and the rosemary tasted like ornamental, not cooking rosemary.   For the price there is no way I'll be back, but Matt's get's 2 stars and not one because my friend liked his waffle"}
{"text":"The food was decent but not exceptional. The pancakes were way to sweet. My husband got the Chop and Chick and couldn't even cut into it because it was hard. The service was terrible. On the menu it's stated that you get bottomless coffee, that may be true if someone actually came to refill our coffee cups. I will give them one credit - the portions are large but that's expected for their prices. This was my second time there to give it another shot and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food. Attentive servers. Coffee and water refills without asking. The best thick cut bacon! Soooo good. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"What an amazing breakfast experience. Different but all so good. I LOVE that they use all organic products for their food. The toast and strawberry jam was mouth watering. Bacon was so good. We had the daily special and it was so good. We will be back if we ever come back to AZ. I highly recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Hidden gem downtown Phoenix.  Service was fast & friendly, and the pancakes fluffy & perfect for soaking up butter and syrup.  And it's a great deal to boot.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Matt's is DELICIOUS. Yes there is a wait but it's so worth it. Best waffle I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Not seeing why this place is so popular. Crowded. Atmosphere is like eating in a train station. Food was either very bland (the eggs) or spiced up so much (the pork chops) I didn't recognize it. I wouldn't eat here again even if they lowered the prices."}
{"text":"For breakfast purists!  Simple food, simply delicious.  The service is never amazing, but the food always is.  Worth the wait in line if there is one.  I especially love the fresh squeezed orange juice and homemade jam."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm giving five stars to an airport restaurant. Here's why. My husband and I stumbled into Matt's after being stuck overnight in Phoenix, having missed a connection on our way home to CA. Without makeup, in day 2 clothes, and jet-lagged out of my mind, I just wanted to use our meal vouchers on something. Anything.  What we got was just wonderful. Fresh, delicious comfort food. I got a hearty breakfast sandwich with egg and bacon that came with a side of rosemary potatoes. My husband had a giant crispy waffle. My Bloody Mary came garnished with peppers, pickles, cheese cubes, celery, and a slice of bacon.  But what really pushed this review to 5 stars was our server, Michael. He greeted us with sincere warmth and good humor, and kept us laughing and smiling through our meal. Believe me, that was no easy feat based on my mood! He made great suggestions for food and drink, letting me sample the Bloody Mary mix from the drink I selected before ordering (I went with a different one based on his recommendation and I'm glad I did). And when our meal vouchers exceeded the tab, he used the extra to provide us with bottled water for our flight. Not sure when I'll be back in PHX, but I'll eat at Matt's for sure, and will hope for Michael as my server."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite breakfast restaurant of all time. If you like hash browns, this is your place. It's at a great location and I'm normally not a person that eats in the morning but whenever we go here, I eat."}
{"text":"I don't even know what the hell I had because it was soooo dang good that I ate it all and went into a food-itis coma instantly.  Nah just kidding about the memory but totally serious about the food coma.  We checked this place out on an off day and it was still pretty populated.  Breakfast anytime CAN NOT BEAT THAT!!!  My bro and I got the the same platter which was the special of the day.  Linguisa with sourdough toast, hash browns, home fries, eggs, homemade preserves!!!  Everything was SPECTACULAR!  Like seriously!!!  It was a very homey and neighborhood feel to the restaurant with super excellent service.  Ninja water and coffee refills, great timing and check ups!  I think that it was part of our server as well but she was magnificent as well.  The overall experience was really enjoyable and I'll definately be back!"}
{"text":"This place is the only reason I get up at a decent time on the weekends. My boyfriend and I love it! We were going to the downtown location a lot and now we go to Biltmore because it's closer, but downtown always has good service and great food! Love this place so much!"}
{"text":"So in love with this place! My boyfriend and I come here all the time, first going to the downtown location a lot and now that Biltmore is open, closer to us, it's our new regular spot. Service at both of these locations has been great, and so has the food!"}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast is soooo delish! The first time I ever game was after graduation at ASU and it was still in the old location that was tiny! It definitely lived up to everything I'd heard about it. It tastes like good home cooking and everything on the menu is yummy. I also like that them menu isn't huge. My dad and stepmom always want to come here when they are in town visiting and I definitely have no problem with that! I think I would go a lot more if I lived closer to downtown..this is more of a destination breakfast for us (but worth it). The hash browns that come on the side are sooooooo decadent and amazing. Probably the best hash browns I've ever had. There is always a wait but it goes by fairly quickly and there are a couple benches at the newer location so you can sit and wait. Five spot and hog & chick are notable faves. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Over priced breakfast all hype sorry just my opinion I was really let down since friend always talked about it ..you will pay 10$ for breakfast ..eggs and hash browns"}
{"text":"Since moving across the country, I have yet to find a place that even remotely compares to Matt's.  Reasonable prices and delicious specials - the wait is totally worth it.  They could tell me I'd be outside for 3 hours (okay, it's never THAT long) and I'd probably have done it.  The best trick is to put your name on the list and check on the market on Saturday and then come back.  Food is delicious and the orange juice is amazing.  Minimum wait time is usually 15-30 minutes on a good day... but if you want to make your day good, you'll go despite the wait!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great coffee. Great service. Cute waitresses. Long waits but worth it. I recommend the daily specials but Waffle and Bacon is my favorite."}
{"text":"It was crowded but I didn't have to wait since I was a solo diner -- sat right at the counter.  Their bacon is the thing to get. But I really really liked the hashbrown. Typical breakfast platters. I got the hog and chick: 2 eggs, potatoes, bacon, toast!    Get their hashbrowns. They are what dreams are made of."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Very charming and the servers are very nice. It was a long wait but it's only expected... busy means good food. I have their sirloin steak special. It was delicious. They make their own jam and you can taste the love cause it was to die for. They make their own bread and thick cut and you can tell it's healthy. I'm glad we took the time to look where to eat in this area."}
{"text":"I have been here many times. Thought I had reviewed it back in 2010 but guess not. I try to bring all my out of town visitors here. The trick is missing the lines. Best way is to get there 20 mins before the doors open. Their toast alone is worth coming for. Everything you order is cooked to perfection. The homefries are yummy. My friend got pancakes and wanted to get more to bring home. They were that good. Just crowded."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. After seeing this restaurant on Triple D  I was expecting much more than we got. The service was poor, we had to walk over to the counter to ask for drink refills, they didn't  come around asking if we needed anything, and they charged us for 4 drinks instead of 2. The waffles were good but, snall, the real maple syrup was tasty, bacon was good, the potatoes were good. But, the prices were steep for what you got. Won't be going back. Going back to The Place restaurant on 51st ave and bell."}
{"text":"Saw this place on diners, drive ins, and dives so when we planned our vacation to AZ we included this place. Amazing!   When we first saw the menus we were a little worried as it was a bit limited. Once we got our food we knew why. Absolutely delicious!! Most definitely recommend eating here!!"}
{"text":"I got the Salami and Egg Scramble with a hashbrown and unlimited coffee! This place felt very homey, which is how the food tasted as well. You get what you asked for, there's no surprises, no secret honey sauce in the eggs or anything. BUT IT WORKS! I loved the eggs and potatoes!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and I'm not even a huge breakfast person. This was the first time we have been to their new location and its a lot bigger but still quaint. And it made our wait 35 minutes verse the 2 hours it would take before which is awesome! The waitress was attentive and got everything out fast which was nice since we had our wild child with us. Restaurant is super loud so it wasn't a big deal when my daughter got hyper. I got the blt this time and it was great the bacons is thick and crispy. I don't like tomatoes so I should have added avacado or cheese for a little more flavor but still one of the best I've ever had. Lots of homeless people around this area which is fine its phx its to be expected but for some reason they really bother you when you are waiting."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was really little, and honestly since they have moved building the quality in both food and customer service has gone down significantly."}
{"text":"If you have FOOD ALLERGIES you may want to rethink coming here. They DO NOT allow you to substitute and will NOT accomidate you at all. I was dismissed, and treated rudely."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place after it was on tv and considering how much locals rave about but after 3 trips I think its just underwhelming.  Don't get me wrong its better than a chain breakfast place but its not amazing.  I liked their gravy and their preserves....."}
{"text":"Incredible breakfast.  Great service.  Only the best ingredients are being used here.  Very fresh and cooked to perfection.  Prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"Surprisingly the line moves quickly.  I was expecting an hour wait when I saw the line but we were seated within 15-20 minutes.    The menu is very limited and somewhat disappointing.  The daily specials are nice additions but they were unwilling to substitute anything so that was a let down.  I just wanted a different cheese in the scramble and they refused to do so.    The food was good but between the parking and lack of selection I'll probably go elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"I honestly believe the food and setup here is better than the original restaurant downtown.  I had the breakfast sandwich on toast instead of the roll (highly recommend).  If you have an hour plus until your flight and want some breakfast, look no further."}
{"text":"A solid breakfast, but a long wait. Overall it's overrated. At the end of the day they have eggs and bacon and there's nothing much special about that."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped here while on vacation! Biscuits and gravy were amazing! A little spicy for my daughter but perfect for me! Rosemary potatoes....can I have the recipe please! The bacon was phenomenal! And the strawberry lemonade was the most refreshing drink I've ever had! My oldest had the sandwich hich she was really really good. The staff was quick and very polite! They had a huge line outside but they got people in and out quick without making you feel rushed!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  A buddy and I stayed at the Sheraton. We wanted to eat a quick, good, filling breakfast before catching a flight. The walk from the Sheraton to MBB was easy and quick.  This is definitely not a chain. We got there about 7:15am and we were able to sit down right away.   Our waitress was terrific. We told her we weren't trying to sweat her, but we had to catch a flight so she took care of us. Service was prompt and friendly. I wish i remembered her name.  Wasn't sure what to order. Asked her. She said waffles. Definitely the waffles. I RARELY order or eat waffles. I don't know why. I just don't. They were awesome and hit the spot! The bacon was thick cut, crisp, and flavorful.   Coffee was good.  We left around 7:45am. The line was out the door.   I strongly recommend MBB if you are staying downtown. It will be well worth it!"}
{"text":"No matter how many times ive returned here over the years when im back in town, this is still my number one go to for breakfast in Phoenix! Everything is as fresh as fresh can be! Their honey lemonades have been my favorite beverage to go with their delicious and hearty breakfasts. Food here is next level flavor, dont believe me? Come in and see for yourself! Ask for home fries, not the hash browns!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait. I love this place! What a neat spot. The waiters were friendly the food was great and the atmosphere was wonderful! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Drive all the way from Buckeye to Matt's at least once every other week. It's so worth the drive...and the wait Beware...you will have at least a 15 min. wait. But it is soooo worth it! Best Waffles I have EVER had. Bacon is as it should be, thick, crispy and MEATY! I haven't even started on the homefries...YUM! They use all fresh ingredients bought locally, even the coffe is bought from a local place, Cave Creek Coffee. They have me hooked...  Do yourself a favor, come down here, order ANYTHING and enjoy! You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Spot was dope!  Nice view!  Staff is super duper friendly! Menu could use a little more variety, more non pork items!  Food was good and larger portions!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but very well worth it. Everything even the ketchup and sauces are from scratch. Great sized portions. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"The Good:  I like the vibe of this place, a pleasant neighborhood type greasy spoon, but not dingy and grease-spattered.  Attentive wait staff.  Good opportunities for people watching.  I had the Hog and Chick.  Excellent hash browns...riced potatoes with a nice greasy bottom with pan drippings and pepper clinging to them.  Just the way I like them!   The strawberry jam with the toast was superb.  And the coffee hot and tasty...no need for cream.  The bacon was curiously unflavorful.  Next time I'd get sausage.  Not sure what went wrong with it...not enough salt/smoke in the curing?  It was cooked okay, just not a lot of flavor to it.  (Of course, I still finished it...even mediocre bacon is still bacon!)  $12 for a breakfast seemed a bit on the high side, but not super exorbitant.  Had the bacon been good I would not mention the cost.  Still a fan though.  3.5 stars would be a better rating."}
{"text":"A-OK is right and the hype is not always worth the wait. I will keep it simple since there are probably 500 reviews on the place.  Pros:  Great Hashbrowns, and made from scratch food  Good specials to keep things mixed up  Great company and service  Cons:  Guy up front says a little over 35 minutes but really means an hour and 45 minutes  Pricey for some dishes  Interesting people around while you wait to get inside (street walkers, etc.)  the fresh squeezed orange juice is enough liquid to maybe fill up a double shot glass  Overall I would love to give this place more stars if I could get in there without wanting to eat a finger due to starvation, and leave a bit more satisfied. Anyone who has eaten at Bryan's in San Diego would know what I mean."}
{"text":"best breakfeast downtown ... bar none ... it's far more \"healthy\" than I traditionally prefer but the place is beatiful, very cool and has an ADORABLE waitress ;) !!!!"}
{"text":"Service was efficient and friendly. The omelette and hash browns  were amazing. We were disappointed with the pancakes. they were so dry and crumbly. Extra syrup didn't help much. Coffee was really good but no half and half milk only"}
{"text":"Fact: Matt's Big Breakfast has pretty much ruined breakfast for me for all of eternity. Since first trying it a few years back, I've found that it's done so exceptionally well that I'm constantly making comparisons between Matt's and every other breakfast place in Phoenix. And my conclusion remains consistent:  Absolutely no one compares.  Thriving off of simplicity in a similar manner to Pizzeria Bianco, Matt's doesn't need 500 different types of pancakes, all with varying amounts of rubbish dumped all over them. Blasting thumpy music, making up stupid names for omlettes, or serving up liquor in the AM as a means to be \"edgy\" are all silly gimmicks that are absolutely unnecessary when your food tastes like this. The fact is, when your food is good, you don't need tricks and tactics in order to compensate. Keep the choices minimal, the dishes fairly traditional, and the quality high and you have an automatic formula for success. Don't believe me? Look at the lines on the weekend.  Practically all foods you find here are either homemade or outsourced locally. I'm told there's no freezer and technically, if food is fresh, isn't that the way it should be? I typically order the Hog & Chick, scrambling up my eggs with one or two of their cheeses. The bacon, which comes from the Pork Shop in Queen Creek, is thick, juicy, peppered, and absolutely fabulous. There is no bacon I've found that even comes close. Add in some hash browns (extra crispy) that have butter cooked directly into them, some toast that's complimented by homemade jam that's personally made by Matt's wife, and you're pretty much covered for a great morning meal. The jam can also be purchased separately by the jar for home use. Even their orange juice and honey lemonades impress!  The Five Spot, which is a sandwich that combines some of the ingredients I just mentioned, is also worth trying. Although I prefer being able to appreciate these foods individually rather than combining them all. Their griddlecakes and waffle are excellent, being served with syrup that's actually hot (other places should take note of this). Although I don't regularly order either, as they come at the expense of missing out on the smaller side dishes (unless your stomach has the extra space).  Service is good, food is great, and parking is a pain (an unwritten legal requirement for all good restaurants near downtown). I've been told they have a great lunch, but with breakfast this good, I don't think I have I'll ever have the willpower to order anything lunch-related.  French toast, which is strangely absent from the permanent menu, is actually a special on Wednesdays and also worth checking out.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Imagine the original Matt's Big Breakfast, only in a slightly smaller setting. The menu is the same, the food is the same, and the service is the same. The only difference?  Now, you actually have a place to park your damned car!  We've been waiting on this Matt's location to open for quite some time to the point where they were so far past their originally projected launch date that I had almost forgotten about it. And then, just on a whim, browsing through Yelp, I noticed that it had quietly opened its doors back in January.    Honestly, there isn't really anything I can say about Matt's that I didn't say in my review of the original location. The breakfast served here is what I consider to be the gold standard. It's traditional breakfast food that thrives on simplicity, without the need to be annoyingly trendy with stupid gimmicks like 500 different types of omelets or offering up liquor at 7am in the morning. Keep it simple, keep it good, and ultimately, you don't need all that other crap to keep customers coming back for more. Now, if you're used to only going to breakfast places that offer a Bible-sized menu of dishes to select from, this might not be the place for you.  In my opinion, you really can't go wrong with anything, including the thick cuts of peppered bacon, butter-infused hash browns, homemade jam, and various honey lemonades and orange juice. The quality of the food at this location is consistent with what we've come to expect.  If you come during busy weekend hours, don't expect the addition of an extra location to have an impact on wait times. It's just one of those things that we've all learned to tolerate. Good food can't always be kept secret, unfortunately.  In some ways, I do see this location as kind of an odd choice. It's not really very far from the other Matt's, so it's not like anyone is pocketing all this extra gas money by going here instead of downtown. But in the end, who really cares? Matt's could open up a location at the bottom of a tar pit and I'd still give them five stars for the food alone.  It's simply the best!"}
{"text":"Everyone loves Matts. I don't need to review it...   I do want to fill you in on the new location they just moved to in 2013, a block north of the old. It is larger, thank Gawd! but not much, thank Gawd again. That was part of the charm. Go on a weekday, when you have the day off and it wont be crowded. Being a sucker and going on Saturday at 9:45am is surely going to cause you to wait in line. Thats rookie business.   But the new location, is still small enough to keep its charm and unique, downtown, local vibe but large enough to not have to pull tables together for a 4 top!   Their food, menu, daily specials, and coffee all still consistent and amazing as always."}
{"text":"Decent food for an airport.  Everything was fresh and all American.  Was disappointed in the foul language coming from one of the servers who wasn't quite sure what he wanted to be yet??  Food was great. Language and his obnoxious demeanor were strange."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and I was excited.  Good service.  Clean establishment.  Seated quickly.  We had a waffle and the egg/sausage/hash brown combo.  Both came out fast and were very good.  The fresh OJ was ok...not as amazing as I had hoped.  Overall I liked it and I will return.  The omelette with everything is the best in Phoenix.  Truth."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident I had family visiting from out of town who wanted to find a local breakfast joint so we just ventured off and luckily we did. I just relocated from Denver and live in downtown only a few minutes from Matt's Big Breakfast. They seem to always have a wait even during week but to me it's well worth it."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped into here because there wasn't much to choose from at the Phoenix airport. We arrived around 7:30-8am and it was packed. We were seated fairly quickly though.   We were originally seated at the one of the tall tables and after sitting on a plane for over 5 hours, those chairs are so uncomfortable. A booth became available and we asked to be seated there and they let us. So I was thankful for that.   The food was pretty good. Just your regular breakfast options. We ordered Matt's big breakfast with an extra egg and toast to split. It comes with sausage, bacon, two eggs, home fries and a pancake. I enjoyed everything except the sausage, but my fiancé liked it all. Home fries were flavored very well. Eggs were cooked perfectly. I also ordered a side of Mac Salad, which isn't normally available until 11:30, but they had it ready so they let me.  For the amount of people that were there and only 3 guys cooking, the food and time that it came out in was impressive. Our server was very friendly and she was very accommodating. We had a good experience here."}
{"text":"Matt's is a solid breakfast spot. It's an upgrade on a typical breakfast diner except high quality food and coffee and done from scratch. Try to get there before 9am because a line will start forming! I love that they use whole and natural ingredients and even make their own berry preserves and ketchup. The service is also fast and staff are great and friendly. The main reason I don't absolutely loooove Matt's is because the food never \"wows\" me. It's meat, potatoes, and eggs. (Although the homefries are awesome with little bits of fresh rosemary and herbs) They have rotating specialty items every day of the week and I would love to try their eggs benedict or biscuits and gravy but I work full time and will never make it on a Monday or Tuesday."}
{"text":"I attended a 3-day conference in Phoenix in June, and ate breakfast at Matt's twice. Both times I ordered the standard eggs, potatoes, bacon and toast, and it was absolutely perfect. To a \"T\". Eggs were cooked exactly to order, the bacon was among the best I've ever eaten (maybe THE best), and the rosemary potatoes simply delicious. What impressed me the most was that everything was precisely, perfectly the same on the 2nd visit. I can't go halfway across the country just to go to Matt's, but thinking about it sure makes me want to plan a trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I heard good things about the main Matt's Big Breakfast chain, but this one was very mediocre. Maybe it's because airport food is never as high quality as outside food, I'm not entirely sure.   We had the Sonrisa Burrito, which was decent. I liked the thin tortilla that they used and the salsa was a nice addition, but the burrito was very oily and dripped a ton as we ate it. Their potatoes were also undercooked and had a weird texture to them...   I'm usually a huge fan of breakfast burritos, but I wish I had skipped Matt's Big Breakfast and tried Sweet Republic next door at the terminal (even if it was 10 in the morning!)."}
{"text":"Amazing! Such a fun little restaurant. It adds character to downtown Phoenix and the food is great! I got the hot cakes, which were huge and tasted so free, with real butter and real maple syrup. The service was friendly and the atmosphere made me feel like I was back in time at a cute little dinner but with a modern twist. My friend had the special, which was eggs benedict and hashbrowns. Also amazing and you can tell all the ingredients are farm fresh. I'm salvating just thinking about it! The wait wasn't too bad for us. We got their right around 9am and waited for 20 minutes, ate in 40 minutes. However there was quite the line of people after us. I don't suggest going in a large group and only go if you have time for a relaxing morning, long wait but they feed you quickly- but not rushed!"}
{"text":"The orange juice tasted kind of off but everything else was delicious. My favorite might have been their homemade jam with the thick cut toast. I ordered scrambled eggs and potatoes as well, and the potatoes are full of flavor. I definitely left full and would come back again."}
{"text":"It's simple food served quickly in a trendy area. High prices but the quality was there to back it up. Nothing blew me away to warrant this place's high ratings, but it may be because I don't eat eggs--I had the Waffle, hash-browns and sausage."}
{"text":"Was a tad tricky for us out-of-towners to find. Just look for the white and orange sign that will lead you to the free covered parking lot. Breakfast is as good as I remember from the original location. The most tastiest pancakes ever. The only reason I did not give the 5th star is they do not allow outside beverages to be brought in. I sadly sucked my iced coffee down in a hurry."}
{"text":"The food was great, and very reasonable. The food is simple breakfast food, nothing too fancy. There is a lunch menu, but breakfast is the star of the show.  The hostess was very rude, which is why I only gave 3 stars. When we arrived and put our name in, we asked if we could have a glass of ice water, as it was rather warm out. She said we could pay for a glass, but would not give us water until we we were seated. This is ridiculous and her curt tone added insult to injury."}
{"text":"There is always a wait unless you get here really early, but it is worth it if you know what you are getting in to. There are always so many tourists here, but it is understandable cause the food is great. It was recently my fourth time at Matt's Big Breakfast and I finally got my own plate of waffles instead of eating them off my boyfriend's plate. Best waffles ever and I don't usually go for the sweet breakfast foods.   If you like reubens and it is lunch time here then GET THE REUBEN!! It is so good! The bread that it is on really makes the whole sandwich.   Everyone in Phoenix should try Matt's Big Breakfast at least once."}
{"text":"Great place - but get here early if you want to get your day going!  This place fills up fast and stays full!     Small place but personal service.   Coffee and creamer is excellent - not sure of their secret ;)  I've had the pork chop plate (don't recall the name), waffle, and the Schreiner's local sausage and egg scramble.   No, I didn't have all this at one time, this was over the course of several trips LOL.   Everything was excellent with the exception of the Schreiner's deal - I didn't realize it had rye seed in the sausage and I'm totally anti-rye.     Other than that everything I've tried, the experience, and service was great.  Clean.  3.5 stars easily earned, I'd give 3.9 actually..."}
{"text":"My sister, a family friend, and I visited Matt's Big Breakfast this afternoon at lunchtime and had a great meal. She opted for a simple eggs and sausage breakfast plate, he had the daily special (a scramble with chicken sausage, potatoes and cheese) and I had the salami scramble. My sister enjoyed her food and she even ate some of the sourdough toast which is a huge deal because she rarely eats bread. It's THAT good! My meal was delicious: the hash browns were crunchy, there was a hefty amount of salami in the scramble, and I, too, enjoyed the toast and House-made strawberry jam that accompanies it.   However, I took away a star because the service wasn't great. Having worked in the food service industry in the past, I know how hard it can be during a lunch rush, and I tried to be understanding. But the seating area at Matt's isn't large and I watched our server stand and do nothing many times while our drinks were only refilled once the entire time we were seated and eating."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  I was able to get seated immediately.  Service was excellent.  The food was awesome.  Definitely recommend the waffle.  This location was great but unfortunately cannot say the same about the airport location.  Service was extremely slow for being in the airport.  Would definitely recommend the downtown location though.  I will be back next time in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast joint also has lunch menu.  Prices fair, portions good, food taste amazing,wonderful customer service. Very clean establishment, alot buisness attired customers. I luv it!! Food presentation is outstanding. Well done, id come back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I just... what? What's all the fuss about? This is literally one of the worst breakfast spots I've ever been to. Bland eggs, bland hash browns, bland potatoes, bland toast. At least the blueberry jam was nice. Everything I paid $12+ for here, I could have made at home, for better quality. No biscuits and gravy??? I... what??? If you're going to have such an extremely limited menu, you better do it right, and matts isn't doing it right.  The waffle was pretty good however.   Way too many good breakfast spots to ever come back here."}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast at Matt's today and loved everything about the experience. The space is super cool, the service is excellent, and they have the BEST waffles. I left with a very happy belly. I'll definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Look. Matt's is good. But is it great? No. It's just good breakfast. Sure, it's a lot better than Denny's or IHOP, but there's a lot of great breakfast places in Phoenix that I'd rather go to, not really wait in line and get the same quality food."}
{"text":"stopped by here on the way back home to eat something for breakfast while driving so I ordered The Five Spot w/o grilled onions.. it was really good and would order it again, I ate half of it and was saving the rest for later and my wife threw the bag away damnit! also got the honey lemonade and really enjoyed that also"}
{"text":"Ive always been afraid to come here because of the wait. I finally said screw it since we didn't have any plans so we might as well wait.  I ordered the pancakes with a side of bacon and my wife and daughter shared some eggs with hashbrowns and my picky grandma got a cheese omelette.   The pancakes are great but just like any other breakfast place you never get enough butter and syrup. The bacon was the BEST ever and everybody really liked the hasbrowns. you could go eat just the bacon and be happy and leave oh and they strawberry lemonade was really good also. would love to come back."}
{"text":"Does anyone actually wait more than once for this?  We waited 1 hour; thankfully, it was a beautiful morning.  Once inside we had trouble sitting on the bar stools, they are so small and slippery.(We aren't large people)   I stood up to eat my breakfast.  My husband enjoyed his Iowa pork chop, but my ham and cheese omelet was generic."}
{"text":"I heard lots of good stuff regarding this place so I decided to check it out and here's what I concluded  1. Space: first of all this place is really, really, really tiny so sitting situations are way too close for comfort.  I recommend small party with 4 people max.  2. Menu: just because its listed does not mean its available.  3. Quality: not so great, my hash browns were burnt (more like hash blacks) and the rest of the food too greasy. I myself is not a big fan of Fat.  4. Beverage: uh, I rather go to Circle K and get a cup.  5: Service: ok, but for such a limited customers how can service go wrong?    All in all I was not impress with this place.  I even went back for lunch thinking maybe it was only during breakfast that this place lacked the hype that everybody was talking about, but once again I very disappointed.    BTW i like my Burger with Butter and not Butter with Burger."}
{"text":"Loved it. Had the Skinny which was the perfect light breakfast before heading out to hike Camelback. Andrea and the rest of the staff were great and backed each other up like a well oiled machine. The coffee was robust and never emptied or cooled too far. Orange juice was fresh and complimented the egg whites and spinach of the Skinny just right. Good playlist in the background as well. Couldn't have asked for a better breakfast that Memorial Day morning."}
{"text":"FLY THRU BREAKFAST  I was flying through the PHX airport & had a 3 hour layover. I searched Yelp & found many 4 star restaurants. How could this be? It's an airport! Airports never have good food, so I decided to spend some time walking around checking them out before making my choice. I finally decided to eat at Matt's because it seemed like the all American Breakfast.   The place was packed at 8:30 in the morning. I wanted to sit at the bar but took the first available seat at a community table. I then noticed there were power outlets scattered through the space but not every seat had access to power. I then asked the hostess if she could find me a spot where I could eat and juice up my phone. She spotted an opening at the bar & told me to grab it. When I arrived I had to squeeze between two guys. My new neighbors were excited to learn about the outlets & they quickly plugged in their devices. So be aware power is available here you're just going to need to find it before you sit down.   I looked through the menu & I wanted to eat everything. I finally decided to go with Matt's Big Breakfast. It had a little bit of everything. I must also point out that the food is made fresh from scratch with the finest local ingredients around. I love that & I could taste that love in the food.   My dish came with 3 fresh cage free eggs which I ordered sunny side up. These eggs were no yolk. The eggs tasted amazing & reminded me of Phil's Organic Eggs we buy in the Chicagoland area.  This place locally sources there food & it makes a difference.   The thick cut bacon is from a local butcher in Queen Creek, AZ & it was so delicious. It was cooked perfectly & had hints of pepper on it. My breakfast even had sausage that was formed into patties. The sausage came from a local butcher up the street near their downtown location. It was some of the freshest sausage I've ever had. I loved it because it reminded me of the sausage patties I make at home for breakfast. It is so nice to have a hand formed patty &!not something over processed & frozen in a factory.   I really liked the home fries. I'm usually not a fan because this breakfast item at other restaurants is always tasteless & dry but not here. A lot of love goes into this side dish. They take Yukon Gold Potatoes, first boil them, then they bake them and finally finish them off by frying them in butter. They also add some sautéed onions & then season them with salt, pepper & rosemary. These potatoes are as good as my breakfast potatoes & I don't share that kind of compliment with just anyone.   I washed all of that down with a house made griddle cake which is just a fancy word for pancake. This was one of the best pancakes I've had in a long time. The best part it was topped with real sweet cream butter & real Maple syrup. Both of these toppings pushed this amazing griddle cake beyond extraordinary. I didn't use all the butter but it tasted like real butter which is something I don't taste anymore with all of the fake processed food we are being served. I'd like to pass a law that says, \"If there is no Real Syrup then you can not serve pancakes!\"  Sorry Aunt Jemima but you don't cut it anymore. Real is the way to go.   Prior to leaving to go & catch my plane I stopped at the pass to tell the staff how much I loved their food. I wanted them to know I appreciated all of their hard work.  They were cranking out some great food. The kitchen space is not big at all yet they kept making fantastic food to hungry travelers.   There were many breakfast options on the menu. I was enjoying seeing what all my neighbors at the bar were getting.  The scrambled eggs with spicy salami looked so good. It was on my list but it didn't come with a pancake so I opted for Matt's Big Breakfast. The breakfast sandwich & breakfast burrito looked good too. I would love to mention that this place is priced great & it won't break your travel budget. My whole dish was $12.50 which is totally reasonable for everything I ordered.   I must mention that there is a full bar. Everyone around me was drinking but it was 8:30am on a Friday morning. I couldn't do it, after 8 days in Vegas. I really didn't want to see liquor again.  The real temptation was when the person across from me ordered one of the Bloody Mary's. I wanted to ask them if I could take a photo of it but I didn't want to be that guy. It was one of those that was not only a drink but a meal too.  I will always have an image of that masterpiece in my head.   So if you're flying through PHX then do your foodie homework because there are many great options to eat at here. You will really be surprised at all the great ratings for the restaurants. I do highly recommend you stop in here for breakfast. Matt's has a great All-American breakfast that will keep you going all day long. You make me want to connect through PHX now when I fly."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed the food at Matt's. The hash browns and homemade sourdough bread was amazing!"}
{"text":"The hash browns had a unique sweet taste, the vibe was hipster and vintage, sourdough toast was thick and tasty with a unique side of actual fresh blueberry marmalade. I enjoyed my salami scramble and will probably be back soon!"}
{"text":"There was a bit of a wait for breakfast here and now I know why!  It was absolutely delicious.  I love the decor as well.  But the food was what really rocked my world.  I had the salami scramble, i think it was called and I added cheese to it.  It was amazing.  The hashbrowns...to die for.  I was in food heaven.  I also love that the butter your toast so the butter melts, I miss that in Chicago.  Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"Finally made it over to Matt's Big Breakfast, and I'm glad I did!  This place is your quintessential get-in/get-out breakfast joint, but with local ingredients in a clean open atmosphere.  We ordered the breakfast sandwich (bacon, marinated onions and american cheese) and salami scramble for breakfast.  The scramble came with a choice of hash browns or home potatoes, so I went with the hash browns.  I must say, I think those were my favorite part of the meal!! The outside of the hash was super crisp, and the inside potatoes were luscious and almost creamy tasting. 10/10 would order again.    Service was also good.  Our waitress was fast, sharp and on point.  She was good about keeping our water and coffee glasses full, and I appreciated the amount of times we were checked on.  All in all, I had a enjoyable quick breakfast, and look forward to going back to see what else they have to offer :)"}
{"text":"Matts big breakfast is awesome. It took me back to when I was a kid and how my morning breakfasts with the family were !! I will be back"}
{"text":"This might be a top 3 breakfast I've ever eaten. Perfect size portions and reasonable prices. The bacon is delicious it's a pepper crusted bacon. The home fries are delicious potatoes with rosemary. The bread that came with it was a sourdough. I couldn't get enough of. Service was great everyone working there was friendly. I will definitely be eating here in my return flight next week."}
{"text":"Garbage service, garbage food loaded with butter, not fresh, super greasy. My husband and I had a stomach ache all day after that disgusting meal. After all that when paying the bill the stupid waiter asked us to get up and go so that they can seat others. So extremely rude and an awful experience. Never ever will I go back there. YUCK!!"}
{"text":"We liked the citrus infused water while you wait on benches under shady trees. The freshly squeezed OJ which was so good, thick sliced bacon (the meat is fresh from Queen Creek), the hash browns were freshly shredded, the jalapeños were fresh, the waffles with real whipped butter and real Vermont maple syrup were mouth watering! I loved the fresh roses on the tables, the exposed brick on one wall, and the big windows on another side with natural light coming in. The servers, managers, and all the staff were friendly and nice, too! We WILL definitely be back! It was worth the 40 minute wait for a table."}
{"text":"Ok so the look of the portions in the pictures are very deceptive.  The waffle and pancakes arent big as they look, however I am stuffed so I guess the waffle was big enough.  the food was very good, I thought it would be better, but I am not disappointed.  I would come back here :) the waffle was not as good as the farm and the pancakes were not as good as first watch. but thats just my opinion.  Next time I want to try some of their scrambles."}
{"text":"Hey this place is a classic down town breakfast joint. They sure dont need a A+ review from me, but what the hell. This Place Is Awesome.I love riding my bike to this funky little diner. I always get the breakfast special; this time it was scrambled eggs, ham, fresh jalapenos, and pepper jack cheese, with a side of home frys. Holy Sh** it was good! Everything is super fresh, affordable, and clean. The portions are big, so be mindful of spiting with a friend if so inclined. Also I would recommend getting your delicious food to go and sit in the park just to the south. The wait to sit inside can be very long."}
{"text":"There 5-10 min.  Employees make eye contact then ignore. Tell manager and she gives me the \"oh so sorry\" scripted response.  Terrible customer service and based on mgrs response I know why."}
{"text":"I had a layover in Phoenix and decided to get some breakfast for dinner (the best time to get breakfast, right?). Matt's biggest breakfast was large enough to split between two people. The highlight was definitely the griddle cake - it was crispy yet fluffy and just really flavorful. The eggs were good, the bacon was super flavorful and the sausages were smashed and delicious. We ordered a side of toast, but we could have skipped them - they are a little too thick for my liking.  If you're in terminal B1-14 and you feel like grabbing some breakfast foods, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"60 degrees and they had the 20 feet of doors open. asked the waitress and she said management wanted them open. Heard at least 3 other customers complain but to noavail. There was a young man there that appeared to be the manager but not sure. Ordered the pig and chic, bacon good, eggs were very small. one piece of sourdough with some strange tasting preserves. The potatoes were raw in the middle and the rosemary and onions were burnt, inedible. Wife got a waffle and said it was good, asked for more syrup and was told its organic and its a dollar more. barely enough for half a waffle i work at marina heights and smell the food every morning and wanted to try it since seeing the diners driveins and dives show. Well 25.00 later and wont be coming back here."}
{"text":"As a person that travels for a living I've had my share of bad airport food but this place makes up for all of it. Excellent food, fresh, plentiful and great service. I will make it a point to visit them again and I bookmarked the main restaurant in the city.  The waffles were perfect and the Reuben was too.  Don't hesitate to visit them when you're at the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"While in Phoenix, walked to Matt's for breakfast on Saturday morning. Not being really familar with it, I had no expectations. We ended up having to wait over an hour to be seated - mostly because this place is really freaking small. (If you have a big group, you'll take up the entire restaurant and that's just rude.) The menu is pretty sparse, but has something for everyone. I got the hog and chick - with scrambled eggs (just ok), thick cut bacon (it was heavy on the pepper but good), hash browns (odd, the home fries looked better) and sourdough toast (next time, I'm just getting the toast. The sourdough was awesome). With a coffee, I think my total was around $10-11 - not too bad.   Overall, if it was a random day during the week with no wait, I'd be more excited. I'm not sure it was worth the wait - but my cousin is still talking about how great it was."}
{"text":"I love this place ! Came all the way from California to try it. We were in Arizona 3 days and went to Matts every morning!! Love the quality of the food. I enjoyed the bacon and eggs and I especially loved my toast. Some people don't know quality if it slaps them in the face. I Also got an oj and a coffee! Next time I'm In town I'm going straight back to matts"}
{"text":"There aren't that many good places to eat in Sky Harbor...mainly bland chains or local restaurants trying to do their best impression of their original location but falling far from the same. This Matt's is definitely not as good as the original in downtown Phoenix, but when you have no choice and need a good breakfast before your flight, stopping here is a fairly good choice. My wife and I ordered the hog and chick. The meat was savory and the egg was adequately seasoned. I loved how the bacon was a little more wet/chewy than dry/crispy, as I tend to dislike the latter. I didn't get a chance to try their signature pancakes this time but they didn't look that bad either."}
{"text":"Okay, I think I was a dick the first time I wrote a review of Matt's, so i'll try again.  I don't like lines.  No, I mean I really don't like lines and I have horrible Disney World nightmares that sometimes wake me up.  Despite my hatred of lines, I love Matt's and I dream of Matt's, too, and sometimes I even find myself in line at Matt's in the blazing heat, waiting for those wonderful pancakes and floating like Bugs Bunny to a carrot.  I think I said something silly in my last review, like, \"I won't go back for months because of the lines,\" but I was back and I felt guilty, so I'm rewriting the review to assuage my guilt and allow me a future guilt-free experience as I devour their pancakes.  I wasn't kidding about the scooter gang, though.  Seriously, there was a scooter gang in line."}
{"text":"Had a lot of breakfasts at Matt's, but this morning was terrible.  Found a hair coming out of the top of my wife's omelet like a weed.  They apologized, but they didn't comp the omelet.  WTF???  Bad management.  Won't go back. Yuck."}
{"text":"Well, I have heard such good things about this place and well...it didn't live up to the hype!  The poached eggs swimming in water and the mini sausages had no flavor, and the hashbrowns were just gooey inside! But the bread and jams were a treat and the attention that we got from OTHER servers and management was impressive!  But I will not suggest going nor would I visit again!"}
{"text":"Wife took me to breakfast this morning. My daughter told us to try this place. So here we are at around 8:30 AM and the place is busy. Had to wait about 10 minutes for a table...beats waiting an hour on the weekends. If your a twosome, you have a faster chance of getting a table. I had their Salami Scramble with hash browns and sour dough. My wife had the Hog & Chick with home fries and sour dough.  The last time I had soppresata salami was when I was a kid. The dish was great as long as you're a salami lover. It just brought back great memories as a teenager in North Beach in San Francisco eating a salami sandwich on a hard roll for lunch.  The hash browns were a little over cooked, but hey, they were hash browns. One other thing, the sour dough was actually sliced from a loaf of sour dough bread which came with homemade jam. We will return."}
{"text":"Who is Matt? Why is his breakfast so big? Why are there lines out the door on a regular basis? Why am I able to without hesitation give this place full marks?  I took Kristy to this place one cold Fiesta Bowl morning when Jonny decided he needed to sleep in rather than entertain his guests!  Somehow, I remembered that I needed to arrive around 8am if I would get a seat and parking and not starve at the door.  We walked right in!  This intimate kitchen setting stashed in the middle of downtown nowhere really is the BIG attraction in the area.  Wholesomely good with organic everything and home grown and home made this and that, I found myself ooohing and aaaahing before even opening my mouth to sample the tea and grapefruit juice!  EVERYONE's food seem to lure me in and I actually had a VERY hard time selecting just one item that I wanted for breakfast.  The menu is not big. But my eyes were as a re-contemplated the implications of not getting one item or selecting another option over another.  I landed somehow on the omelette!  Original n'est pas? I enjoyed everything about it.  Kristy got the pancakes and coffee and is still talking about how this was the next best thing to do if  you were denied a promised road trip by a hungover friend to Sedona!"}
{"text":"Maybe I am missing something but I don't understand the hype.  They didn't have soda on tap and just RC Cola cans which is fine but I do want my caffeine in the AM and I'm not a coffee drinker.  The food on the menu sounds excellent but once we received it I was underwhelmed. It felt like items I could easily make at home.  Gave it two stars because the bacon was good and crispy."}
{"text":"Get the blueberry honey lemonade! Three egg omelette and pancakes were good! Busy but short wait on a Thursday morning at 10am."}
{"text":"IT WAS AMAZING. My friends and I were on a road trip to the Grand Canyon and also visiting a friend in the area, so we decided to stop by this place. It was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-In's and Dives and definitely worth every minute of it!   We got their daily special - spicy chirizo sausages with eggs, jalapeños and with hash browns on the side. The food came out pretty quickly and it was just perfect. The fresh jalapeños added a slight kick but the spiciness did not overwhelm the taste of the sausages. The eggs that were scrambled in with the meat was perfectly light and fluffy. Their hashbrowns were fried with butter, so it tasted a bit different from your typical hashbrowns. I am not a huge fan of butter fried anything, so I didn't really care for it, but my friends all LOVED it.  One of my friends got the waffles with a strip of bacon, and the bacon was thick and crispy, cooked just right. Also, don't forget about the coffee! It's delicious - not too acidic like Starbucks, just the way I like it.   The decor in the restaurant is also very cute - bright yellow doors, retro looking posters on the walls, a small traditional diner like table sectioning off one of the corners. All of our servers were super friendly and made the entire experience a blast. If you are in the area, it's definitely a place you have to check out!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever.  Matts never lets me down.  Amazing pork chop breakfast. Perfectly prepared. Great 1 inch thick sourdough toast. Fresh squeezed OJ.  Nice people. Great bar.   Great surprise at a major airport!"}
{"text":"I like that they use local farm products and some of the stuff is organic. The strawberry honey lemonade was different and good. I got the hog and chick breakfast - eggs were great, hash browns were super greasy, but spot on with the texture and taste. I prefer crispy bacon, which this wasn't but it had a good flavor. And the strawberry preserves on the white sourdough toast were excellent. I like that they have different specials every day of the week, so I need to come back and try the eggs Benedict, French toast, and biscuits and gravy at some point!  Very tasty menu and a cute little place.  There wasn't much of a wait - and the service was quick so that was nice."}
{"text":"I will not be back.   Yes, the food is very very good... but it is not the best breakfast I've ever had.   We waited outside for an hour.  There are only two umbrellas for shade and this morning, there was no water in the jug.      The service could not have been worse--everyone seemed slow and apathetic.   When we were finally seated, we were placed on stools in the window where tourists were taking pictures of us eating/the inside.  If you need to use the restroom, they send you to the hotel next door."}
{"text":"Let me preface that I am 6'4\" and 275lbs so when I found Matt's Big Breakfast I felt at home.   I had a waffle and two strips of bacon.   The Bacon was excellent and the waffle was nice and crisp.   The reason for the 2 star rating was related to the \"Big\" reference.  I had different expectations obviously.  So I ordered eggs on the side, 4 to be exact.  I asked the waitress for some more syrup for my waffle as the portion served was meager to be kind.  It was explained that it came from Vermont so I was only getting the portion that was previously provided but I could have blueberry preserves if I wanted something else.  I asked the cost of more syrup and I opted to try the Blueberry preserves.  I don't remember the exact quoted amount but it seemed excessive as my check was already just shy of $20.00 and that is just drinking water.    For what it is worth the location and convenience was great.  The food was tasty and the waitress was great.  I was just expecting more from \"Big\" breakfast."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for dinner on a Sunday night and where the terminal overall was slow, this restaurant was hopping!  Pretty popular place it seems.  I was flying solo and was found a seat quickly when I approached.     I tell you, the customer service here alone was enough to make me want to go back!  The host and the server were both excellent.    The food I had also was spot on!  I had burger with this jalapeno aioli that reminded me of hatch green chilis!! Not sure what they did but man it was so yummy!   I also paid a couple extra bucks and got the steak fries.  Normally not my thing but these came out crispy and were served with an A1 BBQ sauce.   So good together with the burger.  I can't speak to the breakfast as I only had dinner here but I'd be willing to try it out if in Phoenix for breakfast!    Safe travels!!!!"}
{"text":"Having never been to the infamous downtown location (it's still on my radar) I gave the airport location a shot. First of all, what's with all of the uber-popular eateries coming to Terminal 4? I've see Le Grande Orange, Olive & Ivy, Four Peaks, Blanco, Chelsea's.. I mean seriously.   OK, not sure about the negative reviews so far. This is a WYSIWYG restaurant, no gimmicks just good American breakfast and lunch food. The griddlecakes were awesome, and their bottomless coffee was great to wash them down. I had to ask for more maple syrup as I like to drown my cakes! I was catching an early flight to Dallas so I beat the \"rush\" that I've seen in other Yelp photos. The staff was friendly enough, I'd just wish the seating area was more spread out (it feels congested) but I guess they h ad to work with the space they were given.   The food is excellent, the prices are fair, the service was fast- I was in and out in 20 minutes. I say give this place a shot!!"}
{"text":"Came here while on vacation here! This place was amazing. Can be easily found near the light rail station. The servers were  very freindly and remembered me after I had come in the day before. The food was awesome! The bacon was thick cut and well cooked! They make thier pancakes from scratch and also thier jam from scratch. This place can get busy on weekends but don't always expect a line out the door as some of the Yelp pictures suggest. Great experience and will be back if I return to the area."}
{"text":"Not about taste, as my To Go order was very tasty.  I ordered 2 scrambled eggs, subbed pork sausage for chicken apple sausage, didn't get the toast, and hash browns ... $15!!! Are you KIDDING me???? Do you realize how many other places a person can go for eggs and sausage for half the price?? And there was only 1 sausage link! There was nothing fancy or special about it. Sorry, Matt's ... not paying $15 again."}
{"text":"During my Spring Training trip in Arizona, my friends & I wanted to look for a good place to either get breakfast or brunch in the morning.  We found Matt's Big Breakfast on Yelp; and with over 550+ reviews with an average of 4-stars, we decided that this was the place to try out.  We came here on a Friday at 11am on 3/27/15 during Spring Training.  We thought that if we arrived after the breakfast hour and before the lunch hour, we could beat the crowd.  We were wrong!  This place was ultra crowded!  We put our name down and still waited 30+ minutes for a party of 3.  The good thing is that while we waited for a table, we had plenty of time to check out their menu and their specials, so we were able to order once we were seated.  They even provide you with water outside their restaurant while you wait.  As for the food.., it was very delicious!  They use real maple syrup, their strawberry jam has actual strawberries in them, their bacon was crispy and NOT greasy!  Their quality was fantastic, their prices was low, and the quantity was very good.  Other than the long wait for a table, I loved everything about this restaurant.  I will definitely dine here again the next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Visited morning of 10/5/2015. Had the cheese omelet with mushroom and onion, hash browns, and wheat toast. Also the \"Skinny\" I believe it's called, it's an egg white scrambler essentially. Went because they have a big following in the valley. Staff was great, which made the experience, however for the hype, the food was good, if not basic, also everything is very heavy on the oil and butter, making the meals quite greasy. I'm a fan of some butter and cheese but it was a little overkill, we'll give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Not my favorite.... if you come on a weekend, prepare to wait! The food is okay... but the orange juice is phenomenal"}
{"text":"My wife took me to Matt`s Big Breakfast on Camelback this morning. Well, as I always say \" if it starts out bad, it usually gets much worse\". Damn, I was right. First, they seated us next to where they bring the dirty dishes...really noisy and crowded with servers and dishwashers. They should move this station outside the eating area, for sure. I ordered the cheese omelet with chicken apple sausage. The waitress brought me the hog and chick. Not ever dining here, I thought that it was what I ordered. The omelet was definitely not Big, the potatoes were very salty and the chicken sausage was ok. My wife and I ate our meals and then asked for the check. Wow, it was over $37.00 for an omelet, oatmeal and a $5.95 Five Spot. When I asked the waitress, she said that the cheese was $2.00 extra and the sausage was a $4.95 upcharge. What a ripoff and not Big like the name says at all. The waitress asked me to speak to the manager and at 1st, she reduced the bill by 20 cents...no typo...20 cents and she told me that it was organic and the sausage was locally obtained. Who cares! It was overpriced and not all that tasty. To top off the experience, I have been sick all day since leaving the restaurant and think that I got food poisoning on top of a lousy meal. First and last time to Matt`s Big Breakfast!!"}
{"text":"This place is truly THE BEST breakfast spot. My daughter and I drove 45 minutes just to try it out and it was more than worth it. It has a nice vibe and a welcoming hello when you walk in. I had the Tuesday Special, biscuits and gravy with eggs and home fries plus I had a side of bacon. My daughter had the Hog and Chick (eggs, sausage patties, hash browns and toast). The biscuits and gravy was the best I've ever had, the bacon was delicious, I don't normally like sausage but the sausage was amazing, the hash browns and home fries were perfect, the toast is apparently delivered daily and it's wonderful. Oh, and the fresh squeezed OJ and lemonade was actually FRESH SQUEEZED! Our server was great and the managers were all friendly and made sure our visit was perfect!  I will definitely be back, especially on Tuesday's for the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Blink and you might miss where Matt's Big Breakfast is located. But don't let the small size of this breakfast hot spot fool you, nor let the long wait deter you. Matt's had been right around the corner from me, and I had no idea until today what I had been missing out on. A group of friends and I all sprung for the daily special of scrambled eggs incorporated with hot links, white cheese, and peppers paired with delicious home fries. So while the wait, especially during a blustery summer day in Phoenix may make you want to stray, don't, and you will be in for a treat!"}
{"text":"This place is so overhyped. The food is your average breakfast food at a premium price you pay because it was featured once upon a time on TV. The service was even more laughable as the last time I visited I had to actually get up and ask for the remainder of my order. And don't even expect to be able to just pop in and out like a normal breakfast joint, the wait times along ensure that you will be there for at least an hour or more."}
{"text":"Well I was underwhelmed! However the toast, and the strawberry preserves are the best I have ever had. It was good but the wait was long. I was a little disappointed because I was expecting more with all the hoopla surrounding matts. To be completely fair if there was not as much hoopla surrounding matts I'd rate it higher. it is an above average breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Had a relatively high expectation. Got disappointed fairly quickly. Waited about 20 minutes and sat close to the entrance. No problem, no big deal. In fact, I expected us to wait before being seated.   The daily special ran out right after I ordered and lot of the things were out by 11am. I understand the business is doing well but you really cannot allow things to run out more than few hours before close! Sad. So instead of the pork chop and the daily special, we opted for the waffles and the 'new - updated' daily special.   I guarantee that this place is much better than Denny's. It's ludicrous to compare Matt's to Denny's. Sure it may look similar but the quality of the ingredients and the dishes themselves speak for themselves. But, to me, Matt's wasn't all that special. Perhaps all the hype and media have changed the restaurant a little bit? Who knows.."}
{"text":"Really yummy. I recommend this place. Except they brought out a few tablespoons of syrup in a little cup for my waffle. When I needed more they said I'd have to pay more for it bc it's \"real\" syrup. My hubby and I had a laugh about it bc why not just charge a few cents more for a waffle that comes with enough syrup?  Oh well!"}
{"text":"Meh.... I have wanted to try this spot for a long time. I'm glad I did but I won't necessarily come back. We were seated pretty quickly and the service was quick and friendly.   Cons: menu is very limited and the food, well the food was just okay. Nothing special. And it was kinda overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.  I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.  The waitress was not very friendly,  the hasbrowns were soaked in butter, if you love butter you will love it.  The coffee and homemade jam were both good.  None of the wait staff seemed happy to be there.  They really needed someone at the door directing people."}
{"text":"Tuesday, 1:00PM.  Caught them dealing with a rush. For those ordering pickup, there was a slow moving line. For those dining in, there were delayed orders. Poor customer rep at the register did her best to handle the wave.   Quickie: +Clean +Menu variety  And then...? Actual sandwich was decent. Delay in getting food (+15 min) because of understaffing. Willing to give MBB another go.   ********** Stuffed my face in: 1. Classic Reuben      +Sauce complemented corned beef into savory bursts      -Chips were stale      -Pickle lacked crunch  Constructive comments: *Compost and clear recycling bins *Sustainable cutlery *Streamline system to handle patrons who are dining in and taking out"}
{"text":"Good food, but I felt rushed.  I hadn't even taken my first bite and already received the bill!"}
{"text":"Orange juice is damn good. it's really good. I would argue perhaps the best thing on the menu. Omlette was good, but not the best I've had. It was a little on the soft side and wouldn't have hurt to use a little more cheese. I had to be liberal with the salt and pepper. The toast was cut very thick. One of the highlights was the fresh homemade jam, but you really had to slather it on heavy to have the flavor balance out how thick the toast was with each bite. I would have preferred thinner slices.  As compared to other places I've eaten with \"big\" breakfasts, this \"big\" isn't really that big. It's actually quite manageable, which I appreciate and would return for. The new space is beautiful - very old meets new industrial diner feeling. Love the giant wall board in the back creating a hallway to the bathroom.  No wait when we went, which was definitely nice. Seems like a really family friendly joint."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for the neighborhood.    Great atmosphere and a perfect place for all ages.  Nice patio and inside is very spacious.  Had the tri tip sandwich.  Was a little small but that's alright bc most places serve too much.   We will be back when we are on that side of town."}
{"text":"Just as excellent as the downtown location.   Had the Chick and Chop.  Normally I have to get the nice thick cuts of bacon though.   Sourdough toast tastes like it just flew in from SF.  And the preserves are so good I could drink it.  Wife had flapjacks, not a big pancake guy, We didn't  think they were that special."}
{"text":"Last visit was not a pleasant experience. I was dining alone and carrying a briefcase. I was given a seat at the bar that is ahead of you and to your left as you enter. Not the long tables facing the window. But the smaller one across from that.   There was a piece of scrambled egg on my chair. I grabbed a napkin from the unused chair next to me to wipe it off. I sat down on my newly cleaned chair and put my briefcase on the empty chair next to me and started looking at the menu. 30 seconds later someone informs me they are planning on squeezing in next to me. You are practically elbow to elbow at that bar. So I take my briefcase off the chair and go to put it on the floor (no room on the table) and I'm disgusted by all the pieces of leftover food littering the ground.  I'm not putting my stuff on such a filthy floor. I walked out and headed to Phoenix Public Market. On the way, I phoned Matt's and asked to speak to the manager. I explained what happened, she said that they ALWAYS keep the floors clean, so she doesn't understand how it happened, and would I like to come back and get a to go order ? No. I would not.   I've been here once before and thought the food was pretty good. Although it's really not worth dealing with all the hassle of the long waits, small tables, and sassy help.   It's bacon and eggs and waffles. Not exactly 3 star Michelin fare. There are plenty of good, CLEAN, breakfast restaurants in the city that have the same type of food. So I don't plan on going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Quaint, home-style breakfast place. Visited for lunch after a hike in Papago Park. Ordered the hog n chick with a pancake for myself and a plain pancake for my daughter. The portion size was huge for the hog n chick. I got my eggs scrambled with cheese and the home fries. Both were okay, the home fries had a strong rosemary flavor. Came away from the meal $30 poorer. Could have easily gotten a similar meal at IHOP for much less.... Only difference, thick cut bacon."}
{"text":"My Dad has been wanting to try this place since he saw it on the Food Network. Well, now that he's in town, he got his chance.   It's a great little place to get breakfast. And by little, I mean very little. Matt's is tiny. We went on Tuesday morning, at 10am, and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. The first thing that opened up was at the counter. If you go on Saturday or Sunday, good luck.   Having said that, everything else about Matt's is great. I had some great griddle cakes there. I didn't even have to order a side, those three pancakes filled me up for hours! My dad had the special, which was eggs, sausage, fontina cheese, and potatoes and toast. My mom had an egg and bacon and cheese Breakfast sandwich. No complaints across the board.   The staff does a great job in the small, crowded environment. Each server seamlessly tag teams you during your meal. One person took our order, another gave us our drinks, another our food, and another handled the bill. Somehow they're perfectly organized in what appears to be total chaos!   I'd recommend checking Matt's Big Breakfast out sometime!"}
{"text":"Newer, bigger, modern and just slightly up the road location. Same wonderful food. Matt's Big Breakfast may have lost it's dive-status, but it's still a great place to eat.  The menu, like the restaurant, remains simple and small. But all the offerings are delicious and plentiful. I decided just to go with the griddlecakes. I was left happily stuffed for hours.  Even with a few more tables than at the old location, I'm willing to bet that there's still a big line on weekends, but at 7:30am on a Tuesday, the restaurant was practically empty. If you're around downtown Phoenix during the early morning hours, why not stop in a Matt's Big Breakfast?"}
{"text":"I've lived downtown for 5 years now and never heard of this place until I saw it on 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives'...  Just kidding. I'm a semi-regular. I say \"semi\" because I go in series. I'll go four or five times in a two week period and then have to lay off and hit the gym to work off the 20 pounds I gained. But I keep going back.  Matt uses a lot of butter when he cooks, which makes everything taste better. The fresh made pancakes and waffles are awesome with real maple syrup. The pork chop and eggs is a delightfully dangerous breakfast, marinated in a homemade pesto sauce (the porkchop, that is - who marinates eggs?). The thick cut bacon strips are great for breakfast and even better in the BLT (which I sometimes order with a fried egg on it for breakfast, a BELT).  It looks as though most people are saying this is a '$' place but I would give it '$$'. I have yet to leave there with a bill under $10.  Some complain about the wait but I have and answer for that - don't go if you're in a hurry. If you go on a weekend, bring an iPod or something to read while you're waiting."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Awesome portions and variety. I literally spent over an hour eating here because I had to savor each and every bite of the deliciousness"}
{"text":"I hate when people compare restaurants, but I'm gonna do it. Matt's is in many ways the opposite of Snooze - it's quieter, the menu is simpler and pretty classic. I loved the decor and fresh flowers in the tables, it wasn't too trendy or trying to hard. You seat yourself. It has a very small business feel to it. The staff was friendly and attentive. I saw a manager on the floor all morning working with them. The food was pretty good - again, this isn't Snooze, so don't expect anything out of this world crazy. Think basic omelettes and waffles.  They have a rotating daily special: Monday's are huevo rancheros, another day is biscuits and gravy, ect.  I think my family's disappointment came with the price - they charge a lot for little things. An extra side of syrup cost an additional $1.50. That just seemed ridiculously expensive. My dad thought it was a marketing ploy to make the pancakes a little dry purposefully so you'd have to order more syrup. Dorky MBA family humor. But seriously. A dollar and a half for a little dinky thing of syrup is too much."}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice and hip, but the waiters will try to sell you more things as side dishes to drive the bill up a bit. No harm really, but they can be a bit pushy. Foods okay. Pricing ain't too bad either, considering you're in an airport"}
{"text":"We tried to get to breakfast here 3 times, and this last week we finally got in.  Matt's has moved to a bigger location, and the old location will be for take out.  The pork chop was delicious, along with the eggs, potatoes, bread and homemade jam.  However there is always a wait.  I guess I can compare this to Martannes in Flagstaff.  They have both been written up in A Z Highways.  We were in the area for 2 nights and ate breakfast at Matt's both mornings."}
{"text":"Overall, this was an amazing restaurant! The food was outstanding, and I would definitely recommend the breakfast and hash browns. Another great aspect about this place was the staff, they were so friendly, outgoing and made the experience even better!"}
{"text":"Didn't realize how big the salad was lol but the egg white omelette was very good. Loved the chicken sausage"}
{"text":"This little place was great for breakfast.  Service was great and the food better.  It was paced and the just keep the coffee coming.  Was worth the wait."}
{"text":"REAL food (not the processed crap you find at Denny's).  Super friendly and fast service.  Family owned and operated.  Local ingredients  Great portions.  What more can you ask for?  Oh, maybe a few more tables to shorten the wait.  But that's all part of the charm!  This is my pick for the best breakfast in Phoenix!  SOOOOO delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place seemed like one of the top rated brunch places in Phoenix, so this was the perfect stop for my boyfriend and I to check out right when we landed early in the morning to start off our Labor Day Weekend!  We got in on a Thursday afternoon and there was probably only a 10 minute wait. We started off with their highly recommended lemonades (me with strawberry, boyfriend with blueberry). For the main dish I got their homemade belgian waffle with bacon and my boyfriend got the chop and chick with bacon on the side. We shared half of each dish with each other and both dishes were great! I was a huge fan of the pork chop and rosemary potatoes that came with his chop and chick. The belgian waffle is also a must-try; it was very fluffy and just the right portion size. It is divided into four chunks so it is easy to share.  Service is fast and friendly here. Everything is reasonably priced as well! With our drinks and dishes, our bill came out to be around $35ish from what I can recall. This is a great spot in Phoenix to try for brunch, either at this location or at the airport if you happen to catch it there as well!"}
{"text":"This brunch spot is a MUST go-to either here or their location closer to downtown! I was pretty happy being able to start and end our trip here in Phoenix with Matt's. It's a great Phoenix staple!  First things first, service here is FAST which is very appreciative especially at an airport. They have portable credit card machines they will bring to your table after your meal to pay so three people could pay at once without having waiters scrambling around the small space to run your card, run back to you, then run back to the table to pick up the tip receipt.  We got sat right next to the waiter station and our waiter was very attentive and fast. I got the chop and chick this time because I really liked the pieces of pork chop I stole from my boyfriend last time ... :P and he got the breakfast sandwich. Instead of the lemonades, he got a bloody mary and I got a mimosa in a stemless wine glass.    I would say quality, service, and prices are the same at both locations we went to. This would probably be the definition of a good restaurant to try out at the airport here."}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of breakfast (who isn't?) I got really excited when I found this place using my handy dandy Yelp app on my iPhone. You see, me and 3 of my friends were in Phoenix to see the Dodgers play the Diamondbacks in a big league game at Chase Field. The bad news is the dodgers lost, but the good news is we had breakfast the next day at Matts.   Reading the reviews on Yelp got me way excited to eat there. People were raving about this place as if it was a small piece of heaven on earth.   We walked there from our hotel and Were quickly seated. Our first thought was, 'tiny'. But we liked that about the place. Very cozy and welcoming. Old school almost.   I ordered the pancakes with a side of egg and bacon. I always have to try the pancakes first whenever I go to a new breakfast joint. It's my measuring stick. If the pancakes suck, most likely everything else will also.   After waiting about 10 minutes the kind and very friendly waitress began to bring our food out. One at a time. Over a few minutes. She explained to us that they only had one grill so they would bring out the food as soon as it was done cooking. Again, 'tiny'.   Let me tell you the wait was worth it. The pancakes were amazing. Soft, fluffy, stick to the roof of your mouth goodness. The best pancakes I have ever had. Not to mention the maple syrup was amazing. Top notch bacon and the eggs cooked like my mom made them. I was in breakfast nirvana. My only regret was leaving bits of pancake on my plate. After eating different, but equally amazing, items from my friends plate I was full. I felt like I had let my pancakes down.   As we left the restaurant we did the touristy thing to do and took a picture next to Guy Fieri's image on the wall. And had no shame about it.   If your in Phoenix you have to go to Matts Big Breakfast. There's nothing really 'tiny' about the flavor of the food there.   Oh and the people who were raving about Matts as of it were a small piece of heaven are all wrong. It's more like a bog chunk of heaven if you ask me."}
{"text":"We stayed in Phoenix over the last weekend and Yelp helped me find this breakfast wonder.... Matt's was awesome. Locals wait in line for this great good. Service was fast and efficient, food was great quality, home fries with Rosemary were outstanding, bacon was love in my mouth, and the best part.... Their strawberry honey lemonade. This is legal \"crack\" if there is such a thing.  It was rather loud inside but not annoying for such a small place. Since the weather is so hot, while you wait outside they have refreshing lemon water to keep you cooled off. Had to split checks at the minute and it was not a problem. Definately visiting there again if I ever return to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Simple breakfast, but very very yummy!   We walked in just after 8am on a Sunday, which was perfect - the place wasn't packed yet and we were able to be seated right away. By the time we left (about 9am) every table was taken and there was a wait.    I ordered the belgian waffle with a side of hash browns and fresh squeezed orange juice. Everything was so good!  I would definitely return again soon!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Tempe and decided to stop by because we saw the place in a TV show.  The place is a bit hidden but very cool, staff was extremely attentive and nice. The best of all was The Classic Reuben, Just amazing combinations of flavors that I absolutely loved! Their waffles look very good too but I just had no room to try it... The rash browns are made in a very particular way, I also loved it!  I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"They are really good. I recommend them. Not the best I've had but better than most places in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"MBB is one of those places that I really like, but can't really explain why. Maybe it's the fresh jam, the perfectly cooked bacon, the cute old fashioned style of the place or  the fact that you tell yourself it just has to be great if everyone else is willing to wait in the desert for up to an hour-ish to have their hand at some..I dunno.   It is indeed tasty, and I've yet to try anything that disappoints, but the menu (in my humble o-pinion) doesn't really offer anything extraordinarily fantastic enough to warrant the wait. That said, if ever I drive by the place in the a.m. hours and happen to see that there's no line, I will consider it my lucky day and likely mosey on in."}
{"text":"Excellent farm fresh breakfast! You will pay 2$ extra than what you would at Denny's but you won't get homegrown, good for you taste like this at Denny's.  Service is genuine and quick. The food itself is phenomenal. The eggs are fluffy, the browns crispy, and my sausage spicy. Throw some hot sauce on it and it's for the win. I might've downgraded them for not having Chalula, but Tapatio isn't far off, so I'll let it slide. They buy their meats from the best butcher in town, Shreiner's, located right up the road on 7th st. Everything is local bought and preservative free.  Get yerself a Big breakfast with Matt and co."}
{"text":"I was there around 6am on the Sunday before Thanksgiving. It was quiet and my server was a delightfully friendly guy. The food came out hot and super fast since they were fairly empty. The server, whose name I have forgotten, even filled up my water bottle and packed me a complimentary to-go cup of coffee. I think the prices are reasonable for freshly made food; just watch out for those drink peicee"}
{"text":"I have been to hash brown heaven. When I order hash browns I usually have to specify that I want them extra crispy otherwise I get a lump of anemic grated potato.  Not at Matt's.  They know what kind of hash browns this girl likes - a good crispy crust with a creamy almost mashed potato-like interior.    I also ordered the waffle and bacon.  The waffle was light and fluffy and very tasty with the real maple syrup.  The bacon was thick cut and had a delicious peppery exterior.    Now, if only I could get them to open one up in San Francisco."}
{"text":"Daniel the waiter is personable, professional, and genuine. The other servers and service less than fair/ok. 8 minute wait to be acknowledged, 15 minutes for meal was understandable as I asked for well done bacon. Manager on duty looked like he just rolled out of bed (untucked shirt and beach shoes).  My bearded waiter was more concerned with counting the cash in his pocket wallet than seeming customers as more than a potential tip. Check boxes for service checked off but interactions were not genuine."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito!  Great service from the \"Lisas\".  Good spot to kill some time on a layover.  Seriously, the breakfast burrito is delish.  Grilled with just the right amount of spice. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks and a bite in between flights. Great service, excellent food!! Erika was an amazing bartender/server! Had a tasty breakfast joined by a couple really good Bloody Mary's.  A definite must stop when in terminal 4."}
{"text":"Start off by saying vague options for breakfast....service semi-okay...when order brought to table not complete and never did the rest come out....ordered BLT in which the bread was really hard to bite and bacon more undercooked then I prefer. My husband however did enjoy his eggs Benedict and recommends!! Unfortunately the worst part was when we got to the counter and asked for our bills to be separated due to Meals being granted by my work the server said he is unable to do that and has never had to do that. Which  I felt is very poor customer service and that should be something that the facility should do when asked especially since it seemed as though many diverse groups of people go In there and don't pay off one check!! Maybe better service next time will get you more stars!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday morning with the boyfriend to eat and was greeted by a girl who looked like she just got to work after a night out At the club. I couldn't decide what to eat from their huge menu of 7items. The night club waitress informed us that the eggs benidict was the special today. So we ordered one each. Low and behold the plate was 11dollars each. I wouldn't have minded paying that if the food was good but it wasn't. Small portions and incredibly salty. Just terrible! I couldn't even eat my food. I wouldn't even go back if someone paid me. Maybe the people there should pay more attention to the food instead of trying so had to be hipsters."}
{"text":"I had lunch there last sunday me and my wife had a great time good service great food cant wait to go back there again"}
{"text":"Best bacon I ever had. Eggs were cooked perfectly to order. Great pancakes sour dough bread and hash browns. Coffee was fantastic. Can't wait to go back next time I'm in town! Atmosphere was awesome as was the service. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Sixth \"meeting\" for The Breakfast Club UYE, and my second time attending. Oh come on  . . . meeting?! \"Our Meeting is Eating!\" Stick it on a shirt already. Also my first time at Matt's.   We had to wait for our entire party to show up, fourteen total. Staff was very accommodating of us and ended putting several tables together for us.   On Jennifer O.'s suggestion, I tried the waffle with bacon. It didn't leave me with that carb hangover feeling you often get from waffles and pancakes, which was great seeing as I had to get to the gym shortly after. Real maple syrup; just the right amount for me. Watch out though, if you like a double dose, extra syrup is $1.50.   The bacon was what bacon should be: Thick and delicious! A little on the peppery side, but can you really complain? It's freakin' BACON!   For a place as well known and busy as Matt's, our dishes seemed to come out rather quickly. But as Preston S. and many others have mentioned . . . this tends to happen at the Breakfast Club. A lot. :)   No split checks, but we were all able to pay out our amount at the end with no issues.   No frills breakfast, but quality for sure. I will be back!   Shout out to Monica O. for orchestrating this whole thing!"}
{"text":"Great place food was good as well. There's a bit of a wait, but it's well worth it. Try the specials, you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"*Warning - devoured the food before any pictures were taken*  Just flew into Phoenix from Detroit last night and already knew we had to come to Matt's Big Breakfast this morning. I found out about this place from Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and had to try the famous Chop & Chick. Splitting this between two people and then adding a side of the chicken apple sausage was definitely enough for both of us!   Although the service from Gabby was great, I was a little disappointed with the size of the pork chop. It wasn't as big as I was expecting, but it was still delicious.   All in all, I will still recommend this place to anyone that comes to Phoenix. I'm kicking myself now that I didn't get more sourdough bread for the road because it was that awesome."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened but Matt's Big Breakfast on 32nd St it is NOT what it used to be.  We used to love their food and service on a Sunday Morning.  This time the quality of the food has dropped and the service wasn't the expectant smiles from servers we always received in the past. I ordered the Chick and the Hog and the bacon was undercooked and my wife's was also undercooked. The coffee was way too strong and when my wife got to the bottom of hers there were coffee grinds on the bottom. I couldn't even finish mine.  The service was a mixed bag, also. The hostess while friendly and smiling couldn't keep straight which customers arrived first to seat them in order. Then our unsmiling waitress took our drinks and order but never came back once to check on us. She even had another waitress bring us the check. I hadn't even complained about any of this until the 2nd waitress arrived with check and all I mentioned was the coffee. She did take that off the bill so Yay for them."}
{"text":"Daniel and staff were great! Additionally the food was phenomenal! If you work in the area or are just stopping by I highly recommend Matt's Big Breakfast. The manager Jason stopped out after I received my food to make sure everything was great and it was!"}
{"text":"For the price, this place is a very good deal. Food was delivered quickly, was hot and service was very attentive. Portions were large and tasty. Concierge at the hotel recommended we try it. Said it was one of the best in town. The ambiance is equivalent to a subway station, when there are trains on the track. It was loud, VERY LOUD. It is a rickety kind of place that I am glad I tried."}
{"text":"My husband looked this place up & was determined to eat breakfast here soon as we landed!! It did not fail us!! The breakfast was so good & it was a lot of food!!!"}
{"text":"12/10/09 Finally had the chance to take Mom in to enjoy breakfast at MBB!  I tried taking her here once, but the line out the door was ridiculous; Even today there was a bit of a wait, and it wouldn't have been so taxing if it weren't so cold!  (We arrived at 10:15a, sat down at 10:45a, and had our meals delivered at around 11:10a.  Again, the wait times wouldn't have been so bad if my Mom wasn't due to be at the airline gate at 11:40a!) Mom ordered the 3-egg salami omelette and hash browns w/ cranberry-walnut toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ?select=-gdeqfSkpFBnCfkRo3Lcng#-gdeqfSkpFBnCfkRo3Lcng, while I had the ham steak, hash browns, eggs (over-medium, please!), and whole-grain toast.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ?select=OCEqJ846dKKtI2TLJ3mg5Q#OCEqJ846dKKtI2TLJ3mg5Q  (Let me just say that we both LOVED the cranberry-walnut toast!  Is it MJ bread or from Simply Bread??  I've got to get a hold of some to have at home!)  I enjoyed the ham steak and the hash browns were wonderful, as always.  Eggs are always delicious here- aren't they from local Hickman Farms?  Mom didn't enjoy her omelette so much- too much salami!  I don't like salami, but I tried a bite anyway.  Yep, I STILL don't like salami...  However, she did enjoy the eggs, after picking off most of the meat, and the bread w/ the plum jam. I'm always happy when my Mom enjoys herself at a restaurant that I take her to, so thank you MBB for helping her start her vacation right!"}
{"text":"Great place !! Friendly service . Managed well .. Food was great !! A must stop in Phoenix for breakfast"}
{"text":"- Service disappointing. Irritated host around my request for a specific table. Server dripped coffee on my leather jacket; didn't seem too concerned, but did bring napkins after I already used the napkin on the rolled silverware to clean her mess. Table was ridiculously wobbly; there goes more coffee into the table. Good thing she brought clean-up napkins already.   - Food disappointing. Lemonade tasted like dirty dishwater; replaced with coke which tasted fine. Ruben sandwich was a let down. Grilled bread was not well grilled; more of a greasy, un-browned mess. Corned beef was a little scarce, especially for the price.   - Overall impression. I've heard good things about the MBB downtown but only had the patience to wait in line once in my life (my recollection was the breakfast was...ho hum). This was the first I've heard of MBB in the airport. It was generally disappointing and I wouldn't go back if I had other options. Also based on the Reuben, the place clearly shouldn't be called Matt's Big Lunch.... Final tip - there's a Wendy's two shops down."}
{"text":"Ok, I've seen all the positive reviews on Matt's Big Breakfast and had to try it out.  I've never been to the original location, so this was my first time eating here.  At first I have to admit I thought that this just might be a lot of hype.  Just another downtown hipster joint with over priced food.  Man I was way off when I saw the menu and eventually received our food.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich and the wife ordered the waffle and bacon.  Man both were really really good.  The bun for the sandwich tasted like it was freshly made, and the bacon was great.  I ordered it without onions, and sadly didn't order the home fries so I'll try that next time.  I tasted the waffle and it was fantastic along with the thick cut bacon.  The syrup was very tasty and real butter was a nice touch.  Even their coffee was good.  We had great service and were lucky enough to get seated right away.  I really enjoyed our breakfast and for 2 it was right around $20 bucks.  I'm not a real big fan of eating out for breakfast so for me to give a breakfast place a high rating is something to say.  I'm glad I finally tried out Matt's."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place, the salami scramble is amazing and the berry jam that you get is delicious....  If you are leaving out of the Phx airport out of terminal 4, make sure you get there early enough to enjoy Matt's on your way out of town.  If you are a local, then enjoy it daily downtown.  Get there early or you will be waiting at least and hour to eat..."}
{"text":"It's obvious you guys love what you do! The portions are plentiful, served up fresh and extra hearty.   They have a daily special- My fav is the jalapeño & ham scramble with home fries on the side OR the chorizo scramble.   If you're skipping b-fast try the burgers here they're uhhhmazing, along with the chili, it should not be missed!   Did I mention the pancakes? They will change yo life ;)   It's definitely worth the trip downtown, stop by and support what is probably one of Phx's best local Mom & Pop breakfast joints around."}
{"text":"WOOOOOOOOWWWWWW!!!   I FEEL LIKE I'M TAKING CRAZY PILLS!!!   What are all of these people doing giving such high reviews???   Once a month, I meet up with my ladies. But after one of our foursome flaked, it was me and another femme with our name on the list for 3.  (We were waiting for drunky who probably slept in).  We went to the brand-spankin' new location which is apparently huge with a whopping 9 whole tables!!! (It could be more, but I am not exaggerating, I can only remember 9) We waited for 20 minutes in the waiting area, and our friend was still not there (suspected hangover) but they called our names and we were seated.  Our lovely young male waiter came along and we ordered drinks and told him our friend would be along at any minute.  He said no worries and would be back with our beverages.    Let me start off by saying I NEVER go to breakfast joints because I do not eat eggs.  No I'm not a vegetarian or vegan, I just hate the idea of eating a fetus.  That's all.  Unfortunately that left me with one or two options with the VERY egg heavy menu... A Waffle meal, a side order of sausage or juice.  Bring on the waffles!!!! We wait, and wait, and wait for our slacker friend for ten minutes. During the ten minutes waiting for our friend, it began to get PACKED at the front door with foodies glaring at our horrible twosome, for taking a four-top. HOW DARE WE!!!!! Don't blame us for where the hostess seated us?  After 10 minutes, the hostess walks over and asks us what the hold up is.   ?????   I'm sorry are we not shoveling down your \"BIG BREAKFAST'S\" fast enough for you?!  We politely stated, that our friend was going to be there any minute (she was, she was texting us that she was down the street).   THEN THE HOSTESS SAYS (verbatim): \"I'm sorry we're not supposed to seat parties until everyone is here. You're going to have to order right now.\"  ???  Appalled, and not willing to fight, I say: \"Okay, well I guess we were both getting the waffles and Britney will order when she gets here\".   THE HOSTES REPLIES: \"Unfortunately I'm going to have to ask you to order for her, or we wont be able to accommodate an order for your friend.\"  I giggled thinking she was joking.  She stared blankly at me...  WHAT??????????????  So you're telling me, that we gave you our name and our party number, 3.  You saw two of us even though your little notebook clearly said 3.  You sat us at a large table leaving the masticating buzzard hoard to wish us dead. We've been here for ten minutes when most brunch places expect you to wait at LEAST 10 minutes before ordering.  We cannot enjoy our drinks or reading the menu without feeling harassed. We have to order before our friend OR ELSE. THEN YOU TELL ME, that you will not serve a paying customer because she will order 5 minutes after us???? That's a joke right???   No joke.    (I smiled while all of this was being screamed at the hostess from my angry brain)  I tried to text Brit, but as she was parking she didn't get back to me quickly enough so we decided to order 3 Waffle breakfasts and hope Brit wasn't allergic to anything in the meal???  Luckily the second the food came out she was there and she enjoyed her waffles.  I with a bad taste in my mouth from that did not enjoy anything after that experience.  Separate and apart from the hostess being a B, the waffles were decent, but not 4.5 stars decent. I would give a solid 3 for those.  Our waiter was clearly embarrassed that we were being blamed for the hostess's mistake and told us that we should take our time and enjoy our breakfast. I wish I had gotten his name because he was the only redeeming factor for this place and why it is getting 2 stars instead of one.  He is white, skinny, 20-something and really chill and relaxed. Nice guy.    I will not be returning and will find another breakfast place just as good in Phoenix, like I have all over the valley.  Plus, with more egg-less options as well!  This place has Pizzeria Bianco syndrome where they think their food is heaven sent and give you garbage service because you should be thankful they even gave you the right to eat there.  No thank you.  The bill was appropriate, not exorbitant.  But if I want to be harassed while I eat my breakfast I'll eat with my parents.   Thanks but no thanks Matt, I wish ye well. But perhaps with a better hostess."}
{"text":"Besides the fact that they are using cage free eggs and all natural chicken, pork and beef, I'm not too sure what all the rave is about. I wasn't impressed with the service or the food. It's actually really basic and there's not really much to choose from the breakfast menu. I ordered the cheese omelette with onions and for some reason the whole thing was super watery. I get there may have been a little oil or something from the onions but watery eggs are not really appetizing. I couldn't even finish my plate. My boyfriend ordered the pancakes, which aren't anything special or fluffy like other breakfast places we've been to. It's always so busy here so it's more like an assembly line and I feel like the servers are trying to get you out of there so they can seat more people. Don't come here if you are a slow eater or don't want to wait longer."}
{"text":"Sorry fellow yelper's, only 3 stars for me.  This place was good. Was it great? No. Was it awful? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Sure, I just won't wait 45 min for a table.   Maybe I ordered the wrong item. I don't know. I'm a sucker for pancakes and waffles, and I didn't order them. Apparently that's what this place is known for. I got eggs/sausage/potatoes/sourdough toast. It was good. Nothing out of this world.  Workers were nice and food came out in timely manner.   Again, this place isn't bad, it just isn't \"OMG I HAVE TO EAT HERE EVERY TIME I COME TO PHOENIX\"..."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal here....that sums up why it is so popular and you always have a wait.  I try to come here early during the week before all the Central Phoenix Millennials wake up.  Anytime before 9am is good, ha ha.  Parking is tough if you dont get a spot behind the building.  My favorite is the bacon and eggs...simple but the bacon is more like a steak!  The potatoes are just awesome, with all the herbs they are so flavorful that I am craving them now as I right this review.  The place is larger now that they moved a block away and very nice and modern inside.  Highly recommend visiting here before you die...and not on the weekend."}
{"text":"What a great find at an airport location . Gone are the egg mcmuffin and breakfast burrito meals. Matts makes everything fresh and quick onsite . Simple fried egg, bacon , cheese and grilled onions on a soft potato roll makes an unbelievably tasty irresistible sandwich all day . I guess airports are improving their food offerings and places like Matt are making it into reality. If you are at Terminal 4 at sky harbor don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Truly, a Find. Delicious, simple, ample, well prepared food. Thick, juicy pork chop with fresh eggs, house made thick toast and house made strawberry preserves. The rosemary home fries are the best I've had anywhere. Great staff all around- Alexas is a joy.  Already considering returning for a late lunch."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The menu selection is small. Their dishes are basically breakfast meals that I can make at home. Unfortunately the eggs benedict and special kinds of scrambles are only made once a week!  Even their waffles only had butter on top with 2 pieces of bacon! I mean cmon?! Throw some other kinds of fruit and whipped cream on there too! But No! They don't do that.  If you want just a simple breakfast, then come here."}
{"text":"Wowzer...seriously...Matt's Big Breakfast is the real deal!  Things to expect:  *You will wait no matter what time you go BUT the line moves fast.  *Their bacon is re-donk-u-lous! Seasoned with black pepper...oh man.  *Eggs are organic and cage-free, score!  *Go with Hog & Chick to get the best of both.  *Strawberry jam is home made and I could just drink it like a fruit drink...so good.  *Friendly service...mostly young kids who are going to school nearby. ASU.  *Inexpensive for the amount of food you get.  *Bread taste's like it's made in house...yummy.  *Coffee isn't life changing but it will do a good job of waking your butt up. *Check out their daily specials it happened to be the one my wife picked and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix for a family reunion: we saw this breakfast spot had more reviews than any other spot. It's bright, cozy& the staff is super dooper friendly. The bacon! Oh my bacon. I had a Blt w/pesto instead of mayo. The mixed berry honey lemonade was yummy! Annnd Chelsea, ridiculously sweet & full of charm. Awesome service! So awesome, that I left my new sunglasses at the table and she came chasing us out to give them to me.   It's only 4 stars because I wish their menu was a tad more extensive."}
{"text":"Everything was great, the lemonade, orange juice, waffles, pancakes, too the fresh jam etc. everything was seasoned very well  and u didn't have to add anything. It's really not geared toward large group but they fit all 9 of use mostly kids( 9 months - 13 years old). We will be coming back when visit my family in Arizona!!!"}
{"text":"One of those places where \"nobody goes there anymore\" because \"it's too busy\". Classic.  Waiting around for a table and ordered right away. servers were all very busy so a coffee refill and getting the check was a bit tricky but the food made it totally worth it."}
{"text":"Noisy.  Limited menu.  Controlled chaotic restaurant environment.  Took forever to get a table, so we left.  Went to the Breakfast Club in Scottsdale.  Nice location, seating outdoors, and food that rivals Matt's.  No longer have any reason or desire to go back to Matt's."}
{"text":"100% love this place. I've been three times, all when passing through Phoenix, and I will be surely sorry if this place ever changes. I appreciate their choice to use fresh, wholesome ingredients, and their food is delicious. Amazing hash browns, fresh juice, homemade preserves, great bread! Everything is tops. The only bummer is that it's always packed, but I don't hold that against them."}
{"text":"I would rather have medium poached eggs and wheat toast here... than any dessert offered worldwide."}
{"text":"This is the slowest moving airport restaurant I've ever been too. The employees do not seem to care that there is a line of people waiting to check in as they are standing around joking and laughing. After flagging someone down because we saw an open table we were finally seated 15min later only to be told the kitchen is running 35-40 min late. Under normal circumstances fine, but this is an airport where people need to catch flights. We had to walk out because after the wait for the table, and after the time it would take to order and settle in when we finally would have received our food we would have had to leave to board. They could have told us before we waited for 15 min that the kitchen was behind but they did not.  So now I have two hungry small children unable to eat before a long day of traveling."}
{"text":"This place is definitely very popular, but I think it's a bit over-hyped. We went on a Saturday morning around 11 am. The estimated wait time was approximately 30 minutes for a table for 2. But we ended up waiting 45 minutes. :( During the wait, no one bothered to come by and refill the empty water dispenser for all the customers waiting in the Arizona heat. When we finally sat down and got out food, I would say it as pretty average. The only food item that really stood out was the homemade blueberry jam, paired with your choice of toast. This place is nothing special."}
{"text":"Ordered the chop and chick. It was good! Very filling breakfast. I just wish the pork chop had a little more flavor. The hash browns are AMAZING. Blueberry lemonade is not bad. My friend ordered a butter burger and he also wished it had more flavor. No wait on a Monday morning. Good place"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place!  1st timer here  The long wait is definitely worth it people! ( only waited for about 20 minutes )  I had the scramble special and it was delicious! Home made strawberry jam is AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites. I travel for a living and I always stop here when I can. Coffee is great and the service is always friendly. The waffle is my fav especially with the thick cut bacon. Give this place a try, I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, great food. I got the five spot which was amazing, great bread that was soft and made it easy to eat.  The home fries  with fresh rosemary had great flavor too even though I usually prefer crispy hash browns.  Coffee was fresh and yummy too!"}
{"text":"Came in for some breakfast with the bf during our weekend escape to Phoenix and we were not disappointed! We arrived early enough to not have to wait more than 5-10 minutes for a seat, which was amazing. We had the best service by the ladies working the counter and the food was cooked ridiculously fast by my LA standards! I ordered the waffle with bacon with a side of egg whites and fresh OJ, Totally hit the spot. Tried a bite of my bfs pancakes, wow! Best pancakes I've had in a while. A definite must visit for foodies looking for a straightforward American breakfast!"}
{"text":"Overpriced tourist trap. Save your money and have breakfast at Lux or The Market by Jennifer."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I ate here before boarding a flight.  It was packed with people and for a good reason. The food was worth the wait and cost. Which really wasn't bad for an airport. Our food came out fast and fresh. No waiting for slow service. These people have it together. Both of our dishes were very tasty. We each had Matt's Biggest Breakfast. My eggs were perfect and I'm hard to please. I could have eaten more and wished I did, since it was a wait for dinner as we missed lunch traveling.  The coffee was great by the way."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast yesterday, the food was decent, I didn't like the home fries, they had a overload of rosemary on them and the waiter told me they couldn't be cooked without them because they come like that, so I switched to the hash brown, they were really good with tons of ketchup. The pork chop was really good, better then I expected, the egg was egg, and the coffee was ok. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Perfect time to come and no line out the door. Great service, delicious specialty foods and cool temperatures. Hell Yeah!"}
{"text":"Always busy and always an excellent meal. Came here for a late breakfast a few weeks ago and was not disappointed. Ordered the hog & chick, scrambled eggs, bacon and hash browns. All was delicious and extremely filling (needed a nap afterwards!). Would love to come for lunch one day and try something different.   Also, the airport location makes an outstanding bloody mary!"}
{"text":"Great local breakfast spot that is a fan favorite for out of town guests. Plan on getting here early or waiting a bit because it is not the largest restaurant and it gets very busy during peak times. They have always changing lemonade flavors that are fresh and delicious as well as daily food specials. This past visit I tried the \"hog and chick\" which comes with two eggs, either country sausage or super thick cut bacon, and either hash browns or breakfast potatoes and toast. The sausage comes in link or patty form, I ordered the patty form and made a little breakfast sandwich out of the ingredients. The five spot breakfast sandwich is always a great value for only $5.95. If you have some time stay around for lunch, the butter burger and macaroni salad are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Except for the lines, this is our favorite breakfast spot. Great food and friendly service. Can't get much better than that."}
{"text":"Excellent location. Better parking than downtown location. Still the same great tasting entrees that use fresh ingredients. Just mad that it had taken this long to open up! Still has the best bacon in existence."}
{"text":"words can not describe the goodness that is matt's big breakfast. i came out here while on business/vacation and had matt's waffle. i have since been on a tear back here in L.A. looking for a waffle of equal caliber, but to no avail.   light, fluffy, perfectly sweet. i've even contemplated braving the 120 degree + weather just to savor the waffle that obliterates all other waffles."}
{"text":"Look no further for you have located the best breakfast in Phoenix!  Fresh squeezed orange juice, homemade jam, gourmet ketchup, decent coffee, rosemary potatoes, thick sourdough bread.  I ordered the omelette with caramelized onions and sweet peppers with one of three cheeses, provolone. It was divine.  Everything I tried was delicious.  The place was packed and we had to wait, but it was worth it.  The service was great, especially sitting at the counter.  They had 5 different lemonades to choose from.  Two styles of potatoes.  I opted for the rosemary home fries and they were incredible.  I tried my partners waffle with real maple syrup and it was also good.  The jam for the bread was not too sweet and when it combines with butter, you have a real winner.  I only wish they had at least one veggie meat option, but other than that it was perfect.  They moved up the street from their old location. The new location is bigger and more modern, but they have an old school vibe, even down to the salt and pepper shaker.  The counter was concrete with a thick clear coat.  The coffee mugs were even cool.  Simply put, they know what they are doing here.  They have two other locations with one being in the Sky Harbor Airport.  I skipped lunch that day and didn't even miss it."}
{"text":"It was alright.  The prices were a bit steep for the portion (from my perspective), and the food was just okay.  No minds were blown away at my table.  Service was good though and the place was tastefully decorated."}
{"text":"Their bacon alone is worth the 5 stars. So is the strawberry jam they serve with their toast. Oh yeah the egg dishes are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! Very busy place, that's why I had to try it out. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very good traditional breakfast spot. I stopped in just as they opened during the week to make sure and grab a spot.  I was treated with a really tasty plate of eggs and peppered bacon.  One of the biggest pluses, Matt's actually knows how to cook hash browns, I didn't need to order them well done, they come nice and crispy as is.  The real show stealer is the toast and home made jam.  Nicely done breakfast at Matt's, go grab some!"}
{"text":"What else can you give this place! Ernie is the best, most kind beautiful hearted restaurant owner there is. Their food is top quality and delicious and so is their coffee. Ordered milk for the kiddos and it's organic. The bread is so good and they make their  house-made Blueberry  preserves, and their home fries with rosemary are soooo yummy.I can't believe she remembered me. What a compliment, \"I can never forget your eyes\" she said. Thank you Ernie!!! You know how to run a restaurant"}
{"text":"A great experience. They get busy so go a little early. Free coffee refills. The pancakes and waffles were a big hit. I loved the skinny platter- the scramble was awesome. I recommend ordering a side with it though if you have a big appetite. Yummy food, give yourself about an hour altogether though."}
{"text":"The neighborhood is so glad they're here in Downtown Tempe! They 100% live up to the from-scratch hype. Order the Chop n' Chick and a greyhound. (Pro tip: the recipe is actually printed on the wall near the ceiling.)"}
{"text":"Worth the 30 minute wait in 105 deg Phoenix!!  Everything is fabulous! Had the bacon & eggs (Hog & Chick)...absolutely best bacon & eggs I've ever had.  High quality food and I'm not even a breakfast person.  Griddle cakes were fluffy and delicious.  Homemade bread for their toast and fresh farmers market cherry jam for spread."}
{"text":"I was honestly surprised at how small their menu was, but it definitely did not disappoint! The steak my brother ordered was cooked to perfection and my waffle was so light, fluffy, and delicious! Their syrup is pretty outstanding too! The hash browns were perfectly crispy on the outside and the fresh jam/jelly/fruit spread was just the right amount of sweet. The location is kind of a downside - hidden behind&between corporate buildings, but it is a big area and their outside waiting area is spacious."}
{"text":"Yes, we all know about the breakfast....I give it a 4.   Today though, I went in for lunch. Gosh dang, 5 stars, it was amazing!  I ordered the Chicken sandwich - Heaven!  My friend got the butter burger and he claims it may now be his top burger in Phoenix (even over the Chuckbox!)   Homemade chips, toasted buns, garlic pickle, and just perfectly cooked meat."}
{"text":"They say when traveling, go where the locals go and this a nice gem. A little hole in the wall place but with all the people outside waiting to get in, you know it has to be good.  They even make homemade jam for their toast! Nice place."}
{"text":"Yes, I will admit that my family watches Triple D.  Now with that said my wife and I have been to a few of the joints showcased on that show.  As many of you that have started this journey like we have you find killer places and some okay places.  Matt's is a KILLER place.  My wife and I were recently in the Phoenix area for a part of our vacation and planned to stop in for breakfast at Matt's the first morning.  We got there ~8am on Saturday morning and only had to wait about 15 minutes.  Yes the place was small but being the two of us it was not a challenge.  There are about 9 tables total (assuming setup for 2) and 8 or so counter spots.  The food is awesome!!  It was so good we changed our plans and went back the next morning!   Here is what we had:  Pork chop marinated with pesto and eggs with home fries, side of bacon and toast with their very tasty home made jelly.  The pork chop is to die for.  I am a big pork chop for breakfast fan and usually very disappointed.  Not at Matt's, it was tender and cooked perfectly.  My eggs were cooked exactly like I asked for and the bacon is like think slices of heaven!  I had to have bacon both mornings and I am not a breakfast bacon fan usually.  This bacon would make anything taste great!  My wife had the daily special which was chicken sausage, fresh spinach and fontina cheese scramble.  Once again cooked perfect, not greasy at all but with big flavor.  We both had home fries which were incredible.  Nice crust with some rosemary and caramelized onions.  Pretty close to perfect!  The next day my wife had the waffle, which she liked.  The fresh maple syrup was the real star of this dish.  She was kind enough to pass the bacon to me (I know twist my arm).  I had the breakfast special which was a sirloin steak, eggs and hash browns.  The steak was SUPER tender and cooked EXACTLY how I asked (you can tell I do not experience that often).  It was obviously a good cut of meat and had been seasoned very nicely.  The hash browns were very nice.  Crust on both sides and tender in the middle.  Exactly what you would hope for.  Lastly was their toast and home made jelly.  It was like butter!!!  Nothing like your store bought jelly.  I am not a jelly fan but ate all of it both mornings!!!  As for the service it was pretty good.  They were slammed on the first morning but were pleasant.  The family atmosphere really made the hustle and bustle not so bad.  The second time we went in they remembered us and took the time to talk for a few minutes and show their appreciation for us coming back so soon.  Very nice touch!  Overall this now my favorite breakfast joint from Triple D.  Whenever I travel to Phoenix I will plan to stop in.  I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants breakfast cooked the way it should be!"}
{"text":"Loved the food! The location is a little tight though, so be prepared to sit very close to other tables. I wasn't a fan of how clustered it felt. But the food was delicious. Eat the sourdough bread with the homemade jam! Talk about a perfect blend of flavors. I could eat it all day. Ordered a breakfast sandwich and it was great. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The low down: Small Menu , fresh local ingredients, long wait...  Food Ordered : The Skinny (4 egg whites scrambled with gruyere cheese, local organic baby spinach, and chicken apple sausage cooked in olive oil and served with a simple little salad) - the scramble was very good but had a few shortfalls - they were 'skinny' on the egg whites and over compensated with too much gruyere. The simple salad was simply tasty and refreshing.  Waffle (made from scratch Belgian style waffle, sweet cream butter and real maple syrup with two slices of thick-cut bacon) - basic breakfast selection that didn't disappoint.  Overall we were satisfied with the newer location. However, they did not start our experience off on the right foot. There was a 30 minute wait to be seated so we went next door to get a coffee. When our table was ready they told us we could not bring in our coffees but could sit them at the front of the restaurant due to \"health code violations\"  (No such code exists) so word to the wise, if you don't want to waste your $6 Starbucks coffee then I'd skip going there while you wait."}
{"text":"Seriously my first experience was a few weeks back and it was one of the worst breakfasts I have ever had.  I wanted to like this place but our meals were awful.  Very bland"}
{"text":"I went to Matt's today for the first time with my wife.   I was pretty excited to try this place as I heard it was the # 1 breakfast joint in the Phoenix.  Well if this was the best place \"Phoenix we have a problem\".   My wife ordered coffee and it was cold and the cup was cracked.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros special on Monday and it was bland cold and looked like crap on a plate.  My wife ordered eggs & Bacon with Hash browns.   They gave her cold eggs burnt bacon and potatoes not hash browns.  Really very disappointing and I  expected to love the food.   I can't believe the food was this bad maybe they had an off day but it's going to be hard to get me back."}
{"text":"Pancakes were awesome, strawberry lemonade was great. The chop and chick was pretty good, it's why we went. The home made strawberry jam was the star!! We had a miscommunication with the server and my plate was taken prematurely. Other than that, it was great."}
{"text":"I just don't get it.  I have been there twice.  First time was about 2 years ago and both my wife and myself thought it was nothing more than average.  We thought with all the popularity there must be something great here and were somewhat disappointed so decided to try again.  This time was even more of a disappointment.  Somewhat of a long wait.  Then the food:  well if your going there for a standard eggs, bacon, hash browns....you may as well go to Denny's.  I'm not sure what they did to the hash browns but they were terrible and tasted nothing like hash browns.  As for the price I recall being $9 +.  Very expensive for 2 eggs, bacon, nasty has browns and toast.  I always like to give a restaurant a second chance so now I am done with Matt's big breakfast.  Of course there are many other menu items and based on the crowd they always have, they must be doing something right.  I'm just saying that if all your looking for is a standard egg breakfast, this is not the place you want to go."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice location. A little loud inside due to high ceilings and outside due to jets flying overhead."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. The seasoned bacon is to die for! Portions are very large and filling.  Minus 1 star due to Mimosas being $8 and very small (could barely taste champagne), and when I asked for a toast substitute the only thing they could offer was 2 slices of tomato, that's it. (Most restaurants would offer fruit or cottage cheese).  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the greatest little breakfast joint in downtown Phoenix! We stopped here on our way out of town. The staff was incredibly friendly, everyone checked in on us, not just our waitress. The food was amazing. They have a simple menu and are excellent at preparing the food that they offer. The biscuits and gravy tasted great, and came to the table very quickly. We would definitely recommend this place, and will visit again!"}
{"text":"Why go to Wendy's a few steps away when you can get a high-quality, wholesome breakfast from a local diner?   We had a pretty darned good breakfast -especially for airport food. I loved our awesomely sassy server who offered gracious, quick, and efficient service.  I ordered a waffle with bacon (next time I'll get even more of that crazy delish bacon!), which came with real butter and syrup. My husband ordered the hot oatmeal -without the listed raisins- and our server very thoughtfully brought a side of a fruit compote as a substitute add-in, which was perfect.  Including fresh OJ for me and unlimited coffee for him, our total was just $27.  Our server even brought a coffee to-go for my husband to take on our flight. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Picasso. Michelangelo. Da Vinci. What do these names have in common? They are some of the world's most renowned artists... each contributing    their different talents to this dynamic field. There is another group of modern artists who are taking the world by storm and changing the way we do breakfast. These amazing artists are the Matt's Big Breakfast chefs. Two words: pure craft. Breakfast at Matt's isn't a mere quick two egg breaky with some hashies and meat; rather, it's an art form. This experience will change your perspective on what breakfast is and what it can be. I would write a more descriptive account of Matt's food but I would not be doing it justice. \"Art speaks where words are unable to explain\". Matt's Big Breakfast is like a hybrid between Disneyland and the Grand Canyon... a harmonious combination of pure happiness and awe.  Also, the bacon is dumb THICCC"}
{"text":"An hour wait and well worth it. This breakfast will put you into the best food coma you've ever had before noon. When you wake up at 3 pm all you'll be thinking about is the amazing bacon and fresh squeezed orange juice that put you out."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always get the salami scramble with strawberry honey lemonade. ALWAYS. Because it's the most amazing thing on the planet. Just go for it."}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars. Bumped up the rating because the servers were so nice considering how crazy/busy it was.  Small hole-in-the-wall breakfast place. Loved the cranberry walnut bread. Coffee was good. Had the 3 egg, mozzarella, spinach special which was good. Nicely made home fries & hash. Fast but very friendly service."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved downtown and were excited to explore the local breakfast places. Matt's was within walking distance so it was one of the first places we tried. We did have to wait a little bit but they have a nice seating area outside with water for those hot days :-) we were so glad we waited because the food was outstanding! Reasonably priced, fun atmosphere and great food. We can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"It was my friend's birthday and she wanted to celebrate it here and have brunch. Coming here, I wasn't sure where to park & I couldn't find a parking spot so I parked at the visitors parking lot right beside the old Matt's big breakfast ($4 for 2 hrs). The wait was not bad, we waited for 20 mins. for a group of 7. When we were inside, the noise level was very loud, it was busy. Our table & chairs was set up really close together with the other tables so there's no room, we can't extend our feet and arms. I have no where to put my purse so I hanged it on my chair. I ordered the Hog & chick, it was very delicious. The hash browns were crispy, bacon was thick and yummy, my egg whites were perfect and my sourdough toast was very good with their home made jam! I also tried their freshly squeezed orange juice, i love it! it was not too acidic! Service was good they keep up with refilling our drinks and if we need anything else. I love everything!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was really good here. I went just like everyone else because of Diners, Drive-in's and Dives and some other local input. I can't even tell you how long we waited. It was unbelievable. The quality was good and the price was great. I would have given it 4 stars if we didn't wait outside for at least 2 hours. The place only holds like 5 tables so the service better be good. We have not been back because it's hard to justify that length of time waiting to eat."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast this morning and found 2 large black hairs inside of my pancakes."}
{"text":"Matt loves Big Breakfasts and he cannot lie.  (You other brothers can't deny) --Rejected Sir Mix a Lot lyrics  I've had Matt's bookmarked for a long time and had the morning off so we decided to try this spot out. The restaurant is in a commercial building complex almost exclusively consisting of State Farm Insurance around the Tempe Town Lake area. Parking was easier than I thought. Once you enter the Marina Heights garage there's a sign that tells you where customers can park, and the garage offers your first two hours of parking for free.   Once you get to the restaurant there's a takeout entrance and the regular entrance. The regular entrance is a bit weird in that you have to go through the patio to enter the front door.   I had the scramble daily special. It consisted of fluffy eggs, leaf spinach, lightly sweet Niman Ranch apple chicken sausage, and Havarti cheese. You have your choice of potato and toast- I chose home fries and sourdough. The home fries were perfectly seasoned and delicious. I also enjoyed the sourdough toast.  I had a bite of the salami scramble with hash browns. The salami was cut in long chunky strips and tasted good with the eggs. The hash browns were nice and crispy but were waaay overseasoned. It was too salty for my tastes and when we flipped the pile of hash browns over we noticed that the entire bottom portion was totally coated with their salt/pepper mix which explains the overseasoning.   Prices were reasonable for the quality of food we got. I appreciate that they use sustainable and more humanely raised meats, and that to go boxes are in compostable containers.  So if you're in the Tempe Town Lake area and want breakfast, at Matt's, this Breakfast Got Back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in the city. The food is fresh and delicious, the portion sizes are large but not giant, the lemonade and jam are pretty much straight off the tree. And the specials have always been artfully paired and very tasty. I just wish it was physically larger, but that is the nature of downtown.   If there was a West Valley location, we'd be in every other weekend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Fresh, home cooked breakfast with house made blueberry preserves for the yummy while-wheat toast. I had the scrambled eggs with salami - the salami reminded me of our trip to France. My husband had traditional eggs and bacon. The bacon is thick and peppered. I had the famous home fries - potatoes, onions, and fresh rosemary - great flavor an huge portion. I will ask for a small side next time! I hope Yelp updates the address - they've moved a few doors down. Try out Matt's Big Breakfast next time you are downtown in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Sit down breakfast options are super limited in the Phoenix airport and Matt's in generally packed.  I ordered the salami scramble and fresh juice that was pretty good.  Service was okay.  Nothing spectaular, nothing terrible.  OK option if you're not in a big hurry."}
{"text":"Went there today... very good food and good prices with quick and friendly staff. I saw the restaurant on Diners, Drive ins and Dives... I'm from out of town but I'm sure I'll go back this weekend before I leave!!!"}
{"text":"We love that Matt's opened another location! The food is just as good as the original and makes us love them even more. I always get the waffle and my husband gets the special of the day. The orange juice is to die for and so fresh, I usually end up ordering two large Oj's and then one more to take home (yes I know I might have a problem, too bad there is not AA for orange juice addicts)!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere of Matt's Big Breakfast near Tempe Town Lake...however, that's about all I can say for the place. The food was mediocre at best, not even as good as an omelette you might order at a Denny's or IHOP.  They brought us over coffee as soon as we sat, without asking if we wanted it (at first we thought this was a nice gesture, until two coffees popped up on our bill later).  For a breakfast joint located in Arizona, the hottest salsa they have is Tapatio- they don't even carry Chiluba or Tabasco for heavens sake (sacrilegious in my book).  Also, I must say that the menu was quite small; I felt that there were very few options, it was almost too easy to decide which entree to order."}
{"text":"Ok so I heard great things so maybe the bar was set unreasonably high.  Ham on the bone- awesome Bacon- good, great if u love lots of pepper Poached eggs- really good Toast- great Pancakes -awesome Scrambled eggs- average Potatoes- awesome Hash browns- not fresh so oily Extra syrup for pancakes 1.50. Really?  Just charge me more upfront for the pancakes and save me the story about syrup direct from Vermont Staff- awesome Dude at front counter- possibly too much coffee this morning, to tight of a blue shirt, or just an ego issue.  He was not equally not polite to customers and staff.  All in all par"}
{"text":"All yummy food! Make sure you go to Downtown location. Tempe location is not as good as the original. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"What a great place. We were greeted by friendly people and seated in an open air dining room where we enjoyed delicious food! The home fries were stratospheric and they are a must! I had eggs with tortillas and beans with Chile sauce.  Chi chi! Arrival! Que bueno. My son, Ned, had the waffle which he loved. My wife had the bacon and eggs with home fries of course and loved it. The coffee was good! Everything was great."}
{"text":"Kayla Becker's \"Fleek Scale\" (5 being SUPER ON FLEEK, 1 being FLEEK-less)   **5**  SUPER ON FLEEK- This is my favorite breakfast spot downtown. I like that their menu is limited, so I don't have to worry about my indecisiveness getting in the way. I almost always just order the special. If you go on the weekends, prepare to wait, but I promise the lines move quickly.   Things I'd like to see: mimosas and bloody Mary's. My friend and I asked once if they served mimosas and our waitress looked at us like we were alcoholics. We aren't, but if we were, even more reason to slam some OJ and champagne in front of us.   Things I could go without seeing: Since alcohol is not served, I'd assume this spot would qualify as a family establishment. With that said, the waitresses could cover up their tatas. When I ordered biscuits, what was busting out of their shirts weren't what I meant. But your boyfriend might be okay with it.   Overall - love this spot. I crave it often."}
{"text":"Got 3 dishes because me and the boyfriend are greedy like that.  Eggs with salami was truly outstanding. Creative and delicious. Eggs and pork chop were ok. Chop flavor was good but a bit over cooked. Waffle was good, nothing special. Hash browns and home fries both pretty good, not great. Good coffee."}
{"text":"Delish!! I went here with a friend a few weeks ago on a Sunday. We were expecting a huge wait but luckily we just beat the Sunday church rush. The menu is simple, but it definitely works. The waffle was amazing! I personally hate bacon, but even that looked delicious. It isn't just another breakfast chain down the street, it is really about quality food. I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding scrambles!  Great food and friendly service.  I ordered the special - a scramble - which was the best I have ever had.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Before flying out of Phoenix, we decided to fuel up by having breakfast here.  We were drawn to the location based on the number of reviews.   So, we decided to give it a try.    We ate in their new location, apparently, the restaurant was down the block and about 1/2 the size it is now.   The staff/workers all welcomed us with friendly chat.  They all sported vans, skinny jeans, t-shirts and a zip up sweat shirts.  The industrial like environment made conversations bounce off walls which caused it to be loud and sometimes difficult to hear.  But, it was clean and service was FAST!  I ordered the breakfast special.  Our waiter praised the deliciousness of their french toast and apple smoked sausage.  Wow, was he correct.  The french toast was incredible.  The sausage was good.  I normally do not eat pork products anymore, so my rating of \"good\"; I am sure does not do it justice.  My husband does not eat pork products, so when we asked about alternatives like chicken sausage, turkey bacon or Soy; they did not have any.  So, his breakfast choice immediately became limited.  He ordered the cheese omelet.  It was filled with mushrooms, and red peppers.  Potatoes and a side of bread accompanied his dish.  The coffee was not bad; but at the same time left us not thrilled about it either.  So, we strolled a few blocks down to buy some strong brewed Starbucks coffee.  We enjoyed our experience.  If we lived in Phoenix, I am sure we'd eat there again.  However, on our next visit; we'll probably choose another place with meat alternatives and more green chile."}
{"text":"My wife, my 2 boys and myself were in Downtown Phoenix this weekend and ate at Matt's.  We now have a new favorite. Everything we ordered (Pepper Scamble, Griddlecakes, Waffle, Hog & Chick) was the best we ever had.  This place is like breakfast Heroine.  We are addicted and cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am not really sure why I haven't reviewed this place before.  This is probably our favorite place to eat out for breakfast.  While we certainly haven't tried all the breakfast establishments around, we haven't felt the need!  I LOVE the pancakes here!  Hands down, the best I've ever eaten!  I also enjoy the toast and housemade jam.  I remember when this place was in that teeny, tiny spot downtown and was soooo happy when they moved to a larger place...and now new locations!"}
{"text":"The place is so cute and unique. It is always crowded. I crave for their harshbrown. I think theirs is the best I ever tasted! It is crunchy and yummy. My husband loves their pork chop. I recommend to come early because they are usually packed with local people"}
{"text":"Upbeat and urban very much a change of pace from your everyday breakfast & brunch dinner. Staff is friendly and catering to every need. Don't be scared of by the sworn of people waiting outside, good eats await you inside.  Looking for some good pancakes you found the place. Fluffy and filling and don't forget the homemade lemonade."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.   It was the 1st time I had been there and I  sorry I didn't go sooner!   They have excellent food and lemonade and have fast, friendly service.   The bacon is to die for!   Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite place to have breakfast! My girlfriend takes me there every time that I am in town! I recommend the Belgium waffle and their bacon is amazing! I absolutely love this place! They should have more nationwide!"}
{"text":"My Uber driver advised I try this place before I left Phoenix, so I took the recommendation. It was more crowded than I expected but all good places are. I waited for the hostess to take my name down but he kept acting like people weren't standing and staring at him to say hello. After a few times of this a waiter spoke to everyone which saved me from walking away. The hostess still hadn't said a word so I did and just decided to sit at the bar since something was available. I ordered the French Toast an egg and a Mimosa. So GOOD!!! The ladies at the bar were quick and pleasant, made sure everyone was served and would check back frequently. Everyone else and the food made up for the flustered hostess. Glad I got to visit, I'm sure I will be back!"}
{"text":"Come hungry!   The portions are generous.   My husband ordered The Pancakes, nice flavor and very fluffy.  Served with maple syrup.  I used my blueberry preserves from my Toast.    I ordered the omelette with cheese, lots of cheese.  I ordered a side of bacon with my eggs which I expected it to be included in my meal.    The Vibe is cool here!  The crowd is loud.  Good place to meet friends for breakfast, just don't expect anything fancy.    Simple is good.    Servers are quick and friendly.  My coffee cup was always full."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good, a must when traveling to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We found this gem while traveling. This is seriously one of the best places I've ever had breakfast at. I had the omelet with cheese and sausage, served with hash browns, strawberry honey lemonade, thick cut wheat toast, served with homemade preserves, and the pancakes.  -The Omelet was very hearty, I ordered it with sausage crumbles, and hash browns that were super crispy, which I loved.  - The thick cut wheat toast that came with my meal was insanely delicious with the homemade strawberry preserves that was served with it.  - The pancakes were huge, fluffy, and super delicious. I used my leftover strawberry preserves to use as a topping for my pancakes. OUT OF THIS WORLD!  This will be my go-to place, anytime I go to Arizona. I know it gets pretty crowded, we lucked out ND got seated right away. I honestly wouldn't mind waiting. The quality of food and service here will make it worth it. I look forward to visiting soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered the smothered and covered.  The food came out nasty and covered in cold gravy!  WTF!  The food was cold.  The ideas was great, the flavors reminded me of Hamburger Steak with gravy back home in Hawaii.  Also, if you ask for hot sauce, specifically Tabasco, they only have Tapatio!  WTF, cheap hot sauce.  Luckily j brought my own Tabasco sauce to the party!"}
{"text":"I love a good breakfast place on the weekend but...I don't like to drive (and sometimes I don't have time to catch the light rail from Tempe to Downtown) so though I love Matt's Big Breakfast, my culinary dalliances with this well known establishment were sadly, few and far between.  However, to use a cliche, as Mohammad did not want to take the time to get to the mountain, the mountain has come to Mohammad with an extension of this chain right near ASU in the buildup of State Farm and many other places along Rio Salado. As such, I set up a breakfast date with friends, put on my hoodie (it's chilly early on a January morning folks) and peddled over to this location, and it lovely!  Nestled amid a delightful little corporate park, with plenty of space for tables and a long breakfast bar, it is hard to imagine the original and tiny location that is now just a storage space.  One side of the restaurant has glass doors through which one can see the outer area (which is lovely) and of course, when the weather is warmer, they can be opened up for outside seating. As for the food, just as good as the other location(s) with a focus on simply prepared but delicious food. I had the waffle with two strips of bacon for about $9 and added two scrambled eggs for another $3. I also had a cup of their wonderfully strong Joe so make sure to ask for cream if you want to take the edge off.   As it is near the college I'm sure you can get breakfast all day so if your Saturday or Sunday starts when others eat lunch, you are still good. The one thing I don't think they have is any adult beverages, which is not uncommon at many establishments in the Tempe area so something to be aware of if that is a consideration on your part.  Oh, if you don't want to ride your bike there is free parking by the restaurant so you don't necessarily have to park in the parking garage (and I don't know if that requires payment or is free, like I said, I tend to ride my bike in this area). So, go check out their newest location.  I don't think you will be dissappointed.:-)"}
{"text":"Sorry but I really don't get the hype of this place. As you may know from reading my other reviews, my bf and I are poor and like to eat cheap. This is why we consult diners drives in and dives everytime we go to a new city. My bf and I were super excited after a positive experience at Chino Bandido (which was also a DDD recommendation).   I will admit that I'm a little biased when it comes to breakfast food (I hate the majority of it) but the Chop and Chick seemed non breakfasty enough for me especially since I got homefries. They didn't know what I meant when I asked for a soft boiled egg so I got my eggs poached. BF got the hog and chick.   We were so disappointed when our meal came out. The portions were normal sized and everything just tasted ok. The sourdough with fresh strawberry preserves was the only special thing about the meal. I wished the sourdough were more sour though. The porkchop didn't have much flavor and was a little tough. My BF felt the same about his order. We walked out feeling like we would've been just as happy going to Dennys (and then I would have had more non breakfast options too!)"}
{"text":"We got seated right away waitress was polite and food was awesome we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I love this place!   Yes, the wait is long. I knew that going in, so it didn't really upset me. It's not as long if you go a little earlier in the morning.   The service is great. The owners are warm and cheery and remembered me the second time I went in!   The fresh squeezed orange juice is super yummy! Last time I went I got the porkchop and eggs. Mmmmm...."}
{"text":"Love this place. Love this place. Let's talk about the bread and jam. It is to die for. I could eat that as my meal. But every time I go I order something new and it is great. I would recommend everything on the menu. I'm really happy that the moved to a bigger location because I use to wait in line for this food. This is a must go."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was healthy & fresh with homemade jam & amazing pancakes! We will return for sure! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Oh my god. My first experience at MBB was on Good Friday, and it made it an Awesome Friday. The bacon was one of the more memorable things. Thick and cooked perfectly. Oh! And that delicious Honey Lemonade. Such a quaint little spot. Cute, small restaurant makes it feel small-town. The wait wasn't too bad either, but, I haven't been on the weekend yet.  Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"This place had a really laid back vibe that made the experience welcoming! Everyone was extremely nice and everyone was helpful. The food was amazing. Def coming back when in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers, I found this place when looking for a place to have breakfast and all the good reviews were spot on.  The menu is limited but the food is delicious.  The only reason why I don't give it 5 starts is because of space in the restaurant, but other than that, it is a great place and I'm definitely coming back when I'm back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"It's ok, and it is different.  I don't really get all the excitement about, it's novelty food.  I had \"The Hog & Chick\" and wasn't really impressed at all.  The novelty factor going on is a play on the word \"big.\"  But it's not big servings, it's odd cuts.  Instead of 2 slices of toast, you get a single slice that's about an inch thick.  Three strips of bacon that are about double thickness.  To me it was just novelty though, there's a reason toast isn't that thick and bacon is usually sliced thinner.  When it's cut this way the toast was just a bit too much like a mouth full of bread, and the bacon was chewy, not crispy.  On the positive side, the hashbrowns were great, the over easy eggs were done perfectly, the waitress was very friendly, and the service was amazingly fast (Tuesday Morning, 7:30AM).  I'd consider going back for the service alone.  But I wasn't a fan of the food.  It was fairly average, which I guess is impressive for novelty size/slice items?  But I don't get how this can be getting so many 5 star ratings for being great service but otherwise just high priced novelty food."}
{"text":"Everything here was amazing, from the service, to the food! This includes the coffee. From the time I sat down, ordered my food, and received it, it took 10 minutes. The eggs were some of the best I've ever ate. I'll be traveling back to this area in a month, and will be hitting up this place."}
{"text":"Matthew was my server and he was fantastic!  He was prompt, efficient, friendly, and got my order right!  He was working a number of tables and I was quite impressed watching him maneuver and ensure everyone was cared for.  The restaurant is in Terminal 4 so quite busy but they seemed to be turning the tables well.  I had just a couple minute wait but they also have an express option - takeout area - for those that don't have time.  I had an omelet that was very good.  The restaurant itself is clean and comfortable.  The hostess was friendly as was the person that delivered my food.  Good experience all around - which I certainly appreciate when in the midst of airport hustle/bustle."}
{"text":"The Chop and Chix was pretty good. The sourdough toast was huge and thick and the home fries were delicious. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of seasoning on the meat. It's as though they didn't use any salt. The Blueberry lemonade was amazing!! It reminded me of being down South."}
{"text":"I take all of my out of state company to Matt's. Solid, farm fresh, local menu. Thick cut, peppered bacon, housemade lemonades and orange juices and Cave Creek Coffee are just a few of the staples here. Try the chop and chick -traditional egg breakfast, served along a smoked and seared pork chop. To die for!!"}
{"text":"There are not enough words to describe how much I like Matt's. It is the most awesome breakfast place ... not just in Phoenix, not just at the Airport, but it is the top of our list ANYWHERE! We recently had the opportunity to be on a flight that was late and missed our connection causing an overnight ... woo hoo ... we got to go to Matt's for breakfast!!! Great service ... spectacular menu ... all the things we like in a place ... AND good coffee."}
{"text":"As a Matt, and as a breakfast lover this was a slam dunk.   As far as airport food goes, this is one of the better places I've had and with reasonable prices. I think it was around $9 for the Five Spot Platter and around $8 for the egg salad sandwich. Both were big portions and I distinctly remember the bacon in the Five Spot Platter being extra-large, juicy, and thick.   Sometimes, after a long flight you want to get fed and filled up like a dump truck. Matt's will take care of that for you. It was also close to our American Airlines terminal.  Also, it was open late which is a relief because as it turns out there are a ton of options to eat in this airport but a lot of them aren't open late (11pm or later).   I should also shout-out our waitress. She was an absolute hoot. Being from drought-stricken California, I asked for water tentatively. She responded by ribbing me and saying she would have to check if \"water\" was on the menu. All in good fun and she was super attentive even though Matt's was packed. Must be the whole open-late thing.   Very hefty, very filling, and because everyone says breakfast is the most important meal of the day, I would recommend putting Matt at the top of your list of places to eat in Phoenix's airport."}
{"text":"One of my favorite downtown breakfast places.  Do wish they opened earlier on weekdays.  I love the bacon--some of the best I've had--and recommend the french toast, the pancakes.  The coffee and OJ are fine, the service is fine.  Had one dish w/ the hashbrowns--they were so-so..don't recommend them.    But the french toast and bacon are what's worth coming back for again and again..."}
{"text":"Been to the 32nd st location a few times, been to the downtown location a few times....great food at both locations, what I appreciate is the consistency.  Some of my favorite bacon of any restaurant.  Had the Hog & Chick (bacon, scrambled eggs, hash browns, toast).  Everything well prepared and tasty...the strawberry preserves for the toast was good.  Coffee and OJ completed the meal."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fantastic atmosphere. I would eat here everyday if I lived here. The waffle was the perfect and everything was absolutely phenomenal"}
{"text":"Went here this morning for breakfast with a friend. Waited about 10 min to get a table, not long. The honey lemonade was amazing. I ordered the special, French toast... It was crispy, moist, and delicious! I wanna go back next week! Lol   Service was good, food came out timely, correctly and cooked well too.   Prices are average for breakfast place.   Overall I really liked it and being my first time here, now it won't be my last!"}
{"text":"Truly the best breakfast we have ever eaten out. Everything is fresh and above quality ingredients.   The omelet had sautéed portabello mushrooms, thick cut bacon and real cheddar cheese.  Belgium waffle so fresh and tasty served with real maple syrup. The add on hash browns were real fresh shredded potatoes.   Plan on an hour wait for a table but the staff is wonderful and food is so worth the wait."}
{"text":"Please, people! For the love of God, stay home! Do not come to Matt's Big Breakfast.  You will not enjoy the crispy, fresh hash browns. You would not like the weekend specials, such as huevos rancheros with fresh salsa, or scrambles made with seasonal, organic ingredients. A cheese and mushroom omelette will not appeal to you. They do not serve delicious Wildflower Bread toasted with most entrees. The coffee will not be piping hot and the iced tea will certainly not be tasty and delightful.  And whatever you do, please do not order one of the waffles made from scratch. They come dusted with powdered sugar, served with warm syrup and a big scoop of butter. You probably wouldn't like it.  If, for some unknown reason, you found yourself at Matt's for lunch, you would not enjoy the Butter Burger. It would not be served on a delicious roll and topped with gooey melty cheese and a thick slice of tomato. No it wouldn't. The macaroni salad is not an excellent substitute for the kettle chips that normally accompany said Burger.  For the last time, please stay away. May I recommend you get your breakfast on at the perfectly adequate U.S-Egg-Good-Peep, or First Watch? The lines at Matt's are long enough as it is, and the regulars are getting cranky about it."}
{"text":"So this place may be a bit overrated. I arrived around 9 on a Tuesday morning, and I only waited about 5 minutes. I was happy not to wait long, but shocked at the ridiculously small space. Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives really makes it look much bigger.  I don't know if it's my roots in southern breakfast or the mediocre flavoring that caused me to leave this place without much of a lasting impression. The staff was extremely nice, and I loved the fresh squeezed orange juice. Just not worth me getting up extra to include the place in my stops before work in Tempe, AZ."}
{"text":"Get take out or go late in the morning to avoid the long wait. Aside from that, this was the best breakfast I've ever had. Period. The pancakes were perfect. I didn't know pancakes could be this good. The bacon and hashbrowns were equally amazing. You might ask, how can you improve upon bacon, hashbrowns, and pancakes?  A fair question. The answer is, go try it and find out, you slacker."}
{"text":"Local breakfast spot. Awesome. My wife loves the Waffles. I tend to get different things everytime and the eggs are bomb. There's almost always a short wait but that goes by quickly."}
{"text":"Just be informed!!   My Husband and I went to Matt's Big Breakfast in Tempe. After waiting 45 minutes I noticed that several groups of 3 and 4 people, who arrived and registered after us, had been seated and were eating.  When I asked the host if he had forgotten us, his comment was, and I quote, \"no I haven't forgotten you, I just don't want to waste a table on you.\" As he explained, when busy,  all the parties of two are seated at the counter, on metal stools without backs. If he would have informed us of their seating policy when we checked in, we would have politely gone somewhere else. As it was, I was hungry and unhappy. We stayed, the food was pretty good and we are never going back.....Just so you know!"}
{"text":"Overrated, overrated, overrated.  The food was OK, the service sucked, they don't have ranch dressing, and they don't  have any restrooms on site... which is unacceptable in my opinion.  After waiting over an hour and listening to all the people raving about how good the food was outside, I had high hopes. My over easy eggs were soupy, more like under easy, nasty, and the guy next to me complained hes eggs were soupy as well. Something as simple as eggs should be cooked to perfection if this place was so good. The bacon and ham were pretty good, but nothing extra ordinary. The hash browns were soaked in butter and cooked with some short of pepper mix that tasted like crap. The pancakes were just pancakes with maple syrup, tasted exactly like pancakes from crackle barrel, whatever. The only thing at this place I can honestly say was the best I've ever had was the whole wheat toast.   The food was ok. If their wasn't a wait it would be worth eating at, but other then that, places like Chompies and The Breakfast Club are far superior."}
{"text":"Love Matt's! Simple and delicious! Pancakes are so yummy!"}
{"text":"MY GF and I drove here on the Harley. Nice day, and nice ride into town. We got there just in time for a 1 hour wait. We just sat inside and waited our turn and just people watched.  I got the Cheese, bacon omelette with a side of bacon, and rye toast. Omelette was very good, they dazzeled it with Rosemary, that set the omelette off. The bacon is thick as Sunday ham slices. It's also prepared with cracked pepper chucks on the bark (outside of the bacon). Very yummy, I'd go back just to order heaping plates of those slabs of goodness. Coffee was a local roasted bean, couldn't say I liked it, couldn't say I loved it, basic drip coffee, im an expresso man so my tastes are cor stronger coffee. Toast is cut nice and thick! They provided some Blue Berry jam that looked home made, it was defiantly a flavor bomb.  I will be back."}
{"text":"It was delicious! Loved atmosphere, very busy at the time I went on a Friday morning sometime between 8 and 9. Food was fresh! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was featured in Food Network and since I was in town, I thought I'll give it a try.  I got there around 12pm (rush hour) and waited 45 minutes for a table.  The staff was very friendly and helpful but super busy.    Coffee was your typical coffee, nothing special there.  The salami scramble was to die for, the flavor was amazing!  The waffles were awesome, so fluffy and soft.  The bacon was thick but it was too burnt for my preference.  The fresh jam on the thick white toast was delicious!    Overall, the food was excellent and it was worth the 45 minutes wait."}
{"text":"Such incredible breakfast! It loses one star because of the waiting time, expect to wait an hour, but the farmers market is across the street on Saturday so just tell them you'll be there when you put in your name and problem solved! Pancakes are huge and delicious and everything else is up to par :)"}
{"text":"I have friends that rave about this place but because it's a ways from my neighborhood and due to the wait, I just never made the effort to try it out until this weekend. I met up with a couple of friends yesterday for brunch. There was a line when we arrived and I think we ended up waiting about 30 minutes, which was fine and expected, we used the time to catch up. We were seated in the little semi-private room right up front where an old skillet is - very cute. The menu is diverse but isn't huge. Two of my friends got two of the breakfast items I was eyeing and said I could try some, so I got the Big Butter Burger and Honey Lemonade. The honey lemonade is amazing. Something you could definitely make at home but I did not mind paying for that sweet sweet juice. The burger was very good, not extraordinary. I thought I would be fine with the kettle chips but I wish I had gotten coleslaw instead. What blew my mind though was the griddlecakes. OH the griddlecakes. Honestly. So good. And the bacon. Fantastic. Their lunch is good but they serve breakfast all day so just go and eat griddlecakes and bacon."}
{"text":"Everything that everyone says it is and more. Super delicious. Everything was made to perfection! I had the waffle and bacon, my friend had the pancakes. May have been the best pancakes I've ever had."}
{"text":"The wait here is horrible! We were quoted 30 minutes & now we're still waiting more than an hour later! Sorry Matt's but you suck!"}
{"text":"GRANDMA !!!!!! ARE YOU BACK IN THAT KITCHEN?? GET OUT OF THERE!!!   That's basically how I always describe this place.. \"Its grandma breakfast\"... you know fresh, cooked to order, and way too much!   I have always loved Matts and have been coming for many years...the only thing I hate.. the wait.. (well, that and the unfinished, sloppy paint job in the dining room)   The food is ALWAYS great here... their pork products are amazing! Super fresh cage-fee chicken eggs, local produce and hearty THICKLY sliced breads served with a side of strawberry lavender preserves... yummy. If you're not in a hurry and have the time to endure the wait... this place is HIGHLY recommended!   Although my grandma left me many years ago... her breakfast spirit lives here!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 eggs over medium hashbrowns & the Griddle Cakes. My husband had the Classic Reuben.   SERVICE - 2 stars - Waitresses were rude. And were transparently erked when we asked for Non Dairy Creamer. TASTE - 4 stars - Food was really good. But my eggs were over easy not over medium, the way I ordered them.  VALUE - 1 star - they give you 2oz of syrup for an entire order of Griddle Cakes... then charge you $1.50 for every 2oz of extra syrup you order. My husbands Reuben had hardly any meat on it.   OVERAll - 2.3 ... Taste was excellent but service and bang for my buck did not meet, even my most minimum of stanfards.  BOTTOM LINE Will I be going back?... probably not.  Will I recommend to a friend... NO!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was very impressed!   Really wanted an omelette and great hash browns and that's exactly what I got. Everything from the house made jelly preserves, to the organic chocolate milk, I fully enjoyed all the food.  The server was a little slow but I understood because it was a packed house, the lovely manager and food runner with short hair were helping us with whatever we needed and we appreciated it!   I will be back for the amazing bacon however, perfectly peppered and thick, just how I enjoy it!   5/5."}
{"text":"My favorite place when at PHX airport.  The food is delicious, service is absolutely great!  I've spent 10 minutes to 3 hours there depending on flights, and I'm always treated to good food and good service."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing service! We got the Hog &  chick, very good thick pepper bacon that I loved. Ask her eggs over easy, should've said over medium.  Just delicious! Potatoes were amazing! Love the rosemary!!"}
{"text":"I've decided to make this one short and sweet...  The Menu - Too Small. The Food - Good, but nothing special. The Service - Stellar. The Aesthetics - Cute, 5&Diner-ish, CRAMPED! The Wait - Too long & clearly not worth it.  Just because Guy Fieri ate here...Puh-leeze. 2 Stars because I genuinely appreciate a warm and attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"I have stopped by for a breakfast a few times in the past few weeks.  Great food, reasonable prices, and the City of Phoenix parking meters don't start needing coins until 8 am.  The best part of the place?  Chelsea and Torie (Tory?) are the best servers I have encountered in a LONG time; friendly, attentive to your dining needs, willing to spend some time to get to know you, interested in what you as the customer are doing (with Torie it's books and reading, with Chelsea it's career and family).  Makes for a very pleasant eating experience."}
{"text":"After all these years, I decided to see what the hype was all about. Well I can say that I'm right with the rave reviews. From the fresh squeezed orange juice and perfectly cooked eggs to the amazing bacon and delicious preserves, everything was wonderful. Great service as well. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and Matt sure likes his eggs and bacon in the morning hours!  I was actually able to get into their newest location and sit a the bar.  I'm not a big lady but the stools were tiny and I kept slipping off the stool.   The staff and service was great.  She was busy however able to fill up my coffee cup without being asked.  I ordered the omelet with cheddar, mushrooms and of course bacon with hash browns and white toast.  Surprisingly the toast and jam, I really enjoyed the most! The omelet was filled with melted cheese, grilled mushrooms and bacon.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and overall the dish was tasty.   Matt's prides itself for making everything from scratch or most of it.  And it is really good, if you are into traditional bacon and egg kind of dishes for breakfast.  The coffee was actually really good and didn't leave a bitter taste.    I would recommend getting there earlier than later due to Matt's reputation in the Valley. The place does get crowded even if it's in a bigger location.   Next time: Waffles!"}
{"text":"Pros:  - Bacon - taste beautiful  - potatoes - good - Waffles tasted homemade - Toast - jelly taste homeade  Cons  - the wait time. - the butter burger could've been better."}
{"text":"Just found this place on a drive up Camelback Rd.  Great vibe, great food and really wonderful staff. 3-egg scramble full of bacon, spinach and a little cheese...homemade strawberry jam, hash browns cooked the right way.  My coffee cup never cooled down! All this for less than $20..."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast at Matt's on Saturday after moving my daughter into her dorm. It was a short walk away. This is one busy place. You will wait if you have a large party, but I thought it was worth it. Really old brick wall place that has tables and counter service. I had the scramble eggs with bacon, toast, and home fries. The bread and jam are home made! Really good. Bacon was thick cut and had great flavor. No complaints. Everyone enjoyed their meals. I had to finish another one since my wife couldn't."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend Friday morning, it was not very busy. I usually go to the location on downtown, but usually that location is always super pack and the wait is at least 45 min. Food is always amazing here, however the service was not the best. The original location people are super nice and attentive. My server after getting my Oder disappear until she drop off the check, when I was not even done with my food. In my personal opinion I find it a little disrespectful that the servers are rushing you to get out of the restaurant. I hope the service gets better."}
{"text":"Yes you will have to wait. Is it worth it? YES. Today I visited with a friend of mine. I could smell the scent of bacon, coffee which fueled my appetite but I was craving a burger. You know a burger is good when no mayo, mustard, or ketchup are needed. Just the taste os a well cooked burger (side of kettle chips).  Expect a wait, most of the time. Come hungry. Waiting is outside (it is a very, very small building), but worth it. Next time, I will order the breakfast."}
{"text":"Been to this location twice and both time have truly enjoyed my experience. Service has always been great.  The food is simple breakfast done right.    You can't go wrong with Matts Big Breakfast. It can get pretty busy here so if you come during the rush expect to wait 30-40min as it's a small location to begin with."}
{"text":"One of the best parts of my career is that I get to eat around. If eating were sex, I'd safely call myself a whore.  Matt's Big Breakfast isn't just my favorite breakfast in Phoenix. It's quite possibly my favorite breakfast anywhere. Matt and Ernie do it right, and Phoenix is one lucky town for it.  When I work in Phoenix, I conveniently stay just  few blocks away. On my last visit, I made it into Matt's no fewer than four out of the six days I was there.  Yes, you will likely wait outside if you go on the weekend. Not so much on a Tuesday, but perhaps. You never know. It's not important, though. It's so worth the wait. (weight).  Having tried a good portion of the menu, I keep coming back to the \"Salami Scramble\". It's one of those things you may make in your own kitchen and eat too much of when no one is looking. It's exactly what you imagine it is and, when paired with their amazing hash browns, close to perfection.  If you're feeling hungry enough, the Chop and Chick is the way to go. A delicious, well chosen pork chop with eggs. Sigh.  The quality of the food at Matt's is memorable for its flavor, temperature and love which is clearly sprinkled generously on top of every buttery bite.   Big Breakfast. Big Love. Big Belly."}
{"text":"They pull off the dinner, but in an upscale way. Eggs over easy with hash browns and a pork chop...basic dinner food, but better. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the hash browns were some of the best that I have ever had, and the pork chop was flavorful. The toast, that I put under my eggs came with homemade strawberry jam so I ordered a second order just so I could try it...and it too was great. Their prices are only slightly higher than a dinner. The atmosphere was done very modern but with a salute to an old school dinner. I actually came straight from PHX airport and got there before the crowd. I heard my waitress talking to someone else and she said the \"wait\" usually starts around 8:30 am. By the time I left, they were on a wait."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast is hands down the best breakfast spot. The wait can be a little long sometimes but it's 100% worth it once that special comes out. Living in walking distance is dangerous"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Pretty simple menu, so if you're looking for anything fancy this is probably not your spot. This place gets busy so expect to wait a few minutes for a table. Worth the wait and visit!"}
{"text":"The rental car agency recommended Matt's when we arrived in Phoenix on  Monday morning. She said it's best place in town and normally there are long lines on the weekend so we be good time to go. When we drove up there were people waiting outside, which confirmed the fact that it obviously was well loved. After waiting a short time we were seated. It's a relatively small space but atmosphere and wait staff was great. There is a relatively small menu but everything look and smelled great. Ample servings size, quick service and very helpful and friendly wait staff. I had the chorizo and jalapeno pepper omelette with toast and my wife had the breakfast sandwich. Everything was great and the toast with homemade preserves and butter was amazing."}
{"text":"I know I'm gonna make a lot of enemies with this review but here goes.  It doesn't quite live up to the hype.  Having gotten rave reviews from the local paper and from the community in general, always be prepared to wait about an hour to get a table.  The food is by no means bad, but with the exception of their daily special, their selection is ordinary - this took me by surprise considering how many people rave about the place.  On top of this, the service hasn't been great.  The only time we've had decent service was when the waitress was trying to flirt with my friend, which was honestly rather amusing.  That aside, they do make pretty good pancakes and if you do really insist on seeing what the hype is all about, I advise you to stop by within an hour of opening to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"Mmmm I know everyone raves about Matt's and they aren't necessarily bad, but I don't think they are the best as many may claim.  Let me start off by saying, their service isn't great.  I've been to their original location, before and after the relocation, and now this new one, and hardly ever will you get a smile from anyone working there.  And I've dined there when they've just opened for the day, I've dined a few hours in, I've been there around lunch, on both weekdays and weekends, and smiles have always been, and probably always will be a rarity.  On the bright side, this location did care to ask if we wanted refills for our drinks cause the original location definitely did not.  The food is a little on the pricier side.  Though unfortunately, there isn't much on their menu, and honestly, after not coming to Matt's after all these years, I was expecting to see a little more variety on their menu.  Instead I saw the exact menu I had several years back but now with a little printed insert listing the specials of the day for the week.  In my mind, their saving grace at the original location was the chalkboard, decorated with the special of the day.  Quite unlike the regular menu, it was often something interesting, but this insert was less than interesting that I actually gave it a skip.  Note that whenever a friend dragged me to the original location, I would without a doubt, order the special of the day.  With a side of pancakes.  I guess their food isn't bad, but with all the hype, coupled with less than stellar service, and a menu that hasn't changed all these years, I am a little disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Matt's, BUT! (read on)  I love Matt's - the food is amazing! I love that Matt and his wife are so friendly and they always remember me whether I come into Matt's or The Roosevelt (granted, I AM pretty memorable).  However...  The wait - it is out of control. Now I understand why Hawaiians hate mainlanders - because they have to wait at their favorite spots due to clueless tourists!   Here is my solution, and Matt, if you read these reviews, seriously, consider what I have to say because I am in Mensa (not officially, but I would be if I took the test... I'm certain of it).  Set aside a certain block of time for \"LOCALS ONLY\", for example, from 6:30 - 8:30 only locals are seated. How does one weed out locals from the lemmings in Tommy Bahama shirts and cameras standing outside? Easy. You must have a card that is punched each time you eat there, and once you have received 5 punches you are considered a local (granted, the first 5 times you go you will be treated like a tourist, but if it's your first time and you're a local, well hell, you're a tourist in my book). Once said card carrying local is verified as legit, he or she keeps the validated card and presents it from that time on.  Now, I can already hear all the naysayers finding fault in this idea, including you Matt. But here's the truth - LOCALS keep this place humming. Tourists are one time tricks, although they do contribute to sales, it is miniscule in comparison to the long term revenue generated by Phoenicians.   So please Matt, do something that is not pc, but is good for the people that take care of you - take care of them back, get the locals in before Mr. & Mrs. Tommy Bahama. This is an amazing idea, and some restauranteur will read this and do it if you don't, so be the first, be a rebel - locals will love you for it, they will cheer your name in the streets and name their first born after you.   Love,   Brandon  (dictated but not read)"}
{"text":"Awesome foor. Great service.  Prices are reasonable. Worth the drive. Go during the week for shorter wait"}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast was featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins & Drives! And this meant that even though it was a 45 minute wait for brunch, we were going to wait and stick it out. This isn't really related to the food or service but they have a really fantastic mural on the side of their wall. A cute photo op for sure! Anyways, they have a pretty small menu and it's very straightforward. All their lemonades are made with honey too instead of sugar which is an interesting change. We ordered their Honey Strawberry Lemonade and weren't quite sure if we liked it or not. Maybe lemonade is just meant to be made with sugar!  We ordered The Five Spot with House Potatoes (breakfast sandwich with 2 eggs, 2 slices of thick-cut bacon, American cheese, grilled onions) and The Chop & Chick with Hash Browns (2 eggs, skillet-seared Iowa pork rib chop). Now, Guy Fieri actually said on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate that his breakfast of choice is The Chop & Chick. It didn't look too impressive when it came out and it didn't taste all that impressive neither so I have no idea what Guy Fieri is talking about. The pork chop honestly was thin, dry, and pretty flavorless. We didn't like it at all as far as pork chops go. I wouldn't order this or recommend this dish ever. My Five Spot was a little better but it wasn't anything that I could't make at home. Nothing special at all. Just your average breakfast sandwich you can get anywhere. The one thing that really made Matt's stand out was their potatoes. It was seasoned to perfection with herbs and aromatics which made the potatoes the best part of our breakfast. Also the toast and preserves that came with The Chop & Chick. That was also delicious.   Honestly, I wouldn't really recommend Matt's Big Breakfast. It wasn't worth the wait at all and I didn't understand the hype. I don't even understand why it's called Big Breakfast when the portion size was average at best. If I had to dine here again, I would just order their house potatoes with some toast. At least then I wouldn't walk out feeling like I spent too much on some mediocre food. 3/5"}
{"text":"Has the semi-fancy breakfast place finally jumped the shark?   I am not sure, but the lines outside Matt's Big Breakfast were certainly an indication of the semi-fancy breakfast joint has remained popular. But why exactly?  Matt's Big Breakfast has good breakfast, certainly. But it wasn't so much different than typical diner food. I will credit them with some of the best bacon I've ever had: Thick cuts of fatty, salty, peppery bacon. Definitely amazing.  But otherwise: Eggs, slightly too herbal potatoes, some toast for $9.  The menu is also surprisingly small with typical waffles and omelets at a definitely price premium. They even have a bowl of Frosted Flakes for $5. Why anyone would go out to eat and pay $5 for that, I cannot fathom.  If it wasn't for that amazing bacon, I would have frankly felt ripped off and that I had wasted my time in line. That's the problem with a lot of semi-fancy breakfast joints, the hype leaves you disapointed."}
{"text":"Close your eyes, spin the menu, point, and order. You will not be disappointed with anything on the menu. Start with the bacon as your meat of choice though."}
{"text":"Disappointed sums it up. I don't understand why this place is so busy? My pork chops with eggs was average at best. Nice sear to the pork chop but it was dry. Would only go back if any co workers wanted to try it out. I'll try the  omelette next time."}
{"text":"The best jelly I have ever tasted, amazing fresh serves orange juice as well. Always very packed! But hey. The food is amazing!! I recommend the waffles!"}
{"text":"Went to Matt's this morning for the first time. It was awesome!  Great atmosphere, great food, and great service.  I would highly recommend this place but be prepared to wait for a table. We got lucky and got two seats at the counter. Check it out!  It is worth it!!!"}
{"text":"The wait was about 35 minutes on a Monday around noon (party of 2). Food and service was great...we're thinking about going again tomorrow lol"}
{"text":"Im here visiting from CA and wanted some breakfast before starting work. I found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try to to.its amazing reviews.  I walked in and they greeted me immediately.  The  girl behind the bar was nice enough to give me $1 change because I didn't have change for the meter.  There menu isnt large at all, limited options. I order the waffle with 2 strips of bacon and ice coffee.  The coffee sucked but the waffle and bacon were AMAZING! !!   I would definitely come back to try something new:)  I would give it 5 stars if the coffee was better."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast with friendly service and large portions.  Fresh food and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I found this gem on yelp and we are so glad we did.  Not only was the food excellent but the service was stellar. Everyone was friendly making sure food was good and filling our glasses when they were close to empty. As we were walking out everyone said thank you for coming in and good bye. Wow!! We will definitely be back. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing organic local food small business ! They have the same prices as the place they have in town. Hogs and chicks are awesome with peppered bacon the sausage is amazing too. If you order with someone else get one of each so you can share and get both. By far the best dining experience I have had at an airport . Our waiter TIM was outstanding and a great asset to Matt's Big Breakfast! Way to go Phoenix AirPort for allowing local business!! If you go here comment and tell me what you think. Oh ya cheap too $"}
{"text":"I know this isn't really a bar but these were absolutely the worst Bloody Mary's I've ever had."}
{"text":"First time checking out this location.   Went on a Saturday around 10:30am so expected to wait. Manager quoted us 30-45 minutes. Lots of open seating which made it seem understaffed.   Waited about 30 minutes.   Service was meh. She greeted us quick but not friendly. Kept up on water refills but didn't check on us too much after we got our food.   We waited about 20-25 minutes for our food. Boyfriend ordered the special which was a three egg scramble with pork tenderloin, Fresno peppers and Cabot white cheddar served with a tortilla and home fries. He requested home fries extra crispy and they came out super soft. There were two tiny pieces of the Fresno peppers in the scramble and the pork tenderloin was roughly chopped into large pieces with little to no flavor. Pretty bland.   I ordered the five spot with a side of hash browns. Both of mine were absolutely delicious but very greasy. They may have confused the \"crispy\" request for my hash browns but they turned out great.   Took a while for our server to get us our check and a box. Bathroom was out of paper towels. Overall just not a great experience. I'll definitely return but either during the week or earlier on the weekend."}
{"text":"I heard about this place on diners, drive ins, and drives and wanted to try this place for years. So I finally had the opportunity today. I had looked in the previous reviews and pictures and had my heart set on the French toast only to find out it is not on the menu everyday ( it is a small daily menu) needless to say I was disappointed by that. I ended up getting an omelette with mushrooms, onions, and cheddar that came with hash browns and sourdough toast. It was good but nothing to write home about. I'm just glad I didn't have to wait an hour in the blazing sun for it. I would come again.   I came on a Monday morning around 11:30 am. No wait at all probably because of the larger locations."}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Good people. Love the eggs Benedict. I had heard a lot about this restaurant and it has completely met my expectations. Will definitely be back again soon!!"}
{"text":"Probably a little over rated. Food was pretty good but the pancakes were a bit tough. Nice atmosphere and pretty good service."}
{"text":"Seating service was slow for an airport.  Breakfast was big serving but toast came out cold."}
{"text":"As soon as I found out I would be traveling to Phoenix, I began looking up places to eat. Matt's Big Breakfast was the first thing to crank up my Yelpdar!  B R I E F  S U M M A R Y -- Probably the most reviewed/well known place in downtown Phoenix -- Featured on TV like everyone else said -- This newer location is a block further than the old (way bigger now!) -- Warm & welcoming ambience -- Friendly and attentive staff (seems like they have a system) -- I recommend coming early, only 6 tables @ 6:45am (Wed morning) -- Salami scramble was definitely unique but needed some cheese -- Potatoes had decent flavor (rosemary) but I wish I got hash browns -- Waffle was hot & fresh & syrup was high quality -- Sourdough toast was thick & good -- Strawberry preserves were delicious! -- The regular menu is very limited -- Staff recommends trying the specials -- Very sad I couldn't try the french toast, it's ONLY a special! :(  Well I woke up super early because I didn't want to get stuck here and I had a meeting at 8am! I forgot that AZ is an hour ahead of CA. I woke up so tired and barely made it here at 6:45am. I walked from the Westin which was a healthy walk at 6 in the morning! I was a bit disappointed to find the old location but luckily I saw the new location was only a block further.  I really like the feel and ambience of Matt's Big Breakfast (MBB). The wait staff were all ladies and they were all very friendly and attentive even at 6am! I was barely awake and I wasn't sure if I was going to come here again so I ended up ordering basically 2 dishes so I could try 2 things. My server loves the waffle so I had to get it. The special she also recommended but I'm just not a fan of apple sausage so I opted for the salami scramble.   I'm from the San Francisco bay area so I'm almost accustomed to what MBB is doing with fresh, local ingredients. I applaud them for keeping their food quality so high but I wasn't uberly impressed because I'm sort of used to it. I expect to pay a decent amount of money for high quality food. I didn't feel like MBB was overpriced, I thought the prices were about right in my opinion.  The waffle was above average and I could taste the quality of the syrup. I really wanted the french toast but it wasn't being offered. To me, if you're famous for french toast, you should offer it on your menu! Nevertheless, the waffle is a good alternative.   The salami scramble was so unique and different. I've never had anything quite like it but I really wish they would have added some creamy cheese to smooth out the salami after taste. I think I added some ketchup or hot sauce to my potatoes and it helped balance the salami. If you like salami, I recommend. I probably wouldn't order again, I just was feeling adventurous. I was a bit surprised that the sourdough bread was so thick but it was still good. The preserves really enabled me to eat all of it otherwise it would been just too much bread for me.  Clearly this place is living up to the hype as it is the number 1 rated place in downtown Phoenix. I didn't search further than that because I didn't have a rental car or anything. I would definitely recommend coming here and if I'm ever out here again, I hope that I can grab some of their french toast!"}
{"text":"My dad and I went there for Breakfast.  It is a little hole in the wall joint which only seats about 15 people.  The prices are high for the amount of Food.  Three pancakes were $8.00 and they were not big at all less than half the plate.  My dad had a bowl of oatmeal which cost $5.50.  I was not impressed the food was just average nothing to rave about.  Also there is no parking except on the street which has meters and no bathroom you have to go to the hotel next door which has a bathroom.  It is very cramped and hardly any room.  I was impressed they had organic milk on the menu but beside this the food was just average.  I suggest not to make a special trip unless you're a DDD person and want to experience it like most of the customers were when we were there."}
{"text":"If I could just get a bowl of their butter and eat it like ice cream or yogurt, I would. Everything we had was sooo good! I ate every single morsel of food on my plate. Between their house made preserves and butter, I was in heaven! Service was attentive and everything moved like a well oiled machine. Only odd thing, if I can use that word... was that they don't have half and half or cream for the coffee. Only organic whole milk. The coffee was still delicious"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! We chose to go to breakfast on a Tuesday and only had to wait 30 minutes for this delish meal! It was a good time to look over the menu and decide what we wanted to eat. The menu isn't big but everything looks good! Since we were only getting to try one meal at this place, I decided to go all out and get the Chop and Chick with a side of the bacon and a strawberry honey lemonade. The food was amazing. Hash browns all the way! And the bacon...oh the bacon...and the bacon! It was worth it for me to get the extra side of bacon. Did I mention the bacon?   I do have a critique on the lemonade. It was a bit too sweet for my liking. So i diluted it with a bit of water and that made it just right for me. I'm going to have to try other menu items...I'm not a fan of waiting an hour, so it might have to go again during the week to avoid the much talked about morning crowds. You gotta try this place if you are in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Had the bourbon cherry sausage with rosemary potatoes and eggs and it was unreal good! Service was friendly, prompt, and the waiters had  good personality.   If you're a jam lover the strawberry is well worth the price to pick one up."}
{"text":"The waiter Micheal is amazing and makes this place a great place to eat. Keep it going Michael."}
{"text":"Great waitress, good food. But why would you have a patio at a restaurant that you can't eat from unless you have a dog?! Beautiful weather in Tempe...restaurant with a patio...but can't sit out there. What's the point?!"}
{"text":"Visit date: 09/14/14  Can I say the best griddle cakes I have had in a long while???  This was the first for me and my husband.  We try to check out a new breakfast spot every weekend.  I had heard about Matt's from friends and read some Yelp reviews.  I glad we decided to eat at Matt's.  I know there is usually a long wait, which I was worried about since we havea six month old (teething) baby.  We went prepared to wait.  The wait was not so bad, I think we only waited about 15 minutes.    Once we were seated it did not take that long to order and receive our food.  Everything we had was delicious.  I ordered the griddle cakes, country sausage patties and home fries and my husband ordered that days special.  Everything was flavorful.  Our server was great and were in and out of there pretty quickly.    We definitely be making another trip to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The perfect breakfast spot!  This was my irate time and I'm head of heels for it. I had the special: French toast with bacon. Seriously, the best French tat I've ever had! I'm going to guess this has more than a little to do with the fresh, local made bread. Follow that up with some strawberry lemonade and this is the absolute best Saturday morning breakfast.    Oh! And if you can get there before 7:30-8am ish, you'll likely be able to snag a seat immediately. The place is small and popular, which leads to crowds, but that seems to move smoothly and quickly."}
{"text":"I love the interior and welcoming feel of the place. Unlike a lot of places nowadays, the food actually tasted and felt \"real.\" Super tasty! As for the service, you're just part of the family to them. I'll DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed upon sitting down was the noise.  Wow is it noisy!  I will not return as I could not enjoy being there due to the noise.  I could not hear the person I was with, who sat across the table from me.  Everytime someone pushed out their chair, I crindged!  Regarding the food, it was so,so.  I had an omelet with onions and peppers (blah), chunk potatoes hash browns (they were overly peppered), and sour dough bread (looked great, but no taste).  Coffee was the best!  Customer Service was excellent!  Disappointed after all the hype!"}
{"text":"Limited menu selections for breakfast. I had a cheese omelette which was thin and flat; no fluffiness whatsoever. Not a fan of their style of hash browns either, and while the thick toast is good, you only get one slice cut in half and an additional slice is $2.50! The best thing was the coffee! I would have given 3 stars but the noise level is painfully loud. Metal chairs scraping across the floor make you teeth hurt! Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fast, attentive friendly service. Definitely a great breakfast hotspot just outside Phoenix. Excellent food, well put together, all was delicious and came out very quickly. Well done operation"}
{"text":"Was visiting Arizona for Spring training and was looking for a country kitchen type of breakfast and omg was this place good! We got some seasoned potatoes that were perfect in every way, my husband got a Belgium waffle that he said tasted amazing (he's a very picky eater), white toast which paired perfectly with the home made jam. The place itself is kind of small and the wait wasn't too long. Customer service was awesome..needless to say, we will be visiting again & recommend it!"}
{"text":"Totally worth the wait. Even the toast was amazing. Fresh, cracked-to-order eggs make the difference."}
{"text":"This place gets zero stars. Not sure how they stay in business. If you like getting what you pay for this is not the place for you. Where all the good reviews on yelp are coming from is a mystery to me. Coming here Was the biggest mistake we made this morning. It is not a spur of the moment joint. Plan ahead because you will have to wait 35+minutes just to be seated. Not a good place for a party greater than 4. Ladies: there no where to place your purse so you either eat with it on your lap or put on the floor, which is gross. We Waited the time,got seated & had to wait 10 min before anyone took our drink order. Thankfully we placed our food order at the same time. Waited another 8 min or so to get the drinks. Food took longer to come out. With no kids meal options we were forced to order large plates for the children. So big sad face for that. Food came out & the waffle was good, eggs over easy was fine. My daughter's scrambled eggs were fine. My omelette with cheese bacon ham looked promising & then they didn't get eaten because they were not cooked thru in sections. Figured I'd enjoy hashbrowns but they were terrible. Unseasoned crisp outside & straight baby food mush inside. Yuck. My daughter's homefries were ok except half of them had burned bottoms. I love that they use thick cut bacon but hate that they burn it black so it tastes like charcoal. All in all we spent $75 and change (tip not included) for a party of 5 & TERRIBLE food. Don't waste your hard-earned money here. Unless you like paying for bad food- go somewhere else. Not worth it. You don't get what you pay for. Plan on paying for parking because it is all metered."}
{"text":"good, but not worth the hype. Especially for the wait time."}
{"text":"I recently moved back to Tempe from the east coast, and I was excited to see Matt's had a location on Rio Salado. I used to make regular trips to Phoenix when they opened their original location, and I was always willing to endure the long wait because the food was that good.  I've now been to the Tempe location twice, but I probably won't be back anytime soon. The food is still good, but the service is terrible. The last time I went, I waited 20 minutes before a server came by to bring water. The guy working the door overheard us talk about leaving, and he promptly came to take our drink order. He was the only reason we stayed. But the service remained bad the rest of the time we were there, and the place wasn't even that busy. In fact, there were a bunch of servers just standing around talking most of the time we were there.  I've had similar service at this location twice now, so it seems like a management problem. Too bad, because I always thought the original Matt's was incredible and worth a wait. Hopefully someone can make a change to get the Tempe location better."}
{"text":"The Reuben is fairly decent for airport food. Home cut fries as well. Make sure you order an IPA to wash all that down."}
{"text":"Always consistent and quality.  The have also opened up at Sky Harbor Airport for when you are traveling."}
{"text":"Brian's Big Disappointing Breakfast   Guess my high expectations got the best of me? Been wanting to try MBB for a while now (long while since DDD!), but this first visit was sad.   Had pork chop, eggs, and hash browns. I asked them to make the hash browns crispy. They came out extra soggy. Couldn't figure out if it was grease or water, I didn't finish them.  I asked for over easy eggs, they came out over medium plus. And my sister asked for home fries, she got hash browns. The pork chop was alright.  Service was good, but if you see brown on top of the eggs, they are most likely not over-easy.   I'm sure they would have corrected everything, but it should come out right the first time, especially if there are only 3 other tables seated. I've only sent my food back twice that I can remember (once was a $50 over cooked steak).  $27.58 plus tip for two entrees and one coffee for an ok breakfast. Thumbs down. Had way better at Ronnie's Cafe for a third of the price!  My sister flew in from out of town and I wish I would have treated her to Snooze or Daily Dose or even First Watch instead. Thought this place was bomb for nom nom, but much the opposite.  The ambience and decor are fabulous.   And please tell the manager to stop saying 'you guys'.  It's unprofessional.   Glad people like it, but I won't be back.   Sincerely,  Unimpressed"}
{"text":"More like matt's small breakfast!  The big name and high prices were certainly not reflected in the portion sizes. That being said, the portions were more than enough for me and I left with a full tummy. Some of the ingredients were organic and local (yay!!), but the actual food was nothing special. In fact, the raspberry preserves were the most impressive thing I ate at matt's. I feel like I could have cooked everything there (and probably more to my liking) with the ingredients in my refrigerator and saved a chunk of change."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I have had in Phoenix. Hands down. All natural, real butter, Maple syrup!  The pancakes were soooo delicious. They come out buttered with a little jar of maple syrup to pour over them. I thought the syrup was not going to be enough to satisfy my need of having to eat pancakes smothered in syrup, but TRUST when I say these pancakes were so good that they did not need to be smothered. Also had an omelette with bacon, sausage and peppers with a side of home fries. Yes, it was as delicious as it sounds. I love food and Matt's did not disappoint. Portions were large, expect to take home leftovers unless you arrive with a hungry man appetite :) the only bad thing I can comment on is the wait. If you do not show up bright and early, expect to wait at least 30 minutes. But once you are in you will realize the food was worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"It's unbelievable slow, which can be understood, given it's an airport.  People sit down to eat either waiting on their flight to take off, or their connection flight.   The food being slow is for sure an inconvenience.  But given that these things happen, you would expect them to treat you with respect and be empathetic of travelers time.     But they have no patience with their customers.  I witnessed a waitress yell at a patron,  tell him if he had a problem, he could yelp about it.    He didn't.  But I did.     32 minutes for a grilled cheese and tomato soup.    The soup never came and I missed my connection."}
{"text":"This place is a Phoenix staple. Fast service and amazing, fresh food every time I go. I always send everyone to Matt's when they are looking for a good breakfast. Love that they added the new location on camelback!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place for.breakfast. I love waffle and they have the BEST waffle and bacon dish. I'm known for being picky with food and wow I didn't want to put my fork down. The food was delicious,the servers were amazing, the service was fast. The wait time was not too bad even with a lot of ppl waiting because the staff were quick. Definitely My go to breakfast spot whenever I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Matts is a place everyone has to go to at least once and if you don't fall in love with place idk what to tell you...   The staff is super friendly I got to have a little chat with one of the managers (I believe) he was really nice and seemed to very much love his job! Their food is super tasty and pretty affordable too. But heir strawberry jelly my gosh! DELICIOUS! Their menu is sweet and short just how I like it. Honestly I can't stand when places have an encyclopedia of a menu. I will get overwhelmed with all of the options I would probably just walk right out. The deco is really cool pretty industrial. I believe this place was on the food network so that says a lot! Also I recommend coming here early as they do get super packed. I remember trying to get a table on a weekend forget about it! It was an hour wait. I'm sorry you can be the best restaurant in the planet and I will still not wait that long.  However a definite must try!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and there is always a wait but its really worth it. The food here is everything you want out of a big breakfast lol."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff, Though I waited near 30 minutes for a two top :)  The food was good, the hasbrowns , cooked in REAL butter were nice and crispy, the griddle cakes muy deliciouso!  I don't recomend the bacon, as it was a bit undercooked, but do try the honey lemonade! WOWZA!  I am considering going back when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"Great food. The bread on the sandwiches was really fresh. The iced tea is amazing. The atmosphere is nice too. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we LOVED IT!!  We sat at the counter facing out to the street.  We ordered after 5 minutes and within 10 minutes we had our order!!  They are quick and service is GREAT!!  I had the five spot and I definitely recommend it and my husband had the hog and chick and he recommends it too  All I can say, looking forward to visiting Phoenix again so we can come back to Matt's!!!!!"}
{"text":"Overhyped? What am I missing here? I was very excited about checking out Matt's. We went on a Sunday morning, so I expected a long wait (I even brought a book). There was about an hour wait ahead of us, so I was already happy it wasn't longer than that. The exterior is cute. I was already giving the place a point on style alone and because the interior is oh-so tiny!  They had some retro looking fans going-we ended up sitting in the rear room. I had the eggs and sausage, with wheat toast. Meh. I wasn't crazy about the food. The prices were very reasonable though. My toast was way too thick, and was more a multi-grain than a wheat (hey I know the difference). I like thin, crunchy toast, not giant slabs of semi toasted bread. There is no bathroom-you have to go next door to the creepy motel to use the bathroom which is in a room .Did I mention creepy? it's super creepy. Back to the food. I didn't notice any size selections for the juices. I had an orange juice. It was freshly squeezed and very tasty, but oh so tiny. I could have finished it in a gulp. No one read us any specials, though I did hear the people next to us were read the specials (hey maybe I wanted the steak and eggs?! At least gimme the option. hmmph). The service was hurried, but not rude. Our drinks were never refreshed.. so I was licking the pulp out of my cup by my 3rd bite. My husband had the belgian waffle. Again, Meh. Nothing special. There was really nothing special here that would make me come back, the wait alone, though not as long as I expected, will keep me away."}
{"text":"Food was good, big and fairly priced.  They got our large group in quickly.  Things I would change.  Waiter was only so so.  Asked what the head of the table needed never checked with the rest of us.  Never got water the first time I asked.  Never got water the second time I asked -  gave me a second orange juice instead.  Other people who got one pancake got the same size mini container of syrup I got for 3.  When I finally stopped someone and asked for more syrup they told me I was going to have to pay $1.50 for another mini-container.  Did not make me happy.  I wasn't crazy about the pancakes anyway - they were way too thick for my taste. I would have like to have seen more creative choices on the menu."}
{"text":"I have to give it four stars because there is nothing else like it at the airport.  Very, very trendy.  Good service.  Reasonable prices.  Delish food.  I had the traditional egg, etc breakfast and the only thing traditional were the eggs.  Toast was presented in a fun way and tasted great.  Definitely high quality bacon but maybe too much pepper on the edge.  Orange juice tasted freshly squeezed.  Potatoes were yummy.  Next time I'm going to try one of the waffles.  This part might surprise you...I wasn't departing or waiting...I just landed at 9pm and saw it on the way to exiting the airport and knew that it was going to be a better meal than fast food on the way home. Go Matt."}
{"text":"Sorry, but the wait time and food don't add up. Not trying to be a hater but a friend and I ate here, wait time was close to an hour. Had a standard breakfast and to be honest, It wasn't all the hype this place receives. I would much rather go down the street for no wait and enjoy bangers and mash over at Turf. Sorry Matt, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Was waking by and had time to kill. This place was really busy and breakfast before a red eye flight sounded amazing! Say at the bar and Maria A was on point. She was one of the best servers/bartenders I've had. She was manning the bar herself and also helping some other staff. She saw your glass nearing empty before you thought about it. She also kept a smile on her face with every customer encounter. The service definitely enhanced my dining experience. All the plates coming out of the kitchen looked delicious. The Sonrisa Burrito (minus meat) was fantastic. Had great conversations at the bar. Definitely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Such fresh food and the best hash browns I've ever eaten in life!   The 30 minute wait for a table was well worth it!"}
{"text":"A small local restaurant with excellent service and food.  I was seated at a window seat immediately and was promptly served.  The hog and chick was delicious.  Worth a visit if you are staying in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Bit of a mixed bag experience here. I thought there were two separate lines for take out vs getting seated to dine in, so unfortunately we got passed up a few times before we got a table. Service was ok initially but we ended up waiting a very long time (maybe 40 minutes?) for our food. We flagged down another server once we noticed several tables who arrived after us were getting their food.  Someone came back to our table and told us our order had been lost and they had to take it again! Our original server never came back to our table once our order had to be re-taken but others came by to check on us several times.   In the end, the food was very delicious and our bill was taken care of but I probably won't be bringing my future mother in law back here ever again... I understand that mistakes happen but kinda disappointed that our original server didn't seem to notice or care how long we had to wait for our food even after we made them other servers aware of it.   I'll give this place another try with my bf instead cos the food was so good"}
{"text":"Always on Point with Quality, Product, Service.  I typically get the Five Spot Breakfast Sandwich. It comes on a soft bun/roll with 2 strips of thick cut-smoked bacon, cheese and 2 eggs cooked over medium. The price is only $5. The Taste is outstanding. Perfect combination of textures to taste. 5/5.  I also order the hash browns. Its only $2. They are freshly shredded and cooked in organic butter from a local farm. Taste is 5/5.  I save the best for last. I will eat my Five Spot and Hash Browns then I will order the 3 stack of pancakes at last. They are very quick to bring it out. It usually takes less than 3 minutes to deliver the pancakes. It comes with organic butter and real organic maple syrup. These pancakes are the best pancakes I have ever had. 5/5."}
{"text":"Tucked away in downtown Phoenix, Matt's Big Breakfast offers Big flavor (see what I did there?)  The menu, albeit small, has all the breakfast comfort food that most diners have (i.e., waffles, scrambles, pancakes, etc.) I ordered the special which was an egg scramble with jalapenos, ham and cheese. It also came with a side of potatoes, either hash browns or country style.  The best part of my scramble was the succulent ham. I never tasted breakfast ham so good. If you go to Matt's try their ham, it is no doubt, the best I've ever had.  My hashbrowns were fried to perfection: Crispy outside and soft and silky inside.   I also tried their bacon which is a thick cut peppered bacon. I don't prefer thick cut bacon, but if it's your style, you'll most likely love it.  The service was great and the food is awfully cheap. Wish they had more to choose from on their menu though!"}
{"text":"This absolutely the best and most reasonable airport food around!!  Had the omelet with mushrooms, peppers and bacon - done to perfection!!"}
{"text":"Been looking to visit Matt's Big Breakfast for a while. Today finally I had a chance to stop by. Place was busy but I was seated immediately. The food is getting all the stars, service was impersonal and never felt welcome, also they were complaining about another customer \"complicated\" order, not cool at all. The waffles were awesome and the hash browns were burned, bacon is one of the most flavored I had so far. I might try one of other locations cause this one didn't worked for me."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast, it was my last day in Phoenix and I wanted to eat at just one more place before I left. The have a daily specials menu for breakfast but you cant mix and match days. I didn't care much since they still another option i wanted. The service is a little slow but I guess that's what happens when the place is packed. The home made jelly was very good but it needed some sugar. I chose not to add any extra sugar since it would just ruin the flavor."}
{"text":"Never disappointed. Had the huevos rancheros. The honey lemonade is the bomb. No wait. Went in around 9am on a Monday. Great place for locals and visitors."}
{"text":"The Hog and Chick is excellent.  The coffee is locally roasted.  Be prepared to wait though.  I prefer the home fries over the hash browns.  The bacon is excellent."}
{"text":"Ooh--nope. No need to go here.  V OK to bad service. Don't go if you need eggs with green salsa on Tuesday. They'll tell you come back Monday. You ask for eggs and hollandaise on Monday they tell you come back Thursday. Why. My kid can't eat here."}
{"text":"While my friend Austin was here in town, he had wanted to eat at Matt's big breakfast after hearing about it on a travel channel show.  So, we wandered downtown and tried this place for breakfast.  When approaching the restaurant, we noticed that parking was limited.  Mostly sidestreet metered parking.  We found an open meter, and went inside.  The place is really cute from the outside, and crazy small on the inside.  Its more of a simple decor, with orange table tops, and white walls.  We had a small wait, and put our name on the list.  Eventually, we sat at the bar after waiting about 15 minutes in the sun. I ordered a cheese omelette, and Austin ordered a cheeseburger.  Both our food came out, and it was tasty!  Service was quick, and we were in and out of there in less then an hour.  O, and a word of advice.  The bathroom here is located in the middle of the kitchen!  I had \"to go\" while we were waiting, and I was surprised at the whole thing.  the bathroom is teeny tiny, and you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it.  Plus, its located immediately next to the grill!  If you can help it, either \"hold it\" or go before!  Fair warning for bathroom users!"}
{"text":"Arrived for the first time here at MBB!! I agree with the others that there is no sign to say be seated or seat yourself. We also stood for a bit... then I asked. Yes sit anywhere!!  We found a nice table and we were greeted by a nice man named Blake. Ordered iced tea and he told of the days special. Went to get our drinks and another friendly young lady came by for our drink order!!  Love this!! Better to have too much attention then none!!  Iced tea was amazing.  Husband ordered a cheese omelette with home fries ( caramelized onions and rosemary) and a cup of chili.  I ordered the waffle that comes with Pepper bacon. Omelette came out with hash browns.... oops.... quick fix. Boom they are back with the wonderful potato's!  Food was Amazing . Service outstanding!  Blake told us of other great things to order next time we are there!  Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best place for breakfast in town.  I've never had a bad meal and only wish they had another location further north.  Their hash browns are some of the best and I love how they use fresh ingredients.  I would try a week day for your first experience so you don't have to wait as long for seating."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast ! Best hash browns I've ever had. The strawberry spread is to die for ! I think it's just strawberries lemon and honey - so delicious. The owner was sweet and kind and checked on every table / I'm very impressed - now let's get Matt's Big Breakfast to Florida"}
{"text":"MATT'S! I don't even need to write this review. Everyone already knows how awesome Matt's is. AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW: RUN THERE.  Whenever we have to drive up to or through PHX from Tucson, we stop here. We go without eating breakfast, drive the 2 hours, wait in line and eat here. It's just that good.   This place is simple. The frills* are few but they make a hard impact. The thick-cut sourdough toast with super excellent fresh homemade jam (*frill). The rosemary (*frill) on the home fries. SIMPLY delicious.  My go to is the 5 Spot (breakfast sandwich with egg, melty cheese, GRILLED ONIONS (*frill), and thick-cut bacon, and one pancake on the side (real butter, real syrup *frills).   For the two of us to eat here: full breakfasts with coffee, it's under $30. The wait on the weekends for two is usually 30 minutes, so not bad for regular breakfasters like us.   Seriously, the food is so fresh and that's just what makes it so good. The staff is so efficient and extra friendly. We always have so much fun and such a good meal here. This is a place where we will always visit as much as we can."}
{"text":"The overall environment is modern.   We had to wait 30 mins to be seated but we dint mind.   The food's comes from a simple menu is basically breakfast & then lunch after 11, and the portion sizes are decent, but yet the food did not full me. Service was prompt and courteous. The 4 stars just stems from the fact that the food didn't fill me, and they ice the water to death (Don't mind me. I hate ice in my water.)"}
{"text":"I have been here several times however today was different. I found the food to be so-so. Everything was over cooked, not 1 person asked if was wanted anything else or how was our meal. The service was horrible. I won't be back nor will I recommend it anymore"}
{"text":"I love this place!  its so small but so cute at the same time. I think nearly everything is homemade which is great! their homemade strawberry jam is delicious!! They have the best pancakes! No syrup needed!  You MUSt get the hashbrowns!! everything tastes so fresh and flavorful. Its one of my favorite breakfast joints. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars from me is because the staff is kind of ALL OVER THE PLACE which tends to get a little annoying. Other than that, no complaints! Go here and BON APETITE!"}
{"text":"Checked out the new location which is much nicer and roomier than the old one. I loved everything again and their homemade jams from scratch is the most amazing thing ever!   Initially I gave them 5 stars but I decided on 4 this time because almost their entire menu has nothing but pork! Come on, not everyone eats pork! :("}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great service. Love the homemade fruit compote they serve with the toast alongside the meals and the fresh lemonades they offer. I always get something different when I go typically the special of the day. One of my favorite breakfast spots."}
{"text":"Despite the rave from yelp reviews, I thought this place was just OK - nothing special if you ask me. Nothing wow'ed me. I came in around 6:30am so beat the crowd which started pouring in an hour later.  The food portions are generous.  Pulpy orange juice - YUM  Hash brown was bland on its own (ate my friend's hash brown), not as flavorful as I would've hoped. I still ate the whole thing with ketchup and pepper.   I ordered The Hog and Chick with eggs over medium, thick bacon and wheat toast. The home fries were too hard for my taste, wanted them to be more on the softer side with crispy edges but it looked and tasted overcooked. The bacon was thick but it also tasted overcooked. Again, I still ate everything so still good.  Service was great - they came around a few times offering coffee and water refills, asked how we were doing.   I'd still recommend a trip here but go in with low expectations. It might have been all the hype about the placed that I heard (it was featured in Triple D) so I came in thinking this was going to be a diner with something unique to offer..."}
{"text":"This place was Amazing. A little busy but really great food and perfect portions. The only complaint I would have is it was a little cramped but again they were pretty busy"}
{"text":"Came in for some brain food right before a final. We specifically asked our waiter if the turn around time was quick since I had class in an hour. I think mentioning our hurry made him pay less attention to detail. We ordered a plate that came with bacon and we stated we were vegetarians and that we wanted to sub that out for hash browns. When we got the food, there was bacon right across the entire plate. He didn't even notice until the second time he came around and said \"aw they gave you bacon?\" And proceeded to charge us for both bacon and hash browns. We didn't have the time to even point out the mistake. Honestly this was the worst customer service and worst breakfast I've had. Far from brain food. Was late to my final. Oh and they \"don't do creamer\" for your coffee."}
{"text":"Great food awesome atmosphere fast service about a 30minute wait on a sunday morning.  loved the breakfast sandwhich"}
{"text":"Was in town early March and looking for something to do for breakfast.  Matt's did not disappoint.  It was a Saturday morning and we managed to get in before the crowd but by the time we left it was packed.  Portions were perfect and the service was outstanding.    There was a good selection of breakfast choices and the lady beside us even asked about a BLT lunch sandwich and they said they could do it!  Our food came out in good time and was fresh and very well seasoned.  The breakfast special was incredible and the potatoes were perfect!    Will definitely be back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I guess they just opened a location here at Sky Harbor. I had never been to the original location, so I guess this is a truly objective review.   I'm not from Phoenix; just here for work and decided to have lunch here before my flight back home. But I wasn't that satisfied.   First impressions: great looking menu. I love american breakfast so I was very excited to try it out. I remember seeing the original location on an episode of Triple D as well. Apparently there's always a huge wait at the original location; definitely not the case here. I was seated in 10 seconds. Few reasons include the new location, noobie visitors who have never heard of it, and just the location in general. It's airport food, so you're only going to eat it because it's convenient. I wonder if anyone's ever booked a flight for another airline just because they know MBB is at Terminal 4! Furthermore, there's also a take-out section of the entrance that was completely empty as well.   The service was lacking. Don't get me wrong, the waitresses were very friendly, but they're definitely not on their game. First of all, I was seated at a long counter area that had customers on both sides -- not a problem. Probably could have sat 15 people staggered. Most people are dining alone anyways so no complaints on my end. What made me a little fed up was they seated another man RIGHT in front of me. Mind you, they were NOT busy and the counter is hardly 2 ft wide, so this man was pretty much breathing on my food. If I had leaned in another foot, I could have kissed the guy. I'm sure he wasn't happy either. Dude, stagger your customers if they're dining alone. If all other seats are taken, ask for the permission of both parties. The rest of the counter is empty. Even the guys next to me at their booth were like wtf. C'mon.   Every single person around me was missing something before they even got their food. I didn't receive a straw. My new involuntary best friend in front of me didn't get a napkin or utensils. And the other tables around me didn't get utensils or condiments. Get it together MBB!  Now onto the food. I ordered the Chop & Chick and asked for a waffle instead of toast; didn't mind paying extra. Waffle wasn't bad; tastes like a pretty good waffle I could have made at home. The pork chop and home fries had way too much rosemary. Also, the home fries weren't fries at all, they were just stir fried potatoes, but apparently most people are aware of this so that's my problem. The pork chop was good, a tad but overcooked but the flavor was good. Nothing I'd go out of the way for. and not that juicy either.   When I received my check, I noticed that I was charged for 2 full meals when I simply asked for one replacement item on my meal. They had charged me for a full waffle plate as well as the full chop & chick. The waffle plate comes with bacon ( I didn't receive bacon) and they didn't subtract the toast from my order. The toast wasn't a big deal at all, but the waitress could have told me that they don't have waffles a la carte instead of making me pay for 2 whole meals. This is NOT acceptable.   I was running late for my flight, so I didn't have the time to waive down the waitress. I just paid for the bill and left pretty irked. My meals are covered by the company, so whatever.   Won't be coming back here again. 2 stars."}
{"text":"Really good place for breakfast. Fun environment and the food was delicious. Parking is paid only and there was about a 20 minute wait on a Friday. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome service & Food!!! Having wonderful service and then awesome food just makes this place ROCK!!! First time here and it was Great!!"}
{"text":"Yes, the food is fresh and tasty and fairly priced and locally owned, woo hoo!  But is it worth two hours on a Monday morning to get a place for 3 people to sit? No. Not ever.  So even though I won't fight to get a table there again, I can say that my omelette was hot and tasty, the rosemary potatoes savory and filling, and the toast thick and...toasty. I like my coffee a little stronger, but hey, I recognise that many people don't, so no points lost there.  Because even though they have real butter and syrup, the whole reason I go out to breakfast because I want the time-saving convenience of having someone do everything for me. In that amount of time, I could have done the shopping, made the food, and cleaned it up, and I would have used real butter, too!"}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. Bacon was superb. Even the oatmeal was tastier than usual. Fast service was a huge plus too."}
{"text":"I have been told about Matt's countless times and always heard about what a tiny place it was, but until I actually went for the first time, I never got the irony in the name \"Matt's Big Breakfast.\"   I was doped up on anesthesia, so I really enjoyed sitting at the window bar so I could people watch, and so that the other patrons could not watch my weird facial expressions.   For a vegetarian, the menu did not have a huge offering, but it was a clear choice for me: egg and cheese omelet with cheddar and provolone, hash-browns, sourdough toast and coffee.   Ummm... DELICIOUS!!!! Seriously, this breakfast was really awesome. I might have gained five pounds from the butter it was all cooked in, but really, who cares.   The blackberry jam they happened to be serving that day was absolutely phenomenal, and I hate jam, so you know it must have been good.   I don't know if they have a bathroom but it did not appear so. As previously mentioned in probably every review and earlier in my review, this place is reallllly small.   The service was great. They served our drinks, took our order and served our food quicker than I expected, especially since the place was packed the entire time.   The only thing that kept this place from being 5 stars was the coffee. It just wasn't good. Call me a coffee snob if you must."}
{"text":"Thank goodness I finally made it. Went on a Sunday morning around 10am expecting a wait and didn't wait longer than 5 minutes, I think the horrendous construction might be keeping people away.   The flavors in my Saturday Special three egg scramble with Cabot cheddar, sautéed jalapenos, and Shreiner's chicken enchilada sausage were bursting. The jalapenos had great heat. The hash browns come in a slab with the perfect ratio of crispy top and bottom to a soft, almost creamy center. Then, as if you needed some more carbs, they throw a large tortilla on top of it all. My scramble plate and his waffle were easily shared with two of us- we both left stuffed. $27 including coffee.   Coffee- great! Waffles- light, fluffy, savory, and slightly sweet, served with real maple syrup.  The incredible bacon like they serve you reminds you not all bacon is created equal. Service- fast and friendly.   We have so much more to explore on the menu. Can't get back soon enough."}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious!!! Service was excellent too. Breakfast for 2 was $28!! Not bad. Always wanted to try this place as it was on Diners Drive in and dives! I would definitely come back. We came at a good time as there was no line to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"went back for a second time and got the waffle, oats, and eggs Benedict. I really wanted the french toast, but it's only served on Wednesday. The waffle had a really good flavor. Similar flavor to the pancake. I would suggest the waffle or pancake at this place."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast!  Big Servings!  Good price!  The Bloody Mary is a meal in its self!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said...  Should you go: yes Does is live up to the hype: yes Is it worth the wait:yes  K, got that out the way. I'm always a bacon, eggs (over easy), potatoes and toast for breakfast guy-its exactly what I need and always perfect here. My wife goes with the pork chop breakfast and loves it.   Food is hot and fresh as can be. I haven't been disappointed yer. If your a \"breakfast person\" this place is for you"}
{"text":"Good thing we had a long layover..... Potatoes only tasted like rosemary. Bacon wasn't salty but thick. Bread was great. Over easy eggs were dry.   Seating for 2 are so close to your neighbors that I saw a heavy set guy walk away from the place.   Even regular sized customers were way too close together. A shot of Baileys for your coffee was $12.00 and they had no idea what a side of red was..... I don't frequent Phoenix but if I did, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Based on service, cuisine and originality alone I would back Matt up in a knife fight any day."}
{"text":"Yum! Very much enjoyed my breakfast!  The family and I stopped in before an appointment down town during the week, perfect time because there wasn't a wait at all, even for 6 of us. We got to sit at the cute table in what looked like their front area that doubles as a prep kitchen.   We did have to wait a few minutes to get drinks, seemed to be last on the waitresses priority list. Over all service wasn't stellar, but the food was great so I didn't mind much. My brother did enjoy his strawberry lemonade tremendously, if I am correct it is house made lemonade and homemade strawberry preserves added. Looked yummy!  I got a traditional 2 eggs over medium (made perfectly! just runny enough with no snot on the whites), hash-browns and bacon. The bacon is awesome! thick cut and peppery!  A few others got their special that day, eggs and churrizo and a tortilla, wow so good! Not too spicy and tons of flavor!  Matt's is pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"WOW!  We haven't been to Matt's Big Breakfast in ages... and that was in downtown Phoenix.  Since they have more recently set up a place close to our home, we made it today!   The location is part of the Rio Salado complex on Tempe Town Lake.  Very beautiful day and location.  Parking was interesting, only because 2 out of the 3 of us are gimpy.  So while there, I asked how to park closer and that was very helpful.      Our server was Daniel.  If I could hire someone, it would be Daniel in a heartbeat!  He was kind, thoughtful, friendly and there for everything we needed.  The coffee...  well, I loved it!  It is hearty and isn't the watered-down version of coffee that most places serve.  (\"Roastery of Cave Creek. Ground daily.\")       Two of us had \"The Hog & Chick\" with 2 eggs, toast, hash browns or homefries, and meat.  I had it scrambled, white toast, sausage patties and hash browns.  It was perfection plus strawberry preserves!  Everyone ate everything!  Our friend had the waffle and bacon... the first words out of her mouth were \"OH MY GOD!\" after her bite of bacon.  She kept looking at it and chewing and she could not believe it was that good.  All of us loved loved loved the meal and the attentiveness of Daniel.       I must also mention the person that cooked our great breakfast, Forest!  I met him at the counter and I must give hats off to the person who hired these guys!  Forest did a great job, because each of us wanted to lick our plates.      We will be back."}
{"text":"So I'll probably get some hate, but whatever.   It's good, but not top ten best breakfast places in the valley. I enjoyed it and the service was solid but I wasn't wow'd. Have it a few tries and never had anything I couldn't reproduce at home with some effort.   Like I said the food is good and the service is solid. Especially for the price, but come on! Lol  I'm shocked at the amount of 5 Stars this place has... either people just blindly love all things DDD or they need higher breakfast standards."}
{"text":"Good, fast service, large portions and tasty food. It's nothing fancy, but they have perfected what they have! Love it!"}
{"text":"We stopped here in Arizona for an airport layover and we had around 1 hour to spare.  We were in and out in 30 minutes.  Depending on whom you get you can order lunch and dinner.  If you get the muscular bald headed guy with lots of energy he will make it happen.  I ordered the pork and eggs and made a sandwich out of it.  The blt is goof as they use the fat bacon."}
{"text":"Yes, I was there.  I had breakfast too.  So did my wife.  I had a cheese omelette with a side of bacon.  What I got was a cheese and bacon omelette.  But it was good.  A bit dry, but good.  The hash-browns were really good too.  The iced tea was fresh.  My wife liked whatever she got too.  The place is small, crowded and noisy, but to be fair, there was a large party of large and noisy people seated next to us.  Our server was sweet.  We knew her from another local dining spot, so we chatted a bit.  She was a big fan of Fox restaurants.  So are we.  But this was Matt's, not that other place.    Service was excellent, food was pretty good, ambiance just so-so.  I really don't get places that think the Industrial look with zero sound insulation is a good idea.  Nobody can hear their table mates talking, so they just talk louder.  For someone like me (hearing impaired), it makes it really difficult to have any conversation whatsoever.  I usually just take my hearing aids out and wink and blow kisses at my wife now and then.  Once I missed and I got a really weird look from the hotty soccer mom that was staring at me from the other booth.  I didn't tell my wife."}
{"text":"Consistently the best breakfast joint in Phoenix. This place blows the competition out of the water without any pretension. The line is long but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Very good filling breakfast with great service and a fair price. I was in town on business and I like to look for a local place for breakfast rather than the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised. No complaints. I would go back if I'm in town again. Thanks for the great breakfast."}
{"text":"This is strictly because - why on earth would a place as popular as this one not have text when your name is called available...or shaded/covered seating while you wait? In ARIZONA???"}
{"text":"This is a fun spot in downtown Phoenix.  I had the salami scramble and it was amazing.  The menu is kind of small, but the food is good.  It's a small restaurant, and I don't think they have a parking lot.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Matt's at Terminal 4 in Sky Harbor.  What a great concept (adding a full bar).  The restaurant and bar, counters and tables are just beautiful.  Nice decor that reminds you of Matt's downtown.  However, the food here is just not the same.  Scrambled eggs were dry and seemed like they had been cooked for a buffet.  Potatoes not as good as the original.  Toast was superior (they must have stayed with the same baker).  I saw so much food being thrown away (folks just weren't enjoying their breakfast).  Overall, I was disappointed.  I'll give Matt's another try next time I travel and hope the quality returns.  Come on Matt, get it together and serve quality breakfasts like you are known for."}
{"text":"I ordered the cheese omelette with provolone, added mushrooms, roasted peppers, and sautéed onions, and a freshly squeezed orange juice. The omelette came with hash browns and sourdough toast with house-made strawberry preserve. The omelette didn't have much flavor, and the insides were a bit watery. The hash browns were too oily and didn't have much flavor. The best part of the breakfast was probably the strawberry preserve, which, well, wasn't supposed to be the star of the breakfast. The freshly squeezed orange juice was fine too. The service was pretty good, but the food just wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and each time is amazing. First time I had visited with some coworkers. The food is awesome and the service is so kind!   This place is so busy! If you're looking for a quiet place for food and conversation, this isn't it. I don't care, because it can tell everyone and everything is upbeat.   I recommend going on Sunday for their steak and eggs, the hash browns are amazing, and the steak is a much better quality than I thought we'd get.   Only downside is that they don't split checks, I totally get it, but when you visit their Tempe location, it doesn't make sense to not split checks since they are in a work campus for Statefarm."}
{"text":"If you are craving basic nothing special breakfast food save yourself the hour long wait outside in the 100 degree heat and go eat at Denny's or IHOP.  Trust me you'll pay half as much and leave feeling less icky.  I seriously don't understand the draw of this place.  The whole restaurant seats maybe 20-30 people, so we ended up sitting outside in the heat for over an hour waiting for a table.  Other reviews claim much longer wait times.  When we finally got a table our waitress was friendly enough and got our drink orders pretty promptly.  When they brought us our food  was nothing special just eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns.  The quality was no better than what you might get at any typical breakfast joint.  Seriously Food Network I don't understand what all the fuss is about.  The waitress forgot to bring us our bread.  After two requests and our meal just about finished our bread was finally delivered to the table.  Unfortunately, my boyfriend's bread had a little something extra...a nice long hair.  Disgusting!!    Never again."}
{"text":"I just went to Phoenix for the first time this past week, and one of the must stop places on my list was this restaurant: Matt's Big Breakfast. This place has been featured on Dinners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network. On the third day of our trip, my husband and I went here, despite warnings from my cousin that the wait could take hours. Fortunately for us, we only waited twenty minutes. Upon entering this tiny retro diner, I ordered the special, an egg scramble with thick bacon, fontina cheese, and baby spinach in it. This was accompanied by hash browns, homemade bread and homemade jam. I was very pleased with my choice of meals, it was awesome!! My husband ordered the Hog and Chick. This is a meal that comes with two eggs any style, ham, fresh bread and jam, as well as a choice of hash browns or potatoes. My husband said the ham was incredibly delicious. I tried the potatoes with fresh rosemary and liked those even more than my hash browns. Both of our meals were around $8.00 each. There were not too expensive and they kept us full all day. Despite working in tight quarters, the waiters and waitresses were friendly and helpful. Because our overall experience was so good, my husband and I returned here the morning we left for the airport. This time we both had the hog and chick. It was just as good as what I ordered previously. I highly recommend this sweet little joint in the heart of the southwest!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! This place is what breakfast is all about! Everything was amazing. Me and my sister both had the pork chops! Pork chops for breakfast!!!!! There was nothin left when we were done! The food came out quick the wait was short! Next time I'm in town I will definitely be stopping here."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here. Unfortunately, it turned out not be as good as I expected. I was in town and staying near the airport with some extra morning time and decided to take the light rail system to downtown and walk to Matt's. First, it's in a great area of Phoenix, near the downtown ASU campus. It's a little bit of a hike from the train line to Matt's but the walk was great. I sat at the counter and was greeted very warmly, with was the best part of the visit.  All of the waitresses were great. I went with a simple breakfast, eggs in a sandwich with bacon, which was pretty good.  I also ordered the homefries, as opposed to the hash browns. Can get hash browns anywhere and wanted to try their personal touch on fries.  Absolutely plain and lacked much flavor. Too chewy and rubbery.  At that moment I wish I had ordered the hash browns.  It's a cute place, service was great and everyone was very friendly.  But in this particular case, I was disappointed in the food. I'm not a big meat eater and that is probably what sells best here.  Maybe next time it will be better."}
{"text":"I landed at the Phoenix airport and wanted a quick sandwich before my next flight. This isn't the place. The service is slow and the staff is inattentive. Had the waitstaff been working and not not talking or standing around, the service could be better. Hopefully their chicken sandwich will be worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, although watch what you order \"à la carte\". It will add up FAST!"}
{"text":"Greasy spoon with quality ingredients cooked to harden arteries. The service was less than stellar, but the atmosphere was cozy (read: tight) and not terribly unpleasant. The food was standard tasting - this place could do with a regular deep cleaning and perhaps some attempt to de-grease the food prep. The service could also use a bit of a boost... perhaps they should partake of their own coffee - the caffeine could help wake them up a bit.  There are some great little places like this dispersed around central Phoenix that give the downtown area some great character. This one is on the low end of the group. A few small changes and this place could easily improve to a 5 star  - but since it's so popular, there's hardly a reason to change anything I suppose.   I'm thankful that I live near downtown Scottsdale where awesome breakfast choices are bountiful. Matt's is worth a visit, but only just."}
{"text":"Yes, you have to wait a long time to eat here... I came to Matt's on a Saturday with a friend and we waitedddddddd, but boy was it worth it. It could just be that I was just THAT hungry and anything I ate at that point was going to be amazing, but I'd like to think it was because the food wasn't some greasy no flavor mess you get at iHOP or god forbid...Denny's. They use fresh ingredients and they have REAL butter on their pancakes and waffles!!!! btw...the waffles are like....how do I put this?.... Waffle heaven! When they offer you the home fries or the hash browns, say home fries! and I only say that because I have not tasted the hash browns and I think the home fries are amazing! The home fries are potatoes made in buttery goodness, rosemary, and onions (not over-onion-baring at all). The freshly squeezed orange juice is tiny but it is sooo worth the $2.50 for those exquisite 6 sips! Staff was very attentive and friendly, the hostess was apologizing to everyone for the wait... and I think she really meant it :)"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and both times were great!  The food is fresh and tastes wonderful.    Pros: +excellent tasting food +excellent customer service +locally brewed coffee (from Cave Creek) +thick slices of bacon +fresh squeezed orange juice +real maple syrup +you do NOT feel terrible after eating here, like some places!  I felt energized and ready to take on the day  Cons: -may have to wait for a table, but worth it -no biscuits or biscuits & gravy on the menu -would like to see an all-natural sweetener such as Stevia available -would like to see organic ketchup available as a condiment  Those cons are very minor and aren't even a big deal.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"First the good, then the bad. I arrived at 1:45 PM and was seated / waited on in a very timely manner. Service was good and the food came out quickly ...... too quickly as you will read in the bad. The potatoes were hot and well seasoned, the eggs were as ordered (over easy). The toast was very good, but only one piece (thick toast).  Now for the bad. The bacon was not even close to being cooked (half raw) and I sent it back. By the time the bacon came back I was basically done with the other food. The worst part was the amount of oil in my plate. It had to be almost an 1/8 of a cup of oil.  I am not a health nut I have eaten at plenty of greasy spoon restaurants and would gladly go back to a few....... but this was ridiculous.  I mentioned this was my first visit when I ordered and as I was paying the waitress asked how my breakfast was. I told her \"I have never seen that much oil on a plate and as you know they bacon was almost raw\" .......  her reply was at least it is olive oil."}
{"text":"For two and a half years I have been anxiously waiting to try this place.... I saw it on diners drive in and dives before I moved to Phoenix and couldn't wait. Things kept getting in the way but today was the big day! After waiting HOURS in the social security office close by, I became starved. I drove on over and had to find parking behind it in the TINY parking spaces, typical of downtown. I was greeted instantly by a waiter and he gave me plenty of options. I sat at the bar and was greeted by a friendly waitress. I opted for the special and a side pancake. The coffee, was awful. They did not also have cream and only offered milk. I was really disappointed as I like a very simple coffee. My pancake was delicious but the rest was subpar. They only offer one hot sauce and my hash browns were mushy. It was a downtime but the waitresses were all talking amongst themselves eating and the chef staff was in the kitchen being ridiculously loud and goofing off the entire hour I was there. I am really disappointed with my visit and will be sticking to my usual US EGG, breakfast joint. If you're in the mood for pancakes and you are downtown I do recommend this place, other than that... try somewhere else!"}
{"text":"The name makes my mouth water.  Matts Big Breakfast.   Quality food, this location will make you proud of what downtown phoenix has to offer and what is to Come.  From the vegetables to the meat selection hand picked food creates quality dishes.     This location serves a  big breakfast in a small place. I look forward to seeing this place grow, do i hear patio?"}
{"text":"I never do one star reviews, I leave that to other  folks however I have to keep it on the realz. Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced not once but twice.  Had to drop my kiddo off at the airport super duper early today. I always wait at the gate with her. I grabbed my usual coffee from the Refuge and they are always awesome! Decided to grab a sandwich to go from this place and walked up to the \"to go\" counter and the waitress who was prepping said and I quote \"I have to check to see if we are open\" and walked away. The gentlemen who was in line with me said they open @ 5:30 (it was 5:30) so they are open. There were 6 people working, bartender, host, cook, mgr and a couple other people. Why comeeeee the waitress never came back, no one acknowledged the growing line of folks waiting to order. I walked over to the bartender who was actually taking food orders for the folks who sat at the bar and politely asked if someone was going to take our orders and she said without one glance that the waitress will be over in a min. Mind you we had been standing there for 7 mins, every single person that worked there looked over at the ever growing to go line. I/we watched the waitress go get water for a table, coffee then slowly walk to get a coke! Reallyyyy folks... really! After almost 10 mins I was like let's bounce. As I walked by the waitress was taking the food order of the one table she had. Everyone else was sitting at the bar! Still not one person working there went over to the \"to go\" line.   How very very rude. This  place needs to get it the heck together and revisit their customer service etiquette. The shift manager was there too! Wow just wow.    Done and done....never again!"}
{"text":"The food here was AMAZING! I felt like there was not a huge amount of variety in the menu, but what Matt's does, they do very well! The bacon, in particular, is thick-cut and delicious. It took us about twenty minutes to get a table, but it was worth it for sure!"}
{"text":"The waitress' chests were the BIG in Matt's Big Breakfast...  When we travel, our days revolve around our food...always trying to find that town's \"wow\" restaurant. While Matt's Big Breakfast was super super friendly and quite quick at seating us and serving our food....the meals were just okay...nothing really special. I ordered their daily special which was a scramble with spinach, cheese and sausage. The portion was perfect...not too much, not too little....definitely not BIG. My error was ordering something I can get at any breakfast diner I guess. BUT it was healthy, that's a plus! My husband ordered the pork chop...again, it was good. Nothing \"wow'd\" us as we had hoped....well maybe we were wow'd when the waitress would lean over and refill our coffee cups. Again, we found Matt's BIG in the low-cut tight dresses of the waitresses, no complaints there though."}
{"text":"First review ever about an airport restaurant as they are usually mediocre at best.  But just had best airport breakfast ever with perfectly cooked over easy eggs, thick cut bacon, home fries cooked with onion and rosemary, and a nutty home grain toast with fresh raspberry jam, and locally roasted coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice.  The service was quick and the waiter was friendly and unhurried; he even brought me a large go cup of coffee gratis.  The restaurant was like an oasis in the desert after suffering all the indignities of PHX TSA. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I drove past this restaurant and saw people outside waiting. I immediately yelped and found it. The reviews are right on the money. Yes there will be a wait, yes it will be crowded, yes it will be loud and yes the food is amazing and worth all of it. Came here for breakfast on Saturday got in line around 11am got seated right before 12pm. So we ended up have one breakfast dish The Waffle with Bacon and a lunch dish the Butter Burger. There were both delicious. The Waffle is fluffy buttery and fresh the crispy thick cut bacon is salty and balances out the sweetness of the real maple syrup. The butter burger is on point the meat is fresh and cooked to your liking the bun is the icing on the cake it's sweet and tasty. We also had orange juice and when I say orange juice I mean fresh squeezed right into the glass.  It tasted like I had an orange with a straw. The strawberry lemonade was sweet and tangy. The staff was friendly and helpful they took very good care of us. We will definitely be back I hope your enjoy your experience here as much as we did. Thanks for reading. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Really people? You all think this place is good? Actually I apologize, their bacon is incredible, if you want a great experience from here order 5 pounds of their bacon to go and never look back.   My fiancé and I drove from Las Vegas and got to Matt's BB right in time for it to open so there was hardly any line for us which was good because I'd have felt like a real sucker if I had waited long. We walked in and the floor had gum all over it..yum? And also a smelly dishrag smell going on, I'm not going to lie the place looked a little iffy when it came to cleanliness but maybe I'm just particular about that kind of thing. Any way we sat ourselves at a tiny table and opened our tiny menu, there wasn't much on the menu and the stuff that was on it was kinda boring. All the waitresses are wearing whatever they rolled out of bed in i.e. tennis shorts that just covered their butt, and cut off jean shorts with strings and pockets hanging off them, my fiancé made a comment about Hooters which was appropriate for what most of them were wearing. I ordered the Five Spot which was reminiscent of a breakfast jack from Jack in the Box. My fiancé ordered the waffle which he said was good but left him hungry.   Later on we drove past and saw a huge group of people waiting outside I felt like warning them. Any way we came here because of Diners Drive-ins and Dives and this place was definitely a dive, it was our first triple d experience and we felt cheated by Guy, and really thought of not going anywhere he recommended again, I'm glad we did though because for dinner we went somewhere awesome, I'll review that place little later!"}
{"text":"Food was good, phenomenal if you consider the fact it's airport food, and the service was quick, I had mine 10 minutes after I sat down. Toni was very attentive and made sure I had everything I needed when I wanted it. The quality is not quite on par with the downtown location, but it is defiantly above the rest for PHX."}
{"text":"Got the 5 spot and special scramble with schreiners sausage.  Always a favorite breakfast spot of ours"}
{"text":"Drove out of our way to try and we were not disappointed! Fast Great food in a funky close atmosphere, and amazing food !"}
{"text":"I get paying what the market will bear, the basic economic principal of guns and butter.  But I'm still aggravated when I pay exorbitant prices at the airport and feel slighted, which is all too common.    Not in this case, Matt's Big Breakfast at the cost of $10.83 (pre tip) delivered a quality meal, good service, and a fair price.  I had the Sonrisa Burrito which satisfied my hunger, and was top shelf quality.  It had plenty of scrumptious bacon, jalapenos, potatoes, and perfectly cooked eggs.  The highlight was the swine, they make mean bacon strips!  Another plus was the side salsa they provided, much better than anything that comes out of a bottle.  I washed my burrito down with a cup of coffee.   The physical location is open air, bright and friendly.  They also have a big square bar which can seat around 20 people.  I found my way to the sit down counter, where my server was Kristie, she was friendly, but obviously busy.  I never say this, but I was completely satisfied with my bang for the buck!"}
{"text":"The breakfast and coffee were absolutely amazing. Small venue which allows to hear the conversation of your party. The service is excellent. Not a long wait time to be seated. Will return again."}
{"text":"The bacon..... OMG. that is all. If you come here, please please buy the bacon. the waffles are fluffy and yummy as well. The only downside to this place is there is always a wait :/ But once the food comes out thats all that matters to me and my hubby. Overall, staff is friendly and service is quick and to the point but the food trumps it all."}
{"text":"We went on a weekday, which probably helped minimize the notorious wait time.  We were seated at a high table, in the front/private dining room, which also serves as a storage location. There was a lot of traffic in and out, but not to the point of being bothersome, and the view out the front window made it well worth it.  I ordered the special, a Denver scramble, and had cinnamon raisin toast, with homemade strawberry jam.  The scramble was delicious, but the jam was amazing!  I enjoyed my meal, and my experience, and will likely return."}
{"text":"Totally worth the wait! First time in Phoenjx and I'm glad this was my first dining experience.  I loved how the staff worked so efficiently together and there is always somebody waiting to help you with refills and anything you need.  It was definitely a show of good leadership with the owner walking around to help. I would definitely plan to eat here many times over if I'm back in Phoenix.  I had the cheese omelet, side of bacon, hash browns and sourdough toast.  Everything was beyond delicious and I would highly recommend the hash browns - crunchy on the outside and so creamy inside.  Killing it Matt's Big Breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"WOW! I WASN'T Expecting my flight to leave so soon! I had already ordered my food and they had served my friend and I a cup of soda . I got curious and checked the time we were suppose to go on the plain. We had 8 minutes to board! The employees understood out situation and didn't give us a hard time! Next time I'm here I will thank them personally! Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"After finally going I definitely believe all the hype. Everything I got was delicious; the pancakes, waffle, eggs, bacon, hash browns and even fresh squeezed orange juice. I got there at 9:20 on a Sunday and there was about an hour wait, but it was well worth it.   It is a very small restaurant, but that obviously does not stop the people from enjoying their great food. The service was on point, our food came out right away and when I ordered some extra things, that came out right away too. I would definitely like to try their lunch menu as well."}
{"text":"My dad and I stopped in here a couple weeks again to get a quick bite to eat. This place has become one of the most popular and talked about breakfast spots in Phoenix. Now that I finally got to try it I can taste why it had so much hype. From the customer service to the food and the decor everything was great. I can't wait to go back and try a different dish."}
{"text":"Don't think it lives up to hype. I only come here when my friends want to come but I think there's way better food and overall friendlier service elsewhere. If you're in the area I recommend First Watch across the street."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of matts. Have been for 2 years now. Their service is great, but more importantly their food is amazing. Always order teh home fries. My favorites are the hog and chick and the big butter burger. The only slight downfall is the wait, if it looks like there are 25 people in front of you on the list, it might be best to just go another time.  Unless you're willing to wait more than two hours."}
{"text":"I have to say that for breakfast or brunch this is the spot to go. I haven't been here in awhile but like always they never disappoint."}
{"text":"I am another who does not understand the hype about this diner. I have been there twice.  I have had the waffles and hash browns.   The waffles were soggy and the hash browns were very greasy (both times).  I could have done that at home without the 45 minute wait.  Plus, the coffee is putrid."}
{"text":"I went to Matt's the other morning for a solo breakfast before work. I was treating myself because I'd been on a gluten-free diet for over a month and that was the day I was reintroducing wheat after getting some blood drawn, and I'd been literally dreaming about waffles for weeks.   Diet aside, it was such a nice, cheerful way to start my day. I'd been to Matt's before for a Sunday brunch, and we waited forever outside in the heat. This was totally different: I walked in and sat down at the counter, no wait at all, and the waitstaff is very attentive and quick. I found myself smiling out at downtown Phoenix through that big picture window before my beloved waffles had even graced my place setting.   Waffles: solid. Belgian. Bacon: thick-cut and peppered. I could have eaten 5 more slices. Homefries: this is what I remember as being so stand-out from my first visit, and they did not disappoint the second time. Crispy, tasty potato chunks with caramelized onions and sauteed bits of rosemary...oh yum. And they're not even made of wheat.  Thanks, Matt, for giving me a lovely mid-week breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Breakfast in downtown .... the line and wait is worth it.  Wish they had a bigger place !"}
{"text":"I normally LOVE this place because any other time, I would've given a five star rating. Today, I went for the first time in a couple months. Normally, to keep my toddler distracted I give him gold fish or some kind of snack from home. I know that's he's hungry and toddlers don't understand the idea of waiting. I was feeding him gold fish when a waitress came up to me to inform me that I can't bring outside food in. His sippy cup was allowed but that's it. Are you serious? I didn't bring Taco Bell in. I brought in gold fish for my toddler who would, if I let him, cause mass destruction just by running around. It was ridiculous.   The food was good but to be informed I can't give my toddler snacks from home inside, it gives me a reason not to come back. I know, I know most people wouldn't see this as a problem but if you can't accommodate my child, no reason to come back."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Matt's for a few years but today's experience has soured to a point that I doubt return is likely.  Historically, Matt's pancakes have been the tastiest and fluffiest pancakes so much that when the craving strikes, no other pancake will do.  Ordered the pancakes this morning expecting the same fully goodness and was unpleasantly surprised with a gummy, chewy and dense-with-a-hint-of-stale stack of nastiness.  Think pre-teen hockey puck.  Couldn't even choke half of one pancake down.  Between the declining quality of their food and the obnoxiously loud dining room, you'd be better off skipping MBB."}
{"text":"honestly, its all about that toast and homemade jam! place is crazy busy during peak hours."}
{"text":"Probably give the food about 2.5 stars and the service about a 1.. we came about 20 minutes or so after they opened so they weren't super busy yet.. the waitress came and took our order and got our drinks but that's about the only time we had anyone take care of us.. they dropped off our food and just left... there were no \"do you guys need anything else?\" Etc etc.. the waitresses kept refilling everyone else around us but for some reason they just skipped our table every time... the food was simple breakfast food but it was just okay don't know what the big fuss is about this place.. their bacon was good and their strawberry preserves that came with their toast were pretty good.. (bought couple jars to take home) but their hash browns were greasy and the waffles my boyfriend got he said were just okay.. I don't think I'll be coming back but now I can say at least I try the placed out.."}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything was made from scratch and taste homemade. I would definitely recommend giving Matts a try, you won't be disappointed. The service was great! (Art took great care of us)."}
{"text":"I wouldnt recommend this place for vegetarians, as they have zilch, excpet for pancakes, toast, omlette and stuff, for which I can go to ihop next door to me. The omelettes for vegetarians doesnt make the cut for me as on top of not having too many options for vegetarians, they charge much for every single topping on it.  The place isnt as big as the name suggests ;) but I love places like that which remind of an old house converted into an eatery. dont get me wrong, but the place is too small, but is super popular in circles, so expect a long wait time, we waited for 30 mins for 2 PM on a Tuesday.  But the price suits well for the Big in the name, the servings arent as big though as the name suggests. I like the build of the place, but I am not going here again."}
{"text":"How do biscuits and gravy SUCK here!!!? And it's supposedly a daily special?? Bluh...first time here and I thought it sucked. Muppy biscuits and soggy.   2 stars because they have stevia on the tables."}
{"text":"The food was good but nothing special on the menu - same old breakfast - bacon and eggs, pancakes, etc.  They do have one special per day, but again, same old, same old - Sunday was steak and eggs.  Also disappointed there was no alcohol on the menu - I love a good Bloody Mary or a Mimosa on the weekend.  Extremely loud inside, chairs constantly scraping on the concrete floor.    I prefer the Matt's at the airport."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place when I went a few weeks ago.  I hear that there is usually a long wait to get in, when I went I was lucky enough to only wait about 5 minutes before there was a table ready for us, but then again I went at 11 am on a Tuesday so I think that helped a bit.    I went on the advice of a family member.  What I wish had been mentioned was the process of how you put your name in for a table.  There is a notebook outside the front door where you write your name and the number of people in your party on.    The coffee i had was AMAZING, and it set high expectations for the meal which were definitely met.  I had a special for that day (egg scramble with artichoke chicken sausage and gruyere cheese I believe) with sourdough toast and a side of the homefries.  I would eat this meal again in a heartbeat.  Everything was incredibly fresh down to the homemade strawberry jam.    This is a place I definitely want to go back to."}
{"text":"Really good french toast and coffee was excellent. Came in on a Saturday before 0900 and waited for only 5 minutes. Staff were friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"my best friend and I went to Matt's Big Breakfast a few weeks ago after I read the rave reviews here on yelp.  postitives: free parking, HUGE portions, delicious food taste just like your grandmothers big yummy breakfast, really cute and quaint decor, we were seated immediately, great location downtown phoenix. I ordered the cheese omelet, it came quick and it was gigantor and delicious, thick slices of toast came with it and my hashbrows were the best I've ever tasted in life  negatives: it can not be underemphasized how miniature this place is, very small menu options, cost is a bit inflated  I recommend it for a try."}
{"text":"So bomb! Bottomless coffee is what I like to hear when going into a breakfast joint. Very homey cool vibe to it. Very laid back. Felt like I could go here all scrubby or more casual and cute. I went here with three other people when we woke up one morning and we all got different things for about $10 each. Supppppper good prices!! Service wasn't that great I would say though. Over all rly good and I am wanting to go back."}
{"text":"The best waffle of your entire life awaits you at Matt's Big Breakfast!! It is absolute delectable fluffy yet crispy goodness! Also one VERY important note: the waffle automatically comes with REAL maple syrup; none of that disgusting liquid sugar crap here! And, yes, the serving size of maple syrup the waffle cones with is totally plenty and you do not need to pay the charge for extra syrup! It's the late (sleep in on the weekends) brunch spot of choice for my husband and I when we want some great food - rather breakfast or lunch! And if you're feeling lunchy instead of breakfasty the Butter Burger, or my personal favorite, The Rueben are the perfect choices!  Okay...why are you still reading this review?!?! Go to Matt's - go now!!"}
{"text":"If I had to wait for Matt's, I don't think I would like it so much. I mean, it's good, but it's not \"I will wait an hour in the Phoenix summer\" good.  Fortunately, I've live across the street from Matt's and discovered they have takeout! There is nothing better than walking out with my takeout while people who have been waiting for an hour enviously stare."}
{"text":"I had high expectations after seeing them on Diner's Drive Ins and Drives, and they were exceeded!  We went at around 10:30am on a Wednesday and there was about a 30 minute wait.  It was myself, my wife, and our two kids (3 and 5).  We had a waffle, griddle cakes, and the 'Hog and Chick'.  The waffle was amazing, it went quick between the kids and my wife.  The griddle cakes were good as well, and didn't last much longer.  I had the Hog and Chick with sausage patties, hash browns and wheat toast.  The sausage was great, most likely from the Pork Shop (as well as the bacon), the eggs were pefect, and the hash browns were very good as well.  Even the toast was excellent and came with local strawberry preserves.  I can't wait to go back.  Once we got inside, the service was very good and quick.  We were in and out in just about an hour total, half of which was waiting outside."}
{"text":"Do check out! Today was my first experience at Matts & I would recommend this delicious breakfast/lunch spot! Impressed with Ample parking, short wait time. The employees were all very nice and accommodating. The menu is small but covers all bases: pancakes, scrambled, & breakfast sandwich. Our breakfast was prepared quickly! I really appreciated they use cage free eggs, extra virgin olive oil, & real butter! I was pleasantly surprised to see all of the improvements to downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"After a few times of walking past the group of hungry patrons waiting for their table at Matt's Big Breakfast, it was about time to stop in and try it myself. It was certainly worth the wait, and there is definitely nothing small about the breakfast. I had the special of the morning - three egg scramble with provolone, chicken sausage and spinach, and Sean S. had the griddlecakes. My scramble was the perfect mix of egg-y cheesy deliciousness for a Sunday morning breakfast. The home fries it came with were also mouthwatering. I think onions and fresh rosemary can make any potato taste good, and Matt's certainly had mastered this mix. I did try some of Sean's griddlecakes, and they were perfection - melt in your mouth, fluffy, and buttery. Finally, the service and the atmosphere were great. I don't think my waistline could handle Matt's often, but the breakfast is worth the indulgence occasionally."}
{"text":"I thought the food was very basic. We started out with Mimosas (because hello we were going to Hawaii)... It came out as a full glass of champaign (yes, please) and you got to add orange juice. We got the burrito and Matt's Big Breakfast to share... It cost about 50.00, which I wasn't surprised since we were at the airport. Our waiter was excellent, very very funny guy!!"}
{"text":"My SJ buddies and I came here for breakfast one weekday morning.  Now I know why Matt's gets such great reviews.  The only draw back to Matt's is that it is just so small.  But then again, that is part of it's charm.  This is a tiny little house on a corner in downtown Phoenix.  I can just imagine what the weight is like on the weekends.  They have great fresh food and coffee.  I had the \"Hog an Chick\" meat and eggs....applewood smoked bacon...YUM!!  And the potatoes reminded me of my Uncle Ernie's potatoes.  So good with herbs and onions.  I gobbled up every bite!!  My coffee cup was never empty and the sourdough toast was .....mmmmm toasty.  I loved Matt's.  Just be sure to bring lots of quarters because there is nothing but metered parking all around."}
{"text":"When I used to live in Phoenix I would be here a majority of my mornings! The Staff is so friendly and the food is high quality. I always stick with the classic bacon and eggs with some coffee, but I've had friends get the sausauge and steak which I tasted to make sure it wasn't poison...and I haven't tried anything that wasn't good! Part of what makes this place so good is the atmosphere. A tiny, trailer-esque diner? Sign me up! If there is a wait they usually have some water or lemonade to sip on while you wait....but the table turnover isn't too long, so it's nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in Arizona hands down! Every time I have visitors from out of town I suggest this for breakfast. Even when they were at the smaller location I would bring my friends from CA there when I used to live in downtown. I come here a lot with my man and the family and it is never disappointing. The prices are unbeatable for the quality of the food. My favorite item that they serve is their hash browns. I can't put my finger on what make them so delicious, they just are. My last visit they served us burned hash browns but they fixed it right away with the delicious hash browns that I love so much. I usually get some coffee and share a five spot with Eric. The five spot is an amazing breakfast sandwich that has thick bacon, egg, cheese and grilled onions all on delicious bread. When we have a crazier appetite we go for the five spot with an order of waffles. WOW. Unbelievably yummy. There's usually a wait but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"One of the worst dinning experience of my life. Checked in with a party of three and was told the wait was 20-30mins after waiting almost an hour and a half and watching four other parties get seated before mine (was told no room for a party my size even though they sat a group of three that checked in after us) only to be seated and have our waitress take the order of a party of 8 that was seated after us was the last straw! If your going to go to eat here make sure you have an extra two hours to kill..."}
{"text":"If you like breakfast and everything it stands for, you've got to come to Matt's.  The reviews on Yelp sent me here, and I'm so glad they did.  The food is delicious, and buttery, and fatty.  But if you know in advance what you're getting in to, there's no room for complaints.  The food isn't healthy to put it mildly, but it's delicious. And it's perfect if you're hungover.  Seriously.  Go have breakfast here, take a nap when you get home and you'll be good to go.    Be advised that there is quite a wait on the weekends.  I had to wait around 35 minutes the time I went, but after reading all the reviews, I knew what to expect, so I didn't mind it. Good food usually means a considerable wait, so just suck it up and go anyways.  Once you try the food, you'll forget you had to sit outside for 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Can't believe it took me so long to try this place! Heard about it from friends and of course saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and I had been wanting to try it forever but just never had the chance. I finally tried it with some friends and WOW was it good! I had the salami scramble which was DELICIOUS! Never though of putting salami in eggs but I knew I had to try it and it was really delicious...the eggs and salami combo was really tasty. Got that with hash browns and sourdough toast...I have to say, the hash browns were the BEST I've ever tasted. I have no idea what they do to them to make them so good but they were amazing! Very crunchy too which I love. The toast and coffee were quite good as well, and I can't wait to try the pancakes next time!! Best breakfast I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Ok, folks. I liked this place but it wasn't an OMG jaw dropping experience for me. I appreciate the freshness of the ingredients and the simple presentation. Cannot complain at all about the service (great hospitality from everyone we encountered!) on a very busy Sunday morning. I had the Five Spot, hub had the Belgian Waffle. Both were fresh, hot, and made with good ingredients, but I'm not sure it's worth the drive across town and waiting an hour for (thank you for having inside waiting areas for these hot days.) Giving it four stars on ingredients and hospitality. Otherwise, it would be a solid three."}
{"text":"Excellent food! It not as good as the original, but it's great to have some local food in the airport."}
{"text":"I had been to the original location and thought I would checkout the newer one on camelback.  Was quickly seated at the bar.  Exceptionally clean and very busy.   Ordered a cheese omelet, side of bacon, with hash browns.   Everything was delicious and tasted very fresh.   I actually give this location a slight edge to the original once."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast place! Very trendy. The restaurant was very busy when I came in snuck in at the counter. Service was stellar. I had the waffle with bacon. I would highly recommend it. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I would have given this restaurant 4 stars except they charged us $1.50 for extra syrup. That just seemed petty and honestly put a damper on the meal. Really Matt??  Come on!  What next?  Charging for an extra squirt of ketchup?  The food overall is solid but they should rethink this policy. Why put a bad taste in customers' mouths over a buck?"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Matt's every Monday for two years now and we love it!!! Everything on the menu is fresh and served hot!! The special of the day is amazing and the waffles are perfect!!"}
{"text":"Most amazing breakfast I have ever had in my travels. So much food, service is friendly and fast.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good but not great like I heard it was, pork didn't have much flavor at all, waffles were pretty good though"}
{"text":"Overall delicious food. I am not a breakfast person, but I wound up going here for a family member's birthday and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the Five Spot, an egg and cheese sandwich with bacon and onions. I loved it. It was extremely satisfying, great service from the waitresses, and fairly reasonable prices. The only downside was that it was very busy and the menu was very limited."}
{"text":"I love going into this restaurant. A dear friend and I would go here back in the day. I hardly doubt yelpers had even yelped this house yet. It has a super special place in my heart.  I ordered up the eggs and bakie. Comes with tasty hashbrowns. The sourdough toast is thick as is the bacon. The preserves were awesome. Everyone is very attentive and pretty happy.  Congrats Matt on the upcoming move into the old verde house and the front room we have been enjoying breakfast in since 04 becomes Matts fast food takeout. I wish you well. And congrats on having your very own bathroom soon, lol."}
{"text":"Happiest place in Phoenix! Awesome experience all around. The Hot Spot Breakfast sandwich was delish! The place was extremely clean to include the restrooms. The food came out hot, fresh and fast. The vibe in this place is so cool, everyone is smiling and genuinely happy. I asked one of the staff members what was the secret to everyone's super happy demeanor, she told me that everyone really enjoys working here, the management is supportive and you pretty much have to know someone to get a job here which gives it that tight knit family environment. Wish this place was closer to home I would come here everyday just for a dose of happy"}
{"text":"This place has a really good breakfast selection and the food itself is very amazing. The staff was super friendly and able to provide a wonderful service."}
{"text":"It's everything the more flattering reviews say and more - including the wait outdoors. Mine was during a rare Arizona downpour, but even so, it was well worth it.  I waited about half an hour, sharing an umbrella with strangers.  When it was time to be seated, I was asked \"are you ready, honey?\" by a woman who might have been half my age, if that.  Even though the place was cramped and extremely busy, all of the staff were friendly and accommodating.  Not long after being seated, I was poured the first of what turned out to be four cups of delicious, freshly-ground coffee, at which time my order was also taken.  I had the special - 3 scrambled eggs with locally-raised ham, roasted red peppers, and provolone cheese.  It arrived promptly, and was savored thoroughly.  I'm leaving Phoenix in less than 48 hours, but I'm definitely planning a return visit."}
{"text":"You might have to wait if you visit the downtown location but no wait here. They pour a generous mimosa. Their BLT come on fresh sliced bread, with thick slices of bacon. I like to add avocado. The pancakes are perfect and served with real Vermont syrup. Great place to eat before you get on a long flight."}
{"text":"Every part of this breakfast was perfect. The ham was the way God intended country ham to be. Cut the leg off a pig, cure it, smoke it, slice a huge chunk off of it fry it up and eat! The hash browns were....crunchy and creamy. I have never eaten a hash Brown that I considered delicious until today. Topped off with two perfectly fried eggs and thick sliced sourdough toast with home made strawberry preserves....heaven on a plate.  Service was attentive and quick...highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast food. Usually there are great options for non-meat eaters. But this is really a meat-eater's breakfast paradise. We realized during the long (1  1/2 hour) wait that we would have limited offerings, but everyone leaving assured us it was worth the wait and it was too late to get breakfast someplace else.   Matt's served the hottest, best tasting scrambled eggs, amazing coffee and some pretty good pancakes.  My companion ordered the tuna sandwich. Good, but not worth the wait. Four stars for the food, minus the wait and the choices."}
{"text":"Ordered the waffles and omelette special (eggs, andouille sausage, pepper jack cheese, and jalapenos) with homemade fries. Waffles are fantastic if you smear the butter around and mix it with the syrup. Nice and soft. Slightly sweet when waffles are by itself. Bacon that came with the waffles were tasty, as well.  Omelette was flavorful, but a touch of tabasco sauce enhanced the flavor. Homemade fries are delicious. The housemade strawberry jam that came with the toast was delicious, as well. Friendly staff. Very busy here - like a 30 min wait."}
{"text":"How I'd have loved to see a Tofu Scramble or a Vegan Pancake option on the menu for the fellow vegans and vegetarians? Sadly, I had to make by with the oatmeal. My husband had the toast and home fries. The blueberry spread was good. Neat location, inside Marina Heights. 4 stars for the great service."}
{"text":"A simple breakfast menu with consistent good results! The coffee is good and it is a place to go to if you want to meet and get out quick, not the kind of breakfast place you want to linger at, too busy and noisy, but worth those for the food."}
{"text":"First and far most expect to wait if not here by opening. Very popular spot. Pork chops and eggs for me both times. First visit fantastic, second visit not so much... manager had my back.... thank you. I'll definitely be back. Understand this place gets BUSY, so yes servers are doing their best to accommodate... try to avoid the frustration if it takes a little longer than normal to wait... then again reminders don't hurt. You can get eggs anywhere... next time I'll be ordering a special... FYI French toast a definite if having a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"My partner and I took her family to eat at Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix to try a new breakfast place out. It is in a strip mall next to a grocery store. It was very busy and took about 35 minutes to get a seat for 6, no big deal- I just figured this meant that it was good. The service was friendly enough but they seemed understaffed. It was very busy on this Monday morning after Xmas and our table didn't get much attention (no greeting, no goodbye, only 1 coffee refill, etc). There are no vegan options here. I appreciated that the server knew the hash browns were not vegan but the home fries were. She said the beans were vegan but I could not order them as a side only as part of the chilaquiles meal but since I am vegan, I obviously wasn't going to order that. And then my father in law ordered the chilaquiles and the beans came in a small dish on the side. So I ate home fries and drank coffee. The coffee was good and so were the home fries (I asked for jalapeños and onions to be cooked in with them). The rest of the family enjoyed their meals but wished for more attentive service. I would not go back but I think the meat eaters in the family will!"}
{"text":"Mmmm love this place!!!! Love the waffle, and I also really like making my own omelette. It's a nice place to go with friends, family or even by yourself. Gets pretty busy for sure, but I've never really had a huge issue getting in. I feel like Snooze down the street is significantly more difficult to get into... the wait there is like 2 hours! The longest I've waited at Matt's was probably 15 or 20 minutes. Maybe. But delicious food!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Cute little place with a quaint atmosphere. Definitely busy, but the wait wasn't long at all for this location. I had the breakfast sandwich and it was alright. I think I should have gone with the Belgian waffle or pancakes instead, but the sandwich was okay. Everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"The food is good but way over priced, one waffle and a piece of bacon for ten bucks. It had a cool atmosphere, and the people were friendly, maybe I am just to dollar conscious for this place. It was worth it to go once. You won't be disappointed on the quality."}
{"text":"We were so excited to see what all the hype was about... I'm not sure what people think is so great. Three staff members told us about the Tuesday special and how great it was. So hubby and I both ordered it. Then we were told they only have enough for one, so my hubby changes his order. Then another waitress comes and tells us they're completely out, so I also had to change my order. Hubby paid over $14 for the most bland omelette we've ever tasted. And my chicken sandwich was just okay. It was also very bland. The one yummy thing was the hash browns. And they have this great all natural ketchup. That was about it.   Also for a place called \"Matt's big breakfast\" you would expect something to be large about it. Not so much.   The only other upside was the waitresses are very nice and pretty attentive."}
{"text":"Always and I mean always yummmmm! Service fast and friendly. Local,organic market fresh foods! Bacon big flavor."}
{"text":"Service terrible first time and second time. Food small portions and eggs underdone. Sticking with the original downtown . Somewhere customer service and great food lost ."}
{"text":"I had my first experience with Matt's this morning. A friend of mine had seen it on Diner's, Dives and Drive In's (or something along those lines) and was excited to try it out. The wait was about 20 minutes(arrived at 9 am) and seating is very limited but worth it!  I'm all about the breakfast food so I was excited to try somewhere new. The menu is limited but covers all bases. The coffee (a special blend just for them) is local as is everything that they serve. I swear the bacon tastes better when it's from around the corner.  I decided on the belgian waffle and a side of hash browns. SUPER YUMMY!! I appreciate the note on the menu that they only use butter and extra virgin olive oil... No trans fats here! The hash browns were a bit oily but tasty overall.  As I was leaving I saw a huge stack of pancakes on their way to a table... I know what I'm getting next time!!"}
{"text":"We went this morning for breakfast and I was pleasantly surprised. My sister is a student in the area and had been once before so she took us out of Towners.  My mom got the skinny, which was egg whites with chicken sausage and spinach, she's all about that stuff so she loved it. My sister and I both got the hog & chick. I got ham which was a thumbs up & sister got bacon. Both delicious. Step dad for the special which was steak and eggs. The steak really impressed me, not only was it cooked perfectly, it was a nice thick piece of meat, they don't cut corners. The toast might have been everyone's favorite part of breakfast, even my carb hating mother. I didn't give 5 stars because I wish they had a bigger menu, just a few more choices!! :)"}
{"text":"Breakfast, as good as it gets! The food, YUM!  The service, outstanding! The vibe, hipster chill. The wait at 8:45 on a Sunday morning, 5-10 minutes. Phew, I would have happily waited 30 minutes.  Matt, I applaud you for taking the time to prepare everything from scratch with only the finest ingredients.  It shows in the homemade belgian waffles with sweet creamery butter & real maple syrup, the thick sliced peppery & oh so perfect bacon, the omelets made with Wisconsin cheddar, the rosemary home fries, the breakfast sandwich, the fresh-squeezed OJ and, of course, the bottomless cup of locally roasted dark roast coffee.    I can only imagine how good their biscuits & sausage gravy would be... if they had them, but I love a restaurant that does a few things very well, instead of trying to be all things to all people."}
{"text":"Sunny side up eggs were perfect which is not all that common. Thick cut peppered bacon was perfectly crispy, thich cut rye, and amazing rosemary potatoes. Coffee refills were also served promptly. This place in the airport rivals some popular breakfast joints in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Seriously as good as it looked on Food Network.  bacon was top quality.  I got the special which was chipotle cheddar sausage scramble and a side of bacon.  honestly the star may have been the strawberry lemonade though.  fresh made with strawberry puree it was delicious.  thank god for the time difference we got there early enough the wait was only 20 minutes.  a million thumbs up"}
{"text":"Busy diner, but worth the wait. Their flavored lemonades are fresh and on point. Would visit this again when back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! Had this place on my list and it didn't disappoint! Came on a Thursday morning, no wait, small crowd. The food and drinks came pretty quickly. I had eggs, potatoes and bacon which is great. I was very impressed with the flavor, portions and overall experience. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"You know it's good when you have a line out the door and cold water outside to keep you hydrated. Great place, tremendous food and good portions. Love this place!"}
{"text":"So I was excited to find out there was this location.  I visited the one downtown a few times and it was always amazing.   I came to this location and first off my waitress was so weird and like high, she's like I'm sorry I just need coffee. Im like okay, we ordered food. I liked my boyfriends rosemary potatoes the best. Everything else sucked. My bacon looked great but fell apart when I bit down,  too hard and too crunchy for my liking. Beef jerky would have been better than that bacon.  The waffle was okay.   Overall, disappointed. I was so sad walking out."}
{"text":"Love,Love,Love Matt's and I am loving the new location right across the parking lot from my work. My new breakfast spot from now on"}
{"text":"My husband and I are pretty new to the area and we found Matt's Big Breakfast and were pretty impressed with their breakfast fare... until our last recent visit just yesterday.  I decided not to order my usual 5-spot breakfast sandwich and had the Hog & Chick menu item for a change.  I ordered my eggs over easy and hashbrowns, instead of the country potatoes.  All three of us order the hashbrowns and all three of us were very disappointed.  The hashbrowns were soggy, lukewarm, and almost the consistency of mashed potatoes in the middle.  Yuck!  My easy over eggs still had runny whites all around the yolk... double yuck!!  The only saving grace was the yummy bacon.  The food certainly wasn't worth waiting in line to get in the joint.  If we go back, I would stick with the 5-spot breakfast sandwich and the country potatoes."}
{"text":"Wonderful place...terrific menu selections very unique all fresh natural local Ingredients...in a lovely comfy, casual  atmosphere with fast, friendly service...no surprise it's a local and national hit...try all 4..!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visting Phoenix this past week. We looked on Yelp for a recommendation for a great breakfast place that wasn't far from our hotel downtown.   Boy were we happy we found Matts! It was Thursday morning and the wait was only about 10 minutes. The restaurant is small and lively. The service was fast and friendly. And the food was FANTASTIC!   I got the H & C - with delicious thick cut peppered bacon and fluffy scrambled eggs. The hashbrowns were delicous and the thick slices of sourdough toast with raspberry preserves completed the meal. The coffee was also very good. My husband had the salami scramble and thought it was very tasty as well.   Matt's was one of the highlights of our week!"}
{"text":"Very friendly welcome when u walk in. I walked from the Sheraton on N.3rd, nice quick walk. I ordered The Five Spot platter with the strawberry honey lemonade. It was DELICIOUS. Grilled sweet onions gave it a great flavor. I normally don't eat onions with my food, but the sweet flavor mad it worth it. It's an upscale Bacon, Egg & Cheese sandwich for my fellow city New Yorkers."}
{"text":"My family and I parked our asses at the breakfast bar after a 45 minute wait.  And had a perfect breakfast.  Ernie was delightful to chat with, but more importantly, the breakfasts were spot on.  Great cakes, great scramble, amazing chunky breakfast potatoes, and am I imagining it or did I get served a bloody mary?  Hey, a guy can dream.  :)"}
{"text":"Great food, nice place. A little pricey but a good experience."}
{"text":"The only breakfast meals that my husband likes are pancakes and waffles, and he is very particular about them. He was not impressed with NCounter's Belgian waffle, but he gave 5 stars to the waffles here. They are served with real maple syrup and are a generous portion.   I had eggs, bacon, homefries, and toast, and my meal was delicious and fueled me into much of the afternoon. You can tell that the ingredients here are fresh. The slices of bacon were thick, and the bread from which my toast slices were cut was made that morning.   The entrance to the restaurant is located within the State Farm complex, with a few parking spots available directly in front of the restaurant. We walked from the AC Hotel along the bike path. Our service was friendly and quick. When we travel and eat out, we try to explore as many different restaurants as possible, but this place was so good we were both tempted to have breakfast here again!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  They are supposed to open at 6:30.  At 6:50 we're still waiting to seated because \"we've gotten a late  start\".  Then, someone, a server, finally suggested to the manager sitting with her coffee playing around on her lap top, that they could open the to go place line only. I'm sorry, but I have no patience with business owners / bad managers that can't get their stuff together.  Great way to kill s business.  I know I will NEVER PATRONIZE THIS  ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN."}
{"text":"I had a very nice meal here. My waffle was absolutely delightful, bacon was flavorful and crispy like I had asked for, and the blueberry lemonade was so refreshing. I wasn't a huge fan of the home fries just because I like them much crispier and these were honestly pretty mushy. My grandma said her pork chop was bland but still tender and tasted better with A1 sauce. All of the employees were welcoming and attentive. I would've liked to have seen some more sweet breakfast options, perhaps with fresh fruit or something like that. All in all, a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place  Had a work breakfast and came away impressed. Nice restaurant design and things were spotless.  Service crew was super nice and quick to tend to everything we could ask for.  Drinks were on our table within two minutes of order, breakfast plates hit about fine minutes after the waitress walked away, and drinks were always refilled.  Food was very good, though we ordered the basics. I'll take my family to try some sweeter carb fare.  If they rave, I'll update and give a fifth star.  They're a true Phoenix gem!"}
{"text":"Does anyone else have mega love for their patio? The food and service is always on point, it's the homestyle hospitality that gives you all the mom-and-pop feels! And the hash browns, so so so good. Definitely recommend for a no-fuss breakfast in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Matt's is in a league all it's own! Accidently stumbled upon it today when going to the new Mountainside Fitness located in the StateFarm Mega Campus surrounding Tempe Town Lake. Considering my wife and I are absolute foodies to the core, we both dropped the ball on this place! As in how have we not heard of and already made this gem a regular in our good eats rotation!   Now for the food!   Me: The Five Spot, 2 eggs real butter cage free, 2 ridiculously thick pieces of suculant bacon, Wisconsin cheddar on a hand made roll! This thing was 5 bucks... Get real! I'd show you if I didnt eat it too fast!.  Wife: Cheese Ommlett: honestly we didnt speak the entire meal nor have time to look at each other's plates; too concentrated and focused on each and ever bite! So, it was spectacular or my wife would have been chatting away as usual!   Please if for no other reason you come here though, at least venture in to have a glass of the no lie 100% winner of a prize I will only give out once in this lifetime...... World's Best Lemonade Period... Ok so this award won't be featured in the NY Times, and I don't have a plaque or ribbon, however you do have permission to add this prestigious title to your official menu!

Let me solve the dilema of having options, and point you to the lakeside eatery I've been to only once and know where all future breakfast\brunch\lunch dollars will go if we are eating out!   PS stellar service, every single staff member was vigiliant, respectful, and happy. Had a Trader Joe staff kind of feel if you know what I mean!"}
{"text":"Excellent little breakfast place. A great local hangout but come early to beat the crowd. Service is quick and polite w many friendly faces.   Breakfast menu is all natural ingredients. Haven't tried the lunch menu yet but it all looks good.  You will definitely feel full when leaving!"}
{"text":"Always worth the wait! You can taste the quality and freshness in each bite. You can't go wrong with the pancakes, just make sure you are prepared to take home leftovers. The jams is a must so make sure you order a side of toast to try."}
{"text":"everything has pepper on it, the bacon overcooked with bacon, potatoes has rosemary all over it. If you did not want something that is comes with, could not get substitutions, the tea is awful, do not have plain tea, when asked for tea bag, they gave you one and charged extra for every tea bag, service was awful and place small, this is not the best place at all for breakfast I do not care what anyone says, it is GROSS, there are better places then this."}
{"text":"This breakfast was very very basic and quite gross. I found a long piece of hair on my toast and my waffle was undercooked. Feel sick after eating here don't eat at matts big breakfast."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing!!! The food, the atmosphere, the staff, the food, did I mention the food?  My family of 4 all picked something different, and we all said ours was the best, so of course we had to try everyone else's.  We were all right.  You can't go wrong, there is something for every pallet and appetite.  It is cozy, so be prepared to wait and sit close to other satisfied diners.  We lucked out and sat next to an amazing retired couple from Sacramento.  Eat here NOW!!!"}
{"text":"This is a must visit. The place is small and simple, yet if you go at the wrong time you'll wait in line. Luckily,  we went early and ate at the bar. The service was great, the food was great, and the bacon was off the charts!"}
{"text":"If you are ever in Tempe, Arizona just outside of Phoenix, then go to Matt's Big Breakfast for food that will not disappoint:)  Located in Marina Heights near the State Farm building, this famous Arizona breakfast branch is nice and clean, and ready to take your order.  I ordered the pork chop with 2 overhard eggs, home fries with rosemary, and wheat toast with a side of berry jam.  The bottomless coffee was very good especially with the small tin of milk versus creamer provided.  The rosemary was prevalent in the pork chop that was perfectly cooked and succulent in taste.  Speaking of succulent, there was also a succulent as a table decoration that added a touch of Arizona.  The highlight was the addition of thick cut bacon I ordered to compliment my meal, which were 3 apple smoked and peppered pieces that were so crispy and flavorful, I wanted to hug Matt and thankfully say \"now this is how bacon should taste!\"  This organic farm to table type establishment was an excellent representation of what a modern breakfast in Arizona should taste like and worth eating on a placeMatt;)"}
{"text":"Cool vibe, very friendly staff and really good food. If you're downtown this is a great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Mmm...my buddy suggested this tasty place while continuing to validate the original esteemed praise from \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\".  We split the Tuesday Special of Biscuits & Gravy and ohhhh am I satisfied.  Get the side of thick bacon.  Matt's has a kind atmosphere and a young service that is very attentive. We always had water in our glasses, (and she always remembered to keep the ice from me! ) There was misbehaving couple whose toddler was continually blasting screams, but we were still able to appreciate the designed experience.  I'll happily return when in Phoenix. There's probably a weekend line, but it'll be worth the wait..."}
{"text":"Great menu, albeit limited.  Unique dishes that make it hard to choose."}
{"text":"This place is the best breakfast in town. It used to be so easy to get a table too until Guy Fierri  had them on his show and now you wait at least 45 mins for a table.  But the food is so good OMG it is still worth it. It is so tiny but the food is huge!! The fresh fruit preserves on the homemade bread, the home fries with fresh rosemary and caramelized onions, yummy sunny side up eggs with a GIANT piece of ham. I just cannot stress enough how mouth watering delicious this little gem is :)"}
{"text":"I love breakfast and their breakfast is my favorite, but that is beside the point. A lot of places make good food but I don't review a lot of places. I'm taking the time to write this because every time I come here I'm blown away by the service. These men and women hustle. Few places in the valley keeps a staff that even pretends to be accommodating. There is usually a line out the door. The staff is always moving, always seating customers, always following up and getting food out. I love it."}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwich was incredible!  The bun is a cross between a bagel & croissant. The waffle was the best I've had - 100% maple syrup  Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"This place is seriously on point.  My wife and I are here with some friends for spring training.  We were told to come here for breakfast and it was probably the best breakfast I've ever had.  The location is great, food is awesome and great customer service.  Blake was our server and he was on top of everything.  He took our order promptly and was quick worth he drinks.  I had about 5-6 iced teas and never had to wait.  Then the food came.  Omg! Amazing.  I had the Chop and Chick, my wife had the special scramble and our friends had the Hog and Chick.  We will definitely be back next time we are in Phx.     Thx again!!!!"}
{"text":"The service is on point. Best service I have ever seen, and they are super efficient. But you only get to see this is you arrie well before 9:30 or there will be a minimum of an hour wait.  Luckily we got here at 8 am.. and it was great. The coffee is roasted in cave creek, and being a coffee snob I fully approve.  Pancakes amazing Breakfast sandwhich - minus bacon + sausage patty = WOW the spices on that patty were incredible Omlette special - I was jealouse my friend ordered this and I didnt.. I almost took it from here and ended our friendship so I could enjoy her food on my own Hasbrowns - mor elike hash mashed potatoes with amazing spices and the best hash I have had in a while  Toast - YES THE TOAST IS GOOD. How can toast be worth mentioning... because it is."}
{"text":"I've been to Matt's Big Breakfast twice. I was not impressed by the long wait or the atmosphere. It  was small and dingy. The bathroom in the dive hotel next door was really disgusting.  I did enjoy the food though. The first time I got an *egg white and vegetable omelet*, which was ok. It was fresh, which was good. The real stand out for me was the *toast*, they said they said it was local and the bakery sold at the farmers market around the corner. It was really delicious. I also enjoyed the *hashbrowns*, they were greasy but yummy. They used a spice that I couldn't discern. I think it was a little bit of nutmeg. It really popped.   The second time we went, I got the *egg salad sandwich*. It was well balanced. Same good bread. I got a side of hashbrowns, because I enjoyed them the first time.   My husband wasn't impressed at all. He thought his omelet was average and didn't really care for the atmosphere.  Because of the cost, and atmosphere, I don't think we will be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere. Best breakfast in PHX"}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan! I tried Matt's Griddlecakes and Salami Scramble. Also tried the freshly squeezed orange juice and sipped on their coffee.   Here's what I liked -- the griddlecakes are 3 stacked pancakes with \"mystery\" ingredients. It seems like they infused the pancakes with butter and milk. They place sweet cream butter on top! Please make sure to share this plate! It's very sweet and I could only eat half! They also mention to give real maple syrup on the side, which is a nice touch. I'm just a tad skeptical though if it is real.   I do like their hash browns and salami scramble. It's a little on the salty side, but it is tasty! The orange juice to my surprise did taste great! I would definitely recommend this place to a friend!"}
{"text":"A little confusing walking into the side entrance for take-away. I almost thought it was a order and then sit down establishment. Once we found the hostess stand and were seated the food I must say was good. the service however I must admit for not good. No refill on my coffee, waitress never came back to check on us and I ended up having to ask for the check from whom I believe was a manager."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food and drink, not so much. I had the chorizo scramble with country style potatoes. The potatoes weren't cooked evenly, because they weren't cut the same. Some pieces small and overcooked, some pieces huge and raw. I definitely didn't care for getting a huge rosemary stem in one bite either, gross! I ordered the blueberry lemonade with honey. The blueberry tartness was there, and the lemon sourness was there, but the sweetness of the honey was definitely missing. I didn't drink half of it. It's too bad that the food standards were lacking, because the service was upstanding. I won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Not sure about all the reviews here?  This place was so LOUD that you couldn't even have a conversation.  The food was mediocre at best.  Not bad, just nothing special.  Same waffles at an IHOP for example.  You know that little metal pitcher of syrup you get with a waffle, the tiny size...well, if you want more syrup ... that's another 1.50$ please.   So, the prices are fine, family of 4 for 50$, but not worth going back to for the ambience for sure... my ears are still ringing ."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with some friends. Had the griddle cakes and hash browns which were so good! I am definitely ordering the honey lemonade next time. The only downside to the place was the noise."}
{"text":"After all the raving I have heard about Matt's Big Breakfast and the long wait I was so excited to enjoy my food. The quality of the ingredients were high; however, the service was not so great. I felt that the waitresses were attempting to rush us out of the restaurant. I realize that it is a busy place, but their overt pushiness was not warranted.   Overall I would not go back again. The food was made with great ingrediants, but it just didn't \"do it \" for me."}
{"text":"Can't believe what a great breakfast place this is at the airport they need to open all over the valley if you are in terminal B ask for Katie she rocks!!! Great friendly customer service !!!"}
{"text":"This is not a place for the calorie conscious, so dieters need to swear off this place like the plague. Even the salads here are smothered in bacon, eggs, cheese and dressing. But if you feel like punishing your arteries in the most delicious fashion, I highly recommend Matt's Big Breakfast. I've heard from just about everyone I know that this place is the bee's knees, the elephant's eyebrows, the eel's hips...and the buzz wasn't wrong.   This place has some amazing hangover food, so after a night of indulging we arrived at this little diner around noon thirty and had to wait about twenty minutes to be seated. The temperature was well over 100 degrees by that point, which is not good on the dehydrated and hung over, but they were kind enough to provide a giant tub of ice water so that waiting diners didn't drop like flies before they could be served. Two stacks of complimentary foodie magazines were also present for perusal, but my brain didn't feel like thinking yet. However, by the time we were done with our dining experience at one twenty, there were empty booths all over the place, so if you're impatient, go during the last hour they're open.  Once inside, we sat at the bar, right in the path of the air conditioning vent, with a clear view of the kitchen going ons. Seeing how I drank my share of water outside I ordered an RC Cola (I didn't even know that brand still existed!) that came in a can. While waiting to order, I did some pretty extreme rubbernecking, judging the deliciousness of every dish that came out of the kitchen or was being munched on by others. The menu was modest in size but boasted that they used the freshest organic ingredients whenever possible, and after watching everyone else I was pretty excited when the time came to order.   I decided to go with my traditional breakfast fare, so I could accurately compare it to other brunch joints: eggs over medium, bacon, hashbrowns and sour dough toast. The Hog and Chick!  And. It. Was. Heaven.  It's clear that everything they offered was as fresh as it could possibly be. The toast tasted freshly baked, doughy yet crisp, and was delicious dipped in my eggs. Thick cut peppered bacon melted in my mouth. The hashbrowns had to have been made on the premises, because they looked exactly like the ones I make in my own home, greyer than the freezer variety and a bit gelatinous. There was even a tiny tub of fresh apricot puree that tasted like there wasn't a lick of processed sugar added.   And everything was drowned to a lovely crisp in butter.  I only wish it were in Tempe instead of Phoenix, because I'd love to try the other menu offerings. It's cheap, delicious, friendly, and some of the best damn hang over food I have ever had."}
{"text":"Second time here.  Great food and service both time.  Perfect example of keeping it simple and reciting well.  Wife had the cheese omelet and I had steak and eggs (Sunday special).  Everything was cooked perfectly and the steak was tender and flavorful.  Would definitely recommend for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"Fun staff. Sit at the bar. Mamacita burger add egg was awesome"}
{"text":"While waiting outside, the fresh smell of BACON & waffles are waffling thru the air on the patio. There's a bird whistling a happy tune while the patrons come in and out of this small red brick building. When you cross the threshold to the other side, you are greeted the the diner atmosphere to the smell of fresh bacon.  Freshly squeezed OJ & lemonade are on the menu w/ the freshest ingredients known to man kind.. Hence due to the caption on the back of the menu with the smell of waffle & bacon waffling around my senses.   -Did I mention the smell of bacon? ..probably Ooh three or four times already. That's how good it smells while tantalizing my sense of smell.  I can't wait to get in the door to the kingdom that's is Matt's."}
{"text":"Five stars alone for the perfect crispy, buttery char on the hash browns and for the wonderfully loaded and homemade jam with a fat piece of wheat toast. The eggs, over easy were perfectly cooked and the pork chop was nicely seared and had a great flavor on it. The bacon was fat and crispy as well. Everything I had was well done and makes me want to go back on a Monday so I can try their heuvos ranchero with green chile sauce.   Friendly staff, nice ambiance, and an owner or manager who walked around and checked on customers. It was well worth the trip downtown"}
{"text":"A good restaurant. Always very busy.  Don't confuse the Midwest Chilli with Cincinnati Chilli.  It is not over spaghetti."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been going here for years. The service and food are always great. I would recommend the steak and egg omelette special that they usually have on the weekends. Everything else I have had is great as well."}
{"text":"Great Food! Better Environment!  Visited this place solely because I it was on \"Diner, Drive-ins and Dives\" soon realized what all the fuzz was about. Sure there is a long wait but it went by fast. All food was made with the freshest ingredient and portions were well served."}
{"text":"The PERFECT Breakfast :)  If only I could have this every day :)  Matt's is all you want a breakfast spot to be...cute, friendly and the most amazing food out there.  I highly recommend the hog and chick.  You just can't go wrong with eggs*, bacon*, home fries* (get the home fries, not the hashbrowns) and their toast* served with Terra Verde Farms preserves.  * = best ever, ever, ever  I could write on and on...you've seen the reviews.  Just make sure to make it there, you won't be sorry, you'll be addicted!"}
{"text":"Best bacon I've ever had at a restaurant, and I'm a farm girl!!  Everything was farm fresh and high quality...highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not much to add that everyone else hasn't already said, this place lived up to our expectations. The waffle was pure heaven, I'm sure I could have inhaled it if no one was looking. The thick cut bacon will make you question all other bacon you've ever had. Ham off the bone? A religious experience. Both the honey lemonade and the fresh-squeezed orange juice should be sipped like fine wine. Go here. Bring someone with you so you can steal food from them. Seriously.  Besides the food, the service was wonderful. Our waitress was extremely attentive and personable even though the restaurant was busy. The wait wasn't as bad as some make it out to be, be patient and your chance to enter Valhalla will come."}
{"text":"Just arrived in Phoenix last night and was looking for a place for breakfast. We picked Matts Big Breakfast based on Yelp reviews and because it was close to the Sheraton.  We got there about 7:30 and had no trouble getting a seat but by 8:15 or so people waiting in line.  First of all, the waitstaff were fantastic. They must do some sort of \"collaborative\" serving here because it seemed as though every single one of them was taking care of us.  It was not as though they were constantly interrupting our meal to ask us if we needed anything, they were quite simply on top of taking care of our every need regardless of which one of them happened to walk by.  I ordered the eggs Benedict with a side of bacon because that was the Thursday special and it was fantastic. I would definitely come back for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I got the waffle breakfast with bacon and eggs. It was delicious.  My boyfriend got the steak and eggs cooked to perfection and my friend got the special of the day that she was happy with. It seems like there is a very low chance of being disappointed at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have always loved Matt's Big Breakfast.  The staff is always friendly, and very knowledgeable about specials and the downtown area.  Matt's restaurant is  located in an awesome area, located centrally in downtown Phoenix!  It is adjacent to the Phoenix farmers market and other local restarants.    Due to Matt's popularity, it is extremely busy with limited seating.  However due to the quality of their food and customer service it is well worth the wait in my opinion!  My girlfriend and I were told there would be a wait time of about 25 min.  We went to walk around and when we came back we had already been called.  The waitress in the front told us that it's okay and sat us as the next seats became available.  It's things like that, that seperate mediocre service to superb service and I will always be a customer of Matt's for that!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast in Phoenix!  Real ingredients, real people and really good. I get the same thing EVERY time I visit. Waffle (with real maple syrup) + extra crispy thick butcher cut bacon + crispy hashbrowns (grilled in real butter - you can really taste it). This meal is not for the diet conscious. Hubby always gets the Chop n Chick (as seen on Diner's Drive Ins & Dives) - this is tasty too!  Simple, no frills food with outstanding taste. LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"We are from out of state and were looking forward to today's breakfast for some time.  I had a cheese omelette, country potatoes, toast, and a side of bacon. The country potatoes were so greasy making  them inedible. I asked for hot sauce and was given a bottle of their own hot sauce that tasted more like barbecue sauce minus any kick. Nothing particularly special about this place or the service, although it is pretty cute."}
{"text":"Since we were on vacation and Guy Fiere had suggested a breakfast place my wife agreed to go to Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix. This place may have converted my wife to becoming a breakfast liker.  Though there menu below is kinda of lite on options. Nine breakfast items and if your there after 11am you can choose from another nine lunch items. If it wasn't for Guy Fiere featuring them on them twice on the Food Network we would have skipped this place. How could any of these common breakfast items be so good to wait in line for about forty-five minutes.  Overall the restaurant can hold maybe about fifty people. I wouldn't suggest this place if you had a party of more then four. They really don't have room to combine a whole lot of tables. Also they don't quote wait times be scared, be very scared or bring a newspaper or your phone with a 2 person game like we did. We like playing Connect 4 it's an easy game but both of us are pretty competitive, so time passes fast.   We got seated at the bar, the service was prompt. We ordered coffee's, Griddle Cakes and The Chop and Chicks. Took under fifteen minutes to get our food out. The food was hot and smelled amazing.  According to my wife these are the best pancakes the ever! She almost couldn't put the fork down. They were really light, sweet and fluffy pancakes. It was served with a nice dollop of butter and warm maple syrup."}
{"text":"4 stars only cuz the wait is sooooo long! Outside - line around the block, no lie. Good food! Matt can cook! The food is great but when I want to eat, I want to eat!!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place. We were referred to by a good friend of my girlfriend and we said that we should try it since all of the other places didn't appeal to us.   When u walk up to this location the have some kinda corral outside of it. Idk what's that about but whatever. This place had a nice atmosphere and seem really bizzy like it was a good local hang out. The staff was friendly which make it a plus.   The food was mediocre and kinda bland. Plus they didn't bring part of our order so it was like cool we don't want it anyway. It seems like the normal complete meal that you get from any other breakfast place you have to add it on here. Then the food took some time to come out. Smh. We were like it doesn't take that long to make breakfast. We were not impressed with this place at all. Sad to say but we won't be going back"}
{"text":"Truly an awful disappointment. Service flat out sucks. The 1st time my wife and I are here there was an insect in her food. Instead of yelling fire in a crowded theater I quietly notified the manager. His response? \"Our food is organic, local and sometimes this happens.\" WTF? NO! It means you're not washing your greens before cooking you dolt! DISGUSTING! Matt's breakfast is all hype and no substance. The only thing big about it is the check. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"What can be said which hasn't been all ready??!!  Great food, service and prices!  Endless coffee, fresh squeezed oj and excellently prepared meals.  Definitely worth a go!!!"}
{"text":"simply amazing. the wait is so worth it. i love everything i've had so far. i'm obsessed with the orange juice."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is great. The breakfast specials are amazing. You can't go wrong with the steak and eggs or the 3  egg scrambled. The fresh squeezed orange juice and blueberry honey lemonade make everything feel right in the world. One thing you have to be prepared for is the wait since its first come first serve, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"I always thought I would never write a review and post it. To me the option of others regarding an establishment is moot, we all have things we value over other things when to it comes an establishment. However the one thing EVERYONE can agree on is getting what we asked for in a timely manner. That brings me to this review about Matt's Big Breakfast.  I have wanted to try Matt's Big Breakfast for a while now. I know there is usually a decent wait to get a table, but I had a foodie friend in town from NYC and thought she is the perfect person to go with me. We got there on Monday after the Super Bowl at around 11am... as I thought we were on a wait, 30 minutes, not bad.  They called our names and we sat right by the door at the bar that looks outside to the street. Our server was fast to come to us and take our drink order. Our Strawberry Honey Lemonades arrived and she took our order and went to put them in. Now it doesn't really matter what we ordered but I will tell you anyway; The Hog and Chick, with a side pancake and the daily special (omelet of some sort) with a side pancake.  After about 10 minutes The Hog and Chick plate arrived, 3 minutes later both side pancakes arrived, 2 minutes later the bill arrived. When the server came back I told her our whole order had not come out. She said oh yeah you didn't get your toast, she leaves before I could say anything. She brings back a side of toast and I said the other dish, the daily special didn't come out yet. She goes back brings more toast and says she put in the daily special. 5 more minutes go by and the same server takes away my plates (yes I ate, I was starving) and she asked did we get the bill. I tell her yes, but we still are waiting for my friends order. 5 more minutes go by and I go to pay. I told the manager behind the counter about our missing meal, so it could be removed from the bill. The manager asked if I had told the server we didn't get our entire meal... yes I told her. The manager just seemed more concerned that she pointed out the error of the server, because she asked me this question 2 or 3 times. The manager then asks the kitchen, the kitchen didn't know anything about a daily special on that ticket or about having one told to them 5 minutes ago about it being done on the fly.   The manager removes the meal; just the daily special and I pay for the rest. The manager says they will get the daily special out for us right away. I tell her I am done, my friend doesn't want it and we are leaving so there is no point. The manager insisted that we wait and take it, okay I think she is trying to make it up to us... we will wait. So 5 more minutes go by and I see a bag up in the window, a few more minutes go by (as it sat in the window) and I tell my starving friend let's go. As we are getting up to leave a server runs over and says \"here is your to-go order\" TO GO ORDER! That is funny!! I ask for the manager and she said \"you already spoke to her.\"   I was not happy that the manager didn't deliver it herself and apologize to my friend, I was not happy that my friend now had a horrible experience and was still starving, I was not happy that the server said I had already spoken to the manager.  I am disappointed that a small restaurant in downtown Phx that was featured on a national TV Show didn't care enough about a local to come over and say anything, giving us the meal to go was pointless (it went in the trash)  Next time work on customer service, not pushing the bill on guests (there was no longer a wait) and make sure EVERYONE in the party has their meal. It's a little late to ever change my opinion, maybe my friends (yes I have told a lot of ppl about this experience) will still go and judge for themselves. If they do my advice I told them... don't go hungry, you may not get your food."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times.  Liked it a lot, the food was good, the service is warm and friendly and the wait was fun with friends.  I don't have anything against Matt - I love the Roosevelt and visit there fairly often - I just don't see the point in waiting, in the sun, for breakfast - when it's not that special and if you have to walk into the hotel next door to use the restroom.  I am looking forward to some competition."}
{"text":"Amazing French toast and they use all local companies for their bacon & sausage, yuuummm!"}
{"text":"They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  If you are looking for quality than look no further.    My coworkers and I been to this location many times.  And every time we came it was a great experience.  Every time we come here there is always a long wait.  But it's worth it, the quality and the ingredients are top notch!  The hams and the bacons.... amazing!!  The food here is definitely worth the wait.  The place is alway very cramped but it's okay, it's a small little place.  They also have another location, but I have not been to that one, I think it's at the airport.  Overall this is a great little place in the downtown area, I highly recommend this place.  You won't be sorry about the quality, there's a long wait here for a reason :) ohh yeah parking sucks, you might want to carpool!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place because of the breakfast! I ordered a waffle with bacon the waffle was phenomenal but the bacon was burnt. My boyfriend ordered the house potatoes and as much as it looked appetizing it tasted like I took a mouthful of RoseMary. The freshly squeezed orange juice was great! And we had great, friendly service!"}
{"text":"Reviews scared me a little but I can say my experience was very good... service was exceptional. I had the French toast and sausage...very good...and the orange juice is fresh squeezed...at least that's how it tasted...none of that funny added sugar many restaurants serve...for an airport extremely reasonably priced....had the sausage not been a little over cooked this would have been 5 star rating"}
{"text":"Was visiting Arizona and asked where would be a decent place to eat. When I first found this place it didn't appear to be a hot place. Appearances can be deceiving.   I have had some great food in my travels. But this was the best overall experience I had. I ordered a regular breakfast and had pancakes on the side and of course an RC cola.   The wait staff was attentive and very friendly. So friendly that I felt like a regular. The place was packed with customers but the wait staff worked as if it were not an issue. My food arrived hot and quick. It was absolutely delicious.   I would personally recommend matts big breakfast to anyone. I will be returning when I visit arizona in future."}
{"text":"Could not be better in any way!  Service was very fast and the food is amazing.  The bacon was very thick and fresh, potatoes were perfect and had some fresh rosemary in them. This is the best toast I have ever had, nice and thick with a nice homemade jam.  I hope I'm at the B gates on terminal 4 again soon to get a meal here! So good!"}
{"text":"This place definitely lived up to the hype! I have lived in Arizona for a month now and this was on my restaurant list because I'm a big fan of Triple D. Coincidentally I moved 2 blocks away from this place.   There was a 15 minuet wait but so what, it is worth it. I got the hog and chick because I had to try the bacon. It was GREAT! I like my eggs cooked runny and they got them perfect.   The staff was quick, efficient, and friendly. My coffee cup stayed full."}
{"text":"I wish I could write a review based on their food because it is pretty good but for me if the service isn't up to par I can't completely enjoy myself. I was really disappointed the last time we went in at the attitudes of the staff. They seemed almost cocky as if they were doing ME a favor allowing me to eat there. They wouldn't tell us an appx wait time, refused to split check saying we could do the math ourselves and just let them know, and several other rude responses to our questions. They really forget that there are tons of other good breakfast joints in the area and we don't need to go there. We are central Phoenix residents and for many of our friends and family the go-to for restaurant recommendations. After the last visit I am taking them off our list of breakfast to recommend. It's a real shame and I hope if we ever go back we will be met with friendliness and an appreciation for our business."}
{"text":"That's big breakfast holds the best bacon I've ever ate!! If you order anything from here make sure it has bacon!! I honestly don't know how they do it but I've never ate bacon like I do here. They always have daily specials that I do recommend to go with because their specials or pretty much their signatures. I highly recommend this place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Never before in my life have I tasted breakfast this good. The place is small (very small), expect to wait around an hour on the weekends.  Once you get in here try the \"Hog and Chick\", I suggest you get the hash browns over the potatoes, and you MUST MUST MUST try the bacon! (if you're a vegan - let it go for one day!)   Their waffles are to die for too.  Another 100 places like this and Downtown Phoenix will be THE place to live!!!"}
{"text":"My first visit to the new bigger location and I was shocked to still have to wait for 30 min on a Wednesday am. I think it was mostly spring training tourists. Anyway, I finally got a seat at the bar and once again enjoyed my favorite breakfast in the world. I can't explain how Matt makes a simple breakfast so remarkable - I'm just glad he does. BTW the new location is only 100 yards north of the old one. Try the bacon! the fresh OJ is to die for, and the hash browns are potato perfection."}
{"text":"Ok, so first for the bad:  So the first time I went there was when some friends invited me. They were already at the restaurant, I was still in bed at home in Avondale. I showered, dressed and drove over there...they were still waiting for a table. In fact once I got there we waited another 30 minutes for a table. that means my friends were waiting over an hour and a half for a table. My other complaint is that my potatoes are always too burnt, even when I tell them not to burn them. They are closed on Monday (you would have thought I would remember this the first two Monday;s I came to eat here) So now for the good: Everything else! I love the food! The Chop & Chick and griddle cakes are my fave for breakfast and for lunch I love...well just about everything! Can't wait till I move back so I can go again!!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot from the B-terminal.  Our family landed at 6 am with a 3 hour layover until our next flight.  The hot coffee is decent.  We got Matt's Big Breakfast x 2.  One order we subbed the griddle cake for toast.  The griddle cake is sweet and delicious (almost reminiscent of corn bread).  The toast was a large slice of multi-grain with a very tasty raspberry jam.  We also got sweet and savory which includes two french toast with a sausage.    The short: good place for breakfast indeed!"}
{"text":"The food here us pretty good and service is usually friendly. They are slowwwwww. Really not a good trait for an airport restaurant. Only eat here if you have at least 45 mins til boarding."}
{"text":"Yes it is very busy, yes Guy Fieri went there... but OVERRATED! The food is fine but with the rep this place has, it really should be a whole hell of a lot better. The coffee is great but everything else is something I could whip up in my own kitchen"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service!!!  I had the Sonrisa burrito.  I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had a great breakfast.  The waitress/bartender was very attentive and give us some great suggestions.  I wanted just a standard 2 eggs OM sausage patty, hash Browns and toast.  Simple and delicious!  They moved over a couple of buildings into a bigger space."}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast I've had at an airport! The seating was pretty tight but you can't expect much at an airport restaurant. I ordered the cheese omelet with potatoes and sourdough toast with the strawberry preserves. Everything was great quality and for a reasonable price when compared to other airport restaurant prices. Friendly wait staff as well. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Matt's, not just for breakfast! 10 of us gals, (yes 10) rolled into Matt's for one last drink (after draining Costco's wine section for 5 days straight) and a bite to eat before boarding our flight home. While this is one of the nicest Airport restaurants I've eaten in, and the food (when it finally arrived) was quite good, there were just way too many snafus for me to give them more then 3 stars.   To start, 3 of us got there before the others - thank you priority check-in! So we ordered a good 15 minutes before the rest of the group. Needless to say, after 45mins, watching the rest of the group get their meals, and finish, we still had not got our meals. Everyone shared, so I can tell you the Cobb salad, super good as are the fries. Now after trying to ask our waitress, a few times, to find out what happened to our meals, she kept saying the kitchen was busy and it will come when it comes... We all knew this was not right, no matter how busy a kitchen is, food ordered first, comes first if it is the same item. Well after 45 minutes of ignoring our concerns, finally she let us know that the food runner had brought our 3 meals to another table over half an hour ago. Right.... So now we need to board a flight, they quickly make us our meals, it comes out under cooked, we have a few bites before running to board, we get the bill and the 3 of us have our meals 10% compt. 10 freaking percent?!!! You have got to be kidding me Matt's! That is so unacceptable for a 45 minute wait, major screw up and then undercooked food that comes out and the 3 of us ate less then a quarter of. Not impressed."}
{"text":"We finally made it to Matt's! How many YEARS have we talked about going here? I don't remember, but I'm glad we did.   My partner and I picked out a weekday to venture out to Matt's since I'm not big on waiting for food. I'm hungry, get me a table, take my order and put the plate in front of me a few minutes later. Matt's did just that and more.   After a quick drive into Phoenix from our home in the vast wasteland of corporate chain restaurants that comprises Desert Ridge we made it to Matt's. YEAH!!, no wait we were seated right away. Our server came by quickly and took our beverage orders while giving us a few minutes to peruse the menu.  I ordered the special and he had the Chop and Eggs. We shared a side of sausage. TI hhe coffee was amazing as were both breakfasts. I'm not a fan of their Home Fries but you should try them anyway...it may just be me.  I haven't looked yet, but there are probably hundreds of reviews for Matt's. We were probably just the last ones to get there. Unless you go after us for the first time, then YOU'LL be the last ones to discover this amazing breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Oh. My. This place is phenomenal. Super good food!! The place is always packed, but totally worth the wait to get in. They use the best ingredients (like real butter), and everything we've had is heavenly. Fantastic scratch lemonades too!!"}
{"text":"Saw this on triple D. Gave it a shot on the way The science center. Fresh food. Fresh ingredients. Unique items on the menu. As well as the classics. It lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"When I think of a great breakfast place I would take my friends, I think of Matt's.  Hands down the best breakfast joint!  I understand that waiting for a seat can be long but it is worth the wait.    I know the new place has been open for awhile but I love it!  Bigger location but still the great food and friendly staff!  I am just drooling over the thought of the Belgium waffle with REAL maple syrup and BACON!  All of my favorite foods on one plate.  The Chicken Sandwich with pesto, provolone and peppers is the juiciest sandwich I have ever tasted.  The peppers are not on the usual sandwich. I believe it was the lunch special.  Matt's is a fixture in Phoenix and they are here to stay.    I wish I could give you more stars!!"}
{"text":"Place was packed on the Tuesday morning I visited. However, we found space at the bar to be serviced immediately. I ordered the salami scramble which came with your choice of toast and breakfast potatoes. Food came out timely and it was very good. Potatoes were my favorite. The jam they provided for the toast was delicious, too. Customer service was great."}
{"text":"You seriously cannot go wrong if you've wound up at this place.  Everything on the menu is simply fantastic.  When I finally ventured to have lunch here I got blown away by the grilled chicken sandwich.  Its really small though so you usually have to wait.  And its so small you usually have to wait outside.  Because its so small."}
{"text":"One of our favorites on our \"Breakfast Circuit.\" Small menu with the basics done extremely well. Good coffee. As with any place worth going, get there early, ESPECIALLY if you have a group."}
{"text":"Good but not worth the wait, we waited over 2 hours for a party of 3.  Very nice staff and place looks clean.  Nothing really stood out to justify that type of wait."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Their employees are so rude and make you feel like they almost don't want you there. Service was terrible but I don't mind dealing with people like that when I'm on the go. What just made me never want to come back was when I saw the host ask a guy that was sitting at a table to get up and move (mid meal mind you) to another place outside the restaurant because \"he had takeout\" it was from their same place!!!! And there were about 6 other open tables!!!! Are you kidding!!?!? Never coming back! I'd rather get a prepackaged crappy sandwich next time."}
{"text":"Got the special Classic Eggs Benedict.  I have never had eggs Benedict and I loved it. The only thing that threw me off is that it is a plate that could be eaten at lunch or dinner. I think I would enjoy more if it were for lunch or dinner.  This could simply be that I am inexperienced with eggs Benedict. The service was great and quick.  The vibe was great as well.  Well done everyone!"}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast is a great place to have well... breakfast. The new location is great, although I wish that they could have added a few more tables.  There is one thing that I hate...Lines. Seriously. I would rather have a reservation. But I hate lines. especially in 100 degrees.   Matt's would get a 5 star, except for the lines. It is a great place for breakfast, and I still highly recommend it. ( I always go for a special.... something new...something different).  Their honey lemonade is awesome :)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed it, the family wasn't impressed. I'm a bit of a breakfast snob so when the kids and wife pressure me to go to Denny's, I turn up my nose and refuse to be a party to such heathenism. I ordered the chop and chick. The eggs were undercooked (wife and I ordered over medium)I made due because the toast was no lie, 2\" thick, so I had plenty of real estate to mop up the runny whites and yolk. The pork chop was good, but I really enjoyed the home fries which much to my surprise were grilled up with fresh rosemary. Don't get the hash browns you will be disappointed. The family wasn't impressed by the thick cut locally farm raised bacon or the cage free eggs, or the fresh squeezed orange juice. Hell even the ketchup was non GMO. Oh well... On to the next, I refuse to give into the big breakfast corporate juggernauts."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The blueberry honey lemonade was to die for! The sourdough toast with blueberry preserves were out of this world! I can't wait to go back! The price was just right and the decor was adorable! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Beginning the day as I do most, with a morning run well before the sun is up, the first stop on this 6-stop tour would be downtown - a place I've now discovered to be devoid of most signs of human life on a Saturday...except for a small parcel of land at 801 North 1st Street entitled \"Matt's Big Breakfast\" where a line of thirty or so was already waiting for the approximately 20 seats inside.  Having heard of the nearly decade old establishment owned and operated by Matt Pool during my first visit to Phoenix but unable to make it downtown before ten on any day during that trip (when lines reportedly top two hours despite triple digit temperatures) I have to admit that I really had not anticipated the line to be so long at 6:55am and for a moment I contemplated heading elsewhere, but with my books in hand and nothing better to do my curiosity won out and I added my name to the paper list and took a seat in the rapidly dissipating shade.  Sitting and reading while a pair of ASU students talked about having seen Matt's on (presumably a repeat) of Diners, Dives, and Drive-Ins the previous night I tried to ignore them (and Guy Fiere's existence in general) while a few people trickled out of the restaurant and with my name at least ten parties down on the list I was surprised when it was called - the solo diner benefit, it seems, landing me an end seat on the counter only fifteen minutes after I arrived and given the expedient service at Matt's a fortuitous happening that had me leaving the restaurant before the aforementioned students had even entered the doors.  Seated at the counter with a menu I'd already memorized in hand and a daily special that held little interest I perused the interior - small, stark, but efficient and exceptionally clean - before my server filled my water glass, offered me coffee, and fielded a pair of questions prior to taking my order and handing it over to the kitchen less than five feet away.  With the space tight and my location literally on the verge of the kitchen and the pass it would not be long before my coffee was filled - a single pour that I subsequently sent back due to a combination of thin mouth-feel, acrid flavor, and no artificial sweetener - and even less time before my stool would be bumped into for the first of thirty times...to say the least this is not a place I'd choose to linger.  Seated and watching the action of the kitchen as plate after plate came through the window and regular after regular chatted with Matt's wife at the cash register it would not be long before my order would arrive and with the restaurant's strong dedication to local/organic/fresh sourcing the items that were presented quickly made me realize why so many people deal with long waits and less-than-comfortable seating to experience Matt's Big Breakfast - the food is really quite excellent, beginning first with a perfect hotcake served with pure maple syrup and far too much (or perhaps just the right amount of) butter for $2.75.  Moving from the dainty golden flapjack to something more substantial, my second dish would actually consist of two plates and four items in the form of \"The Chop & Chick\" - an $8.95 breakfast comprised of a Pan Seared Iowa Pork Rib Chop with 2 Poached Eggs, Hash Browns, and Whole grain Toast with Blueberry Rhubarb Jam.  Apparently their most 'famous' dish it is a little difficult to decide which aspect of the plate was the best considering the quality of perfectly poached eggs (something even good restaurants tend to overcook,) crisp yet buttery potatoes and lightly herbed juicy pork chop but in the end I think I would have to give the nod to the toast - hand cut thick, rife with seeds and a rich earthiness, and topped with house made preserves featuring what seemed to be no sugar at all but rather the essence of blueberries with a slight savoriness from the rhubarb...a strong contender for best jam/preserves I've ever encountered and reason enough to revisit Matt's when it moves to its new digs a few doors down (and hopefully decreases wait times and seat bumps...and perhaps finds a coffee roaster whose beans better compliment the quality of the food.)"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast while vacationing in Phoenix, heard some great things mainly about the freshness of food and how delicious it is. I orders the cheese omelette with hash browns and my husband ordered the Five Spot sandwich. Everything we ate was so delicious! Some lad we came here, seems like a great local gem from all the regulars that were there. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Let's just say thank you yelper for getting me pretty solid reviews on this place so we don't spent a lot of time figuring out some of the must haves.  This is consider one of the decent breakfast I had in awhile.  Coming from LA area we had tons of authentic breakfast here and there, but we focus so much on specialties and yet we forget the traditional american style breakfast is liked.  Let's get to it!   Food=  4/5 nothing special made but the portion and the quality is decent to pass expectation.  The sausage is kind of overrated in my opinion, but the sandwish is a must have for first timers.  Service= 5/5 the food came so fast we don't even have the time to prepare ourselves after setting up our kids in their high-chair which is pretty solid.  When it gets busy you tends to lose their attention but when you ask any of the passing by servers, they will get to it ASAP.  The managers and the owner of the business were very friendly with greets. Wait time= 4/5 the wait can be long but we were able to get right through due to early arrival @ 6:45AM.  The parkings fill up in the back pretty quick. Location= 5/5 the location is right by the freeway so it's pretty hard to ignore/miss in my opinion.   I would give a solid 4.5 but in this case I will give them a 5 since the experience was very pleasant; this is what a good restaurant should be like."}
{"text":"This place is amazing....the food is delicious and quick...worth the wait all though they said about 1/2 an hour we got seated in 20 mins...the staff is super friendly even though it's really slammed....I got the five spot best egg sandwich I have had in a long time...the organic apple juice is great as well as the strawberry honey lemonade....come down to matts big breakfast :)"}
{"text":"1st time trying this place...hopes were very high sadly our experience wasn't great.   3 stars   -Service was alright  -food we ordered (the chop & chick) was dry -the coffee wasn't good as well tasted very bitter...we paid for our meal wish it was better."}
{"text":"Yum-o! After seeing Matt's on triple D I knew that we would have to hit it up on our trip to Phoenix, and it did not disappoint. We arrived at about 10:30 on a Friday morning and waited for about 10 minutes before getting seated at the bar. I started with the OJ, my husband got the strawberry honey lemonade, both were amazing! For breakfast I did the omelette with cheddar cheese and bacon, husband got the eggs and sausage patties. There is an up charge for the bacon in my omelette but it was totally worth it, there was tons of delicious bacon in my omelette. The highlight if the meal was he amazing sourdough toast and jam. If I hadn't been so full of bacon I would have gotten an extra side of toast - so good!  I wish we lived in Phoenix so we could go back!"}
{"text":"My final meal in Phoenix, which was breakfast. This small brick place has made me famous with the name (of course) and was honored with a \"Review of the day\", which seems like a distant-memory ago. My first visit and first meal back then was a monumental one. Will my return to \"my\" breakfast place be a repeat?   Some things hasn't changed much about my place. There was a little wait for a table, especially on a early weekday morning. \"My place...why should I have to wait for a table?\"  This time, my return back has got me ordering one of the breakfast specials, which was the Salami Scramble. For $5.95 and affordable meal too, I get three scrambled eggs mixed with Soppresata Salami with a side of Hash Browns and a pair of thick toasted Sourdough Bread with Strawberry Preserves. The crispiness of the sliced salami blended with the scramble eggs made it a tasty combination. The hash browns were tasty and a nice compliment to my meal. And the thick-ass toasted Sourbread bread with melted butter and the preserves was crunchy with a powerful explosion that can be heard all over the small diner (in a good way).  My place hasn't failed in my return. I'm always welcome to come back and dine at my breakfast place whenever I come back to Phoenix. And so, you can too."}
{"text":"Amazing! Honey lemonade so yummy, coffee on point, five spot- delicious, hog and chick -nom nom! :) Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food deserves a 5* rating. Always fresh and delish.  But the service could use a lot of help. First off they gave us silverware that had old food stuck to it. They didn't refill our drinks, had to ask the manager after waiting forever. They gave us the check as we were finishing our food, which was fine But we went to the restroom and came back, They had already dumped everything at our table and seated someone else in the 3 mins we spent in the bathroom. Our check \"was\" on the table. We paid still.  But we were NOT done. I found this very rude. If  it happens again.  I'm not paying. The one downtown is much more respectful."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING! It was featured on the food network. I met a friend here and was genuinely surprised on how good this place was. They pride themselves on fresh ingredients and they deliver. Its a bit eclectic and the area is interesting. Yet, even so I would say its a must go!"}
{"text":"The food is OK. It's the hype on television that make it a big deal. Snooze is the best breakfast place EVER! Go there instead:)"}
{"text":"What a fantastic spot to grab a meal. I got the Bloody Mary and meatloaf. Every ingredient in the Bloody Mary was perfect. Extra crispy celery. Briny olives. Crispy thick bacon. YUM. Meatloaf was excellent."}
{"text":"Two visits a row = very disappointing  Twice now the eggs over medium are runny - I guess when you ask for the whites to be cooked through it doesn't matter; toast not toasted?? What's up Matt??  I don't want you to \"take care of my breakfast\" I simply want to enjoy a good breakfast before my flight, and I'm happy to take care of the bill."}
{"text":"Waited 40 mins for our table. I was expecting the food to be better for that long of a wait. Took them almost 10 minutes to bring me water. The food was just ok. Also, I asked for a side of syrup, and it was a $1.50 extra for a small amount. I don't mind the extra charge, but 1.50 for like 2 oz? If anything it should be an extra 50 cents. OR there shouldn't even be any charges cause it is a breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Matt's was my favorite breakfast place ever but now I have to add a caveat.  Do not go to Matt's during a busy if you want to hear anything the waitress or anyone that is with you.  The food is still fabulous and it is great that you do not need to wait long but the noise level is a constant roar of voices.  Even if I was alone it is uncomfortably noisy.  I would not go there again for breakfast until at least after 9 AM .  Maybe it gets busy again for the lunch crowd but I have never been there  after 10:30AM"}
{"text":"My bestie and I stopped in today. I don't know how I didn't know about this place sooner! It's a little hidden in the Safeway shopping center. We came in around noon and it was pretty packed, luckily they had one last booth available for 2. We got seated fast, shortly got our order taken and our food came in no time!   We both ordered the Hog & Chick (eggs, potatoes, bacon and toast). It was great!! Especially the bacon! Super thick cut and they gave 3 slices which is awesome. Oh yes, and the toast with jam was a pleasant surprise too! They gave fresh jelly that had pretty much whole blueberries in it! Soooo good. The whole plate was -BIG- and for under $10 for those quality ingredients, it was totally worth it! I'll definitely be back to try other signature dishes.   Also, the service was great, we were checked up on by multiple people who were all so nice. The ambience had a typical diner feel, but more modern.  Five stars easily!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. I got The Hog & Chick and it was amazing. Scrambled eggs, amazing thick cut bacon seasoned to perfection, delicious big sourdough toast, and hashbrowns I could eat for the rest of my life. Everything's made in house or sourced locally and it tastes like it--super fresh and satisfying. Even the iced coffee is ground daily and was lovely. Couldn't have asked for a better meal. Also the decor and entire old school hipster branding fits perfectly--very appealing."}
{"text":"Long wait but always worth it. The bacon is amazing here, so don't try Matt's without enjoying it! Coffee is also great here. I appreciate the small menu as I know they are good at what they do. Not too fancy, but good ol' fashion good breakfast. Come early as the line gets a little crazy."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for work, staying downtown. Matt's was exactly what I was looking for as an alternative to the hotel restaurant or Starbucks. Cool atmosphere, great service, and good food. I had the Huevos Rancheros special on a Monday morning. Didn't finish it all (big plate!) but it was a delicious start to the day. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Until I read the rant reviews about Matt's I never knew there could be so many people with cold coffee running through their veins.  Wow.  Summing it down, it seems the #1 complaint is at Matt's (unlike Denny's) they have to wait in the hot Phoenix sun to get in or that the place is \"small\".  DUH!  If you go to a place that serves better-than-average food, and it is a small old historic place it's not going to be the same as squeezing your tubby stomach into a booth at Denny's and ordering an \"out of your mind\" $1.99 breakfast to make your butt even bigger.  In other words, if you like Denny's so much why did you go to Matt's?  Make your choice ... pre-processed food from a mega-chain, or fresh food from local guy who works hard to serve locally grown/bought products and has gotten extremely popular because of it.  Small?  Are you kidding?  That's GOOD, not negative, how can you possibly rate a place bad because it is small?  Hate the Food Network?  Geez ... then don't go to a place that has been so highly rated.  Why subject your tender spoiled body to waiting in that \"miserable\" Phoenix sun?  People waiting in line means they know where to find great food.  BTW, my first few visits to Matt's were BEFORE Triple-D and it was and remains a place to go for people who have good taste.  And the complaint about having to go to the bathroom in the kitchen is pure BS - the clean bathroom is in the motel next door, not the kitchen.  We only have one Matt's in Phoenix and thank you heavens.  Is the food good?  Yes?  Is it fresh and uses the best local products?  Yes?  Is the service friendly and local?  Yes (if you're a tourist or Snow-Bird you just won't get this concept anyway).  Somebody believes the OJ is $2.50 for 2 ounces?  Really?  REALLY??    Here are a few personal observations:  I don't eat potatoes much, but I almost always finish Matt's home fries.  I am not a big bread eater, but I love Matt's fresh home-made bread.  Their eggs are local and bought by Matt every morning (he doesn't own a refrigerator or microwave at his restaurant).  The bacon on NOT what you will find at Denny's (a place you can walk right in to without having to spend 30 minutes of your precious self-consumed life standing in that horrid Phoenix sun). No, NO, I'm serious, there are actually tourists who reviewed Matt's and compared them negatively to DENNY'S!!!!!!!!!  Where Matt's really shines is not so much their excellent breakfasts, but the fact that they probably make one of the best Reuben Sandwiches in America.  Yes, better than Manhattan, better than that place where you chomp into a lot of fat and bread and pay twice as much for the privilege.  Not only is the sandwich great but the side of homemade macaroni salad is big enough to serve the entire restaurant.  Want to avoid the 30 minute wait for breakfast?  Go to Matt's for lunch when the place is much less busy and get to know the people who work there and why their food is several cuts above most of what you will find in Phoenix."}
{"text":"It finally happened! After an eternity we finally got to visit Matt's on a day (Veteran's Day to be exact) when the line was only about 10 minutes long. We've been hesitant about the new location after years of eating at the original location, would the new location totally suck, would the food be different, would it be \"downtown cold and impersonal\"? We had this fear that Matt's had hit the big time and that old comfy place was gone forever.  Well, not so. The area when you first walk in has an uncanny feeling that you are in the old Matt's. The same is true with that weird little closed off room in the front; it had a lot of memories of that weird little closed off room to the left when you walked into the old Matt's. The big dining room has the biggest changes, and guess what? I didn't dislike it. It had that loud high-school cafeteria feeling to it still, tables packing in tight, funky but not pretentious (hard to do). The overworked staff was just as much \"family\" as in the old Matt's. The menu looked identical, the prices looked about the same, the portions were ... okay, not so \"big\" as I recall. Big yes compared to Denny's for about the same price (eeech, like someone would actually choose Denny's) but to my memory not quite so overwhelming as it used to be.  Bottom line: the \"new\" Matt's is still Matt's to me. I'm flexible and I can adapt.  My rating is still zero stars, hated it, horrible food and service, cockroaches in the food, a place even a homeless person wouldn't eat for free ... that \"rating\" is for the newbies. Please stay away until us locals have had our leisurely meal at Matt's, then make your reservation for, um let's say, about 2 AM on a Tuesday and get your butt out of there in 5 minutes or less to leave some tables for us \"Matt-afficionados\".  Biggest NEGATIVE? They deleted all of the old reviews just because they moved to the other end of the same block. BOO!  That to me is just kind of chickenshit. If you want to be so pretentious, change your frigging name. Otherwise just man up to the fact that a review for Matt's Big Breakfast should be a review forever. You lost a whole star for that crap, Matt."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, and the coffee is great! My go-to dish is usually the waffles or pancakes.  The food is really flavorful, the portions are huge. I've never been disappointed :)"}
{"text":"More like \"Matt's little breakfast selections\"  No vegetarian options and they don't even have avocado"}
{"text":"Amazing food - subpar music selection. If they could stray away from using 2005's top 40 hits that would really elevate things. I will say that they had excellent service - in the words of the supposed manager guy. Chloe was an incredible server and I hope she gets promoted."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. Overly priced items. They do not allow substitutions. Ordered breakfast and would not give me Sausage and bacon. Even though they charge $1 per bacon strip, i couldnt get it. This is just poor service. Regardless if the owner doesnt allow. This is rediculous. Their shared service is confusing. Did not know how to ask for refills or when they did not deliver all our food. I ordered scrambled eggs, and they were not real eggs. Orange juice was mediocre. Had better experiences with breakfast else where. I came here because i saw it on the food channel. Will not be returning due to the experience."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast has high quality, simple food done right. Their griddlecakes are tender with a good rise (although, a tad too sweet for my preference). I also had the \"Hog & Chick\" with bacon and over easy eggs. The eggs were tasty and the bacon was perfectly done, but the star of the show for me was the hashbrowns. They are simultaneously creamy and soft, with a fabulous crust on the exterior.   Service is so efficient and friendly. For example, our table was a little wobbly, so we brought it to someone's attention. And, the guy had a wedge in his pocket so he was able to fix it right then!  The wait can be long, but the neighborhood is cute so you can walk around to kill time. I visited in winter and didn't have to wait out in the hot sun. If that had been my experience maybe I would feel differently about how the wait affects the overall rating."}
{"text":"Stopped in 1st time and was very impressed. Seats were open at the bar and we ordered the omlet and BLT. Both came with side of hash browns which were amazing! My omlet was huge and I wish I had ordered cheddar but ordered provalone instead. I could only finish half due to the amount of food. The sourdough toast was awesome as well with the fresh made jam/jelly. Service was great. Highly recommended. They have lunch items as well."}
{"text":"Was very busy but service was good.   Got pancakes and bacon.   It was good.  They are a bit pricey."}
{"text":"This has to be the best breakfast I've ever had!  I ordered the special which was scrambled eggs with sweet peppers, whiskey fennel sausage and Havarti cheese.  It was outstanding!  We had to wait for over an hour which we knew that going in.  The food was definitely worth the wait.  Looking forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"Dear Matt (assuming that Matt exists),  This is not about the food - it was excellent.  This is not about cleanliness - it was spotless.  This IS ABOUT ... Alexa, our server.  She was beyond excellent.  Clone her.  Really.  We arrived on the red eye from Kona.  Good olde American Airlines decided to skip feeding us in First Class, saying that the 5 hour flight allowed insufficient time to serve 12 people the \"Full Breakfast\" that was listed on our itinerary - I kid you not.  Just shut up and each your potato chips.  Coffee?  Cold.  Decaf?  Instant.  First Class, my arse.  We arrived early, hungry and cranky.  There was a bit of line.  The restaurant seemed packed, yet we were seated immediately.  How'd you DO that?  (By paying attention and sweating the details).  Waters arrived immediately.  Lemon?  Let me get that!  Coffee followed promptly.  Hot coffee, thank you.  We never saw the bottom of our coffee cups.  The breakfast sandwich and breakfast burrito were both excellent.  The portions were generous. Hot food, hot.  Cold food, cold.  The Bloody Mary's ... rock.  And ... Alexa also pointed out a virtually hidden AC outlet so that I could (re)charge my phone.  She's an important asset to your success.  Treasure her.  Nurture her.  Reward her.  (No, we are not family.)"}
{"text":"Cute spot. Great location. I never understood how a place can mess up traditional breakfast plates so 5 stars bc I love breakfast pretty much anywhere and anytime!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! It was a bit crowded but our party of two was seated pretty quickly. I'll definitely be back again as the menu seemed to have a lot of good things to try.  The orange juice was fresh and the coffee was hot and flowing! The atmosphere was busy and not good for a private conversation but who really has those over breakfast?!?"}
{"text":"Ok. Not great, barely good. Just ok.  Maybe I just expected too much, I don't know, but the potatoes were bad, the omelette was average and the service was adequate (I asked twice for water which I never got.) Oh. And I didn't even finish the slice of bacon - which borders on sacrilege.   With the big lines, I thought they did a good job of cleaning tables and readying them for the next group but that's not a big reason to endorse a restaurant, huh?"}
{"text":"down-home Southern-style - a cut above for airport food  I had the reuben sandwich with a side of macaroni, with the freshly-squeezed lemonade with honey. The marble rye bread on the sandwich had crust embedded with what tasted like caraway seeds, and was lightly toasted, and fresh-tasting. The pastrami is made in-house, the sign says. The meat was so-so with more fat than I expect, and the sauerkraut lacked flavor. The macaroni salad was really flavorful and I savored each bite. Now the standout for this meal was the lemonade!! I could suck down a gallon and still want more. Ironically, I was trying to avoid excess sugar, and though the sign claims that there's no added sugar, they do add a LOT of honey, which does contain tons of natural sugar, though sugar is sugar, and as addictive as cocaine and heroin, I keep reading in my holistic health blogs. That comes as no surprise.   I'd love to write more, but I am way behind on everything. Anyway, what a buzzkill I can \"bee\". Get the lemonade here, and enjoy life! Airports are really hard to be in, with all the waiting and the loud jarring noises, abominable behaviors right and left, and being WAAAAYYYYY to close for comfort to everyone in all those hellhole godawful tightly crowded stinky nasty airplanes (I don't fly first class - I'm so middle-class I can't bear to part with extra money for a few hours of a little more leg room and I don't need free cheap headache booze and used dirty blankets), so soothe yourself by eating what makes you happy, then exercise like crazy later.  What's not clear at all is that if you order at the counter, you take your food to go and you are supposed to eat it elsewhere, like at your gate, not in the restaurant, I later found out. Well, I committed a faux pas, unknowingly, and sat in the restaurant at a table right behind the counter where I placed my order. I apologized to the waiter who came by, and I asked if I should move, but he was gracious, and let me stay.   The other menu items, like the cheeseburger, looked really tempting.   People were enjoying themselves with beers, watching the futbol/soccer highlights reel at the bar."}
{"text":"The potatoes here are amazingly delicious!  I had a cheese omelette, bacon and the sourdough toast is thick and yummy.  The strawberry Jam is perfect  There are so many good things here it is well worth the wait  it's noisy and it's crowded and the food is wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Huevos rancheros verde is the most unique and special breakfast I ever had !"}
{"text":"Stunning, stunning, stunning food. The whole town was here on Christmas Eve and it's our new favorite breakfast stopover while in Phoenix.  Try the eggs Benedict special, and do yourself a favor and try their amazing coffee! They'll even pour a fresh cup to go for you, which is excellent if you're about to begin a long drive like we were."}
{"text":"So we ordered a simple omelet breakfast with hash browns well done. The first time it came out with breakfast potatoes not hash browns so instead of leaving the omelet they took the whole plate back and gave us hashbrowns (not well done) and the same omelet (now Luke warm). We send it back again after I had to get up and find a server becUse it was impossible to signal one even though we were waiting for ten minutes not touching our plate. I get a server someone comes over and says they'll fix it. We get toast (\"on the house\") in the meantime (we had already eaten our 2 orders of toast at this point ). We get our order again with a Luke warm omelet and breakfast potatoes (not hashbrowns). This time they leave the plate and say they'll bring us a side order of the hashbrowns well done. We get Luke warm hash browns not well done. They ask us if it's better and since it's already 1030 and were hungry we just say yes. They only comped the plate not our oj or toast and still charge us 6 bucks. Oh the best part our waitress stopped by once...and wasn't even aware we had sent our food back a second time. We are not picky people but have both been on the restaurant business and know how food should be cooked and customer service should be provided and this is not it."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! Small spot with big flavorful food. I got the Five Spot breakfast sandwich, amazingly soft bread!! You can taste how fresh all the ingredients are! First time here loved that we walked in and thru a large window you could see staff hand jarring jam! This place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I must say everyone here is super friendly!! Their customer service is really great! I had a scrambled egg, bacon, cheese sandwich with hash browns and it was all so tasty. A lot better than most breakfast places!! It was crowded, and I can definitely see why!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot to get a great breakfast. There's usually a good wait included here. The food is great. The pancakes are big, the eggs are on point, as are the hash browns. The sausage and bacon is good too. I love their honey lemonades. I will try and make this my breakfast spot every time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is worthy of their reputation. Great food and fast service.  Loved the pork chop and eggs."}
{"text":"The thick cut bacon is the THING TO GET. It's very crowded, so make sure you have a little extra time just in case. They have different specials every day of the week, so check before you go! The home fries are also delicious, with good spices.  The restaurant is loud, busy, and very casual."}
{"text":"Saw this establishment on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives. Guy Fieri was raving about his termed out of bounds breakfast choices. Matt appeared very courteous. Not as good as they say. They are all right. The reason is there's always a line is because this place is so darn tiny. Didn't have a restroom available... What's up with that? Will admit the service was efficient."}
{"text":"Chop and Chick breakfast was just ok. Pork chop was paper thin and way over cooked - tough and dry.   Eggs, hash brown, toast was good."}
{"text":"Matt's was absolutely fantastic. Got there at 2pm on a Sunday, which is apparently the time to do it (half an hour before close), as we walked right in, sat right down, and had food in 5 minutes or less. Brilliant.  I had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had. Two eggs, two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon, american cheese (my favorite with eggs when I'm not going fancy-style, reminds me of when I was a kid), and well grilled onions round it out, served on a fantastic roll.   By default, this item doesn't include the normal potatoes and toast, so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent, and entirely unnecessary. A huge portion of them, with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up, they were delicious, but I couldn't finish them.  The girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal. Matt's brings the good stuff, and it's MUCH appreciated. Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike. The waffle was fluffy, light, and had that good, homemade flavor.  I can't get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was. Service was prompt and friendly, and overall, it was a great experience. Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about $21. Absolutely worth every penny. Will be coming back. Probably near 2 o'clock again, to avoid the wait!"}
{"text":"Matt's has become what some may say is an addiction of mine. I prefer \"hobby\". But Matt's did make it into our wedding vows. (True story.) You see, since I first tasted the glory of the Five Spot, I've basically made it a point to get one on every available weekend day. So my wife thought it wise to pledge support publicly in front of friends and family for my perhaps less-than-healthy \"hobby\".  The wife works a lot of weekends, and I've found out that the Five Spot can travel the 10 minutes or so to my home largely intact. A perfectly balanced combination of spot-on eggs, melted cheese, grilled onions, and THE best bacon possible makes this the absolute best egg sandwich I've ever had.   Every ingredient is so delightfully high quality that the sandwich shines, bursting forth with flavor and cholesterol and existential angst. (Or, as some might call it, \"maple syrup that I dip it in\".)   Make sure you order a side of home fries. They're specifically not included with the sandwich which is \"how they get ya\", but I can't go without. Crisp, delicious potatoes served with a few sprigs of rosemary and... also dipped in syrup.   I had over 140 check-ins to Matt's before they moved and Yelp created a new profile for them. Every single one of them? A Five Spot with Home Fries. I'm pretty sure if you ordered a \"Chris\", that's what you'd get at this point.   Their waffles are amazing too, along with basically everything else on the menu. Absolutely perfectly fluffy, flavorful, and delicious, from what I've stolen off the wife's plate. And Erenia and the rest of the staff are as kind and amazing as can be.  The wait is rough, there's no doubt about that. But whereas most breakfast places slog along with watery eggs, sub-par, see-through bacon, horrible, waxy cheese, and no twists or turns, Matt's gets it perfectly right every time. Or at least all 140 times and counting."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast did not disappoint! Arrived before open .  Tried 3 other times the wait was too long. The Hog with the $1 ham was salty and delicious their potatoes have onions and rosemary yummy The chop was cooked crispy and was not dry Eggs over easy The sour dough toast with amazing fresh strawberry jelly I could eat all day long. Good coffee that was filled often  and even gave us  to go cups. We will be back"}
{"text":"This was an AWESOME surprise!  Enjoyed Breakfast with friends today, I ordered waffle w/ bacon. OMG !!! The Bacon!! Yes the waffle was great ;)  BUT THE BACON!!!   WELL you go and try it. Please let me know what you think !!!    Go see Daniel he's gonna make your day !"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast spot, give this place a try.  Despite being packed, we were still seated within a decent amount of time (10 min tops)."}
{"text":"I tried this after referring a friend from out of town. Great choice and great food. A little crowded and noisy but the food was hot and great! I will return!"}
{"text":"Came after seeing this place on the tv in England! Was really amazing such a great breakfast! Defo worth a visit! Don't reckon they need this review from how busy it was go early to avoid having a prolonged wait or missing service.hours!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to come here after reading the reviews, but after going, I don't know what all the hype is about.   The ambiance is quaint. Small house filled w lots of small tables. Service is quick and nice. I ordered the waffle which came with 2 thick slices of bacon for about $8. The waffle was yummy. The bacon was thick but way too peppery for my taste.   In my opinion, this is a good breakfast place in the heart of downtown. But nothing crazy special. There's a very small parking right behind the restaurant but it was full when I went on a Thursday morning, so I had to find street/meter parking.   Environment: 5/5 Food: 3/5 Price: 3/5 Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"The food is very good but the wait is long at certain times of the day. Still worth it."}
{"text":"Always a wonderful experience here. Fantastic staff, big portions, reasonable prices and delicious food. The new location is great - you still have to wait, but there is a lot more room inside and nice that there are more parking options outside."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Matt'a Big Breakfast! I started by eating at his original location in downtown Phoenix, and have since eaten at  both the airport location and the 32nd St. and Camelback location (the one I frequent the most). I usually get The Skinny, which is an egg white scramble with sausage and gruyere cheese. It also comes with a spinach salad with a very light dressing. I usually ask them to go light on the cheese. The best part about the meal is that they use Schreiner's sausage mixed into the scramble. Schreiner is a local company that has been around for years at seventh Street and Osborne. 5/5.   My guest had the Salami Scramble. Again, the eggs are organic and locally sourced. In addition, the salami is procured from Schreiner's sausage. It came with a generous portion of hashbrowns, and whole wheat toast with homemade jam. 5/5.  The ambience is fantastic because the walls contain a painting of old school Phoenix. Included in the mural is the Graham's Fruit Stand at 36th Street and Camelback, which I used to frequent as a kid. It is since been leveled and replaced with townhomes (bummer). It brings back great memories and makes me proud to be a native. Next time you are yelping and looking for a place to eat breakfast, look no more and definitely stop here for a visit!"}
{"text":"Bored with the hotel breakfast options we ventured out from our downtown hotel after finding Matt's on Yelp and seeing that it had been on triple D.  It was early Sunday and the place was already slammed. We ended up sitting at the bar, which had a cool concrete top and a kitchen window, allowing us to peak in and see the cooks and kitchen staff.  My wife ordered 2 eggs scrambled, hash browns, bacon and toast. I ordered an omelet with sausage and cheddar, got an RC Cola in a can for good measure.  Everything was great. My wife said; \"this is the best thing that has happened in Phoenix so far--I could eat here every day.\" I guess she liked it.  I was impressed by the cooks, managing all the orders, the quick service and the flavors.    Get to Matt's Big Breakfast and start the day off right, your stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"way overrated! bathroom in the kitchen, gross!  know what you're eating!  how much was the oj again?"}
{"text":"This place was unreal! Great food, great service, great overall experience. Looking forward to coming back on my next visit. Recommend the hashbrowns! My exact text to my wife was they were insane!"}
{"text":"Reviews were correct - this place serves amazing food.  Fresh OJ, omelet, and home fries were spot in.  They turned tables over quickly, so even with about 15 people before us, we waited less than 10 minutes to be seated.  Prepare to be stuffed in the most delicious way possible!"}
{"text":"This is one of those hole in the wall restaurants you hear good stuff about and is actually true!  When I first arrived I was a bit apprehensive having to write you name with pencil down on a piece of paper that the hostess only checked every so often. After about a 30 min wait (Saturday morning) we got a table. It is a very small place but cozy and bright as could be.  From the coffee to the breakfast sandwich, everything was great. As long as you aren't counting calories I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Obviously I've been here for breakfast.  I got the steak and eggs and I was amazed.  This amazement isn't from the steak or the eggs, even though they were both delicious, but it was with the toast.  I have never had such great toast before, and the jam was so fresh....  The wait was long, and we were there in July.  Limited shade outside, but at least they had a water jug for the people waiting.  I recommend preparing for the heat if you decide to go during the summer."}
{"text":"If I lived in Phoenix I'd be a regular here. They've apparently been on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and I can see why. The waffle was perfect and the bacon was perfect as well with a peppery flavor you don't get at most places. My coffee was constantly refilled almost faster than I could drink it and service was VERY friendly. Yelp is right on this place, check it out for sure."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix over the weekend and grabbed breakfast here on Monday morning.  I ordered \"The Chop & Chick\" with bacon and had my eggs scrambled.  Food was great and the service was even better.  Will definitely grab another meal here next time I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This is the best Yelp suggestion yet.  Matts Big Breakfast is amazing.  The prices are great, the food is wonderful and the people are absolutely incredible.  Gonna miss this place the most when we head back home to Colorado."}
{"text":"There is no \"big breakfast\". Matt told me himself. What you will get is a delicious, fresh, locally grown breakfast served by really nice people. Line was super long and I thought servings were average so I gave it three stars. Really nice place and I definately recommend it."}
{"text":"One of the most popular breakfast places in the Valley, and it lived up to its billing! Had the special, which was a 3-egg scramble with chipotle ranch sausage and cheese. Side of home fries, delicious, thick wheat toast served with some amazing raspberry jelly, and (based on all of the reviews) I got a side of the bacon.   I don't know where to start. The scramble was great, the sausage with jalapeños were awesome, the home fries were a great complement and the bacon. The bacon was legen-wait for it-DARY!!!  Can't wait to go back, sit at the bar and hang out with Bre H, who gave us some great tips on what to order and kept a smile on our faces!  Last tip: make a reservation if you can, as the line is apparently always long, even for the counter."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm sorry people of Phoenix, but I will go here every time I am in town. I saw it on the triple D and had to try it. We waited for about 20 minutes on a (late) Tuesday morning. I ordered the Butter Burger with Maytag blue cheese and my man ordered the waffle...neither disappointed. The service was fast and friendly. Loved it! Oh yeah, the place is TINY, but who cares when the food is this good?"}
{"text":"Monday special: Huevos Rancheros Verdes are a must!! The home fries were tasty!Great option for a quick and healthy bite before heading to the airport. Friendly, quick service. Coffee is delish."}
{"text":"Dang this place was good! Before traveling, my SO and I stopped here to eat since we had time and I was not disappointed. The hostess was a bit dry, bored, and wrung out but the rest of the staff was very welcoming and friendly so I won't let her influence my opinion. This place seems like the spot that would be packed all of the time, so expect to be rubbing elbows with a stranger while you eat. Aside from this, the food was great! I got their grilled cheese and french fries which were fantastic, they use a really thick bread which made the sandwich even better. I would definitely come here again...if I'm ever delayed and forced to fly Southwest again -_____-"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype was about. My server was friendly and cheerful. The dining area was clean, but it was also 7 am so it shouldn't be too dirty. As far as food, eh.   I've been wanting to try the location in downtown but there's always a long wait. So when I saw Matts Big Breakfast at the airport, I had to try it. I definitely will not go to the downtown location now. It's not worth waiting in line or going out of my way. It's great for anyone who wants lots of food for a reasonable price, especially at the airport. But taste wise, you're better off going to Dennys. Meaning, don't come here looking for good tasting food. There are plenty of great local restaurants in terminal 4.   I'm giving this place 3 starts because the service was good, location is good, and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Amazing! The best waffles I ever eaten, actually everything we ordered was very good. Great quality!"}
{"text":"I had the Sunday morning breakfast scramble special. Absolutely delicious! Great flavors. Service was awesome too."}
{"text":"Consistently fresh and good. Prices have gone up a little over the years, but the quality has remained high... still recommended - here and the one on Camelback near 32nd Street."}
{"text":"Huge line outside Saturday morning. We put name on list but only waited 10 minutes. We sat at the bar, really nice servers. Excellent breakfast here and ours was served really quickly.  Hot toast! Fresh squeezed Oj!"}
{"text":"Love the meatloaf and Elizabeth is the best. I comeback every week and she makes me feel like part of the family."}
{"text":"It was a nice surprise to know Matt's Big Breakfast opened a new location a little closer to home. The new location is beautiful and has a nice wide open view of the kitchen. We sat at the bar area and had great interactions with the staff. Of course, the food was amazing and was fairly inexpensive. I highly recommend the Sunday Steak & Eggs special if you get the chance."}
{"text":"The premier close to downtown/ASU breakfast spot in Phoenix. They have one in the B finger of terminal 4 at the airport too, and while good, it's just not the same. Excellent wait staff, yummy food (waffles are great, with just enough flour to hold the butter to-gether!!! and the chilli is a lunch time must have!). Remember they are two blocks north of their old location! Look for the orange umbrellas..."}
{"text":"Wake up in the morning, food was on my  mind. Whats a good place to eat? \"Heard the food portion at Matt's was astronomical!\" Asked myself, Am I really that hungry? Yes, Yes I AM!   Knowing that a trendy brunch place like this would attract a lot of locals and travelers. I had mentally prepped myself to wait an hour. But who knew Matt's big breakfast would be contained in such a small place. I had waited almost 90 minutes to be seated. Good thing it was breezy that day, or it woulda been pretty intense wait.  Once seated, pretty much knew exactly what I wanted to order until I saw the special. 3-egg scramble with andouille sausage, fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese. Sounds amazing. Got an order of that and an order of the Hog & Chick w/ hash browns.  The 3 egg scramble Definitely prettier dish of those 2. The presentation was definitely on point, the plate was full of fluffy eggs with melted fontina cheese on top. The rest of the plate was filled up with the country fries(potato). The bed of baby spinach added contrast to the plate. A dish that pleases the eye as much as the tongue. The andouille sausage/egg/fontina cheese was good combo. The flavor of all 3 really worked together, instead of fighting each other.  Hog & Chick w/ hash browns This one was less aesthetically pleasing. But don't let looks fool  you. This piece of pork chop is mighty tasty. The hash was real good. They browned both sides of the hash, and added some other stuff. It was tasty and had good consistency. Wish the chop was a thicker cut. I'd pay more for a thicker cut.  Everything here tasted good, and stood out from other diners. It was not expensive at all. But good food from a small place like that just means a long wait in line to be seated. I think they do take out. So'd recommend take out or showing up early.  But if I had to wait in line again, I would totally do it."}
{"text":"I wouldn't wait an hour in the heat, but the food is amazing, the pancakes and bacon especially, and who can fault hand-squeezed orange juice?  Come early, or in the middle of the week to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"The best hashbrowns I have ever had. Cripsy, buttery, not soggy or soaking in grease. Cooked well done, can't wait to go back. I went for brunch around 10:30-11am and the wait is not as bad as earlier in the morning."}
{"text":"Good food, decent prices, solid service...Didn't have to wait despite a bustling Friday morning scene...sat at the bar...Had the five on a spot breakfast sandwich which was very tasty...Lovely freshly squeezed orange juice, the real deal here. The con ? It's a very loud space....  I'm glad  I tried it after hearing how popular Matt's wash...Everything seems freshly prepared, the atmosphere is upbeat and you can be in and out of there in a snap...  Unfortunately, I live in North Scottsdale and there aren't places like Matt's by me...Hopefully one day. Good job mates...keep up the good work..."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had, the bacon was absolutely delicious. I really wanted French toast but they didn't have any I guess it's only a certain day. Well we were in town from CA we went to see the Rams & cardinals game. And this was the best food I had on our trip. I would go back for the bacon and pancakes"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Certainly beats out Denny's or IHOP. The eggs and French toast were amazing. I'll be finding myself back here soon enough :-)"}
{"text":"By far the worst experience of my life.  Not only did we wait forever to get seated but the food and service was horrible. The noise level was loud it was hard to have a conversation with the people in my party.  The waitress got my order all wrong.  We did not get our food at the same time.  My omelet was over cooked my daughter's waffle was undercooked.  I had high expectations based on previous reviews. Definitely not worth the wait.  Highly overrated...."}
{"text":"Come on, people.  The food is good, but it's not orgasmic.  And the service sucks.  It's freakin' breakfast, and there's really nothing remarkable about any of it, except that people line up out the door for what might as well be a self-serve diner, once you count a wait staff who are so completely stoned, inattentive, and possibly mentally-deficient that having a conversation as simple as ordering turns into a game of \"how is that possible an answer to the question I just asked, and what planet is he on?\"    The only thing worse than the service is the parking.   Better than McDonald's, not as good as Mom's."}
{"text":"Simply the best place in Arizona for breakfast!  Matt's does absolutely everything right.  No freezers in the back, fresh produce from the market, and quality ingredients all the way around shows just how amazing independent restaurants can be.  The obvious bad about Matt's is the wait.  There are few breakfast places that don't have a wait on Saturday or Sunday morning and Matt's is no exception.  The problem is, however, due to the limited capacity, the wait can become excessive.  I've never waited more than 90 minutes (that was with a group of 5) but when you are hungry, 20 minutes can seem like an hour.    If you can occupy yourself with a Kontakt or the Farmers Market long enough to stick around, the rewards are great.  Wonderful, quaint diner setting filled with bright white and orange walls and counters.  An intimate setting where you can be sure you will interact with at least someone else during your meal.    The food is great and I have yet to be disappointed.  I usually just order the Special, whatever it may be.  It makes it easier than trying to decide.  The Five Spot is another favorite of mine - egg and cheese breakfast sandwich that is top quality.  The wife always orders the hog and chick (meat and eggs).  The best part of every breakfast is the hashedbrowns that are cooked in butter and better than you've ever had them.  The workers are sweet and full of personality.  Matt sometimes stops in to drop off milk or eggs or to say Hi to his wife.  She is usually running around making sure everything goes smoothly.    Do not let the wait deter you.  Go to Matt's.  Take every one of your visiting relatives and friends to Matt's.  Make a special trip from the far east or west valley to go to Matt's.  Just don't do it the day that I go."}
{"text":"I had a difficult time finding great places to eat in Arizona. Maybe it's just me but I just couldn't find anything worth my money other than MATTS BIG BREAKFAST. it was really good and I was soooo happy that I found this place. The waffles are awesome and the bacon OMG the BACON super awesome get an extra side of it. You'll thank me later lol. They can have a bit of wait to be seated (30+min) so make sure you get there before you're stomach starts growling. Worth the wait super neat place."}
{"text":"Local Staple with Great Food  We frequent here almost every week, and the Camelback Matt's consistently delivers great food! My favorite dishes are the steak and eggs (steak is always perfectly cooked) and the chorizo cheddar jalapeño scramble special. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the menu options, and the portions live up to the name. Matt's modest focus on serving great food is a strong contrast to Scottsdale brunch spots that are more style over substance. More than likely we'll be right back here again next week!"}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwich was fantastic and a great start to our vacation, but far and away the real star was Michael. He was so energetic,  funny and helpful. I have flown through this airport at least 2x a month for 18 years and he has been the best server I have had. Thanks for truly kicking our vacation off right!"}
{"text":"First I have to say, we went to Matt's big breakfast after seeing them featured on Diner's Drive ins and Dives. Have to say its good but nothing special. The service was great, ambience good. We were pretty able to get seated right away. I ordered the cheese omelet with hashbrowns and hubby ordered the hog and chick. Hashbrowns good, bacon good, but wasn't really nothing special. Good portions, the flavor is fresh but just a basic breakfast. Menu was small not a lot to offer. Wouldn't say we wouldn't go back but its not all what its cracked up to be."}
{"text":"Best dang breakfast in Phoenix, fresh homemade and delish.  Definnitely worht the 45 minute wait.  The potatoes are to die for and the pork chop is, well what can I say you just have to try it out."}
{"text":"This place has the best breakfast and super reasonable.  I make it a point of going here every time I come to Phoenix.  I don't like coming to Phoenix but this place makes the medicine go down.  The bacon is insane!  The servers are great and you can get seated in a reasonable amount of time - 30 mins. on a Sunday during prime time.  My only complaint was the coffee was weak.  Totally surprised because I thought they served Stumptown, Intelligentsia, or something along that ilk.    I saw a review that said they didn't serve non-dairy milk.  Matt, I think you should offer almond milk or soy creamer.  It's really not that big of a deal.  Better yet why don't you MAKE your own almond milk.  I am totally confident you can make us proud.  Don't get me wrong because I don't think it's a restaurant's duty to cater to EVERY type of patron unless it makes business sense.  You do everything else so well why not be the only dog in town to be all things to all people.  Just sayin'............"}
{"text":"Not a fan at all! I randomly woke up one Saturday morning and researched the best breakfast in Phoenix. Matt's big breakfast was really close and voted very good. I showed up, drove around forever looking for parking, waited in line for 30min to be seated, then had very mediocre at best food. Overpaid for boring food, soda sold by the can, so no free refills. Very bad experience. Food wasn't good enough to recommend. We left very unsatisfied, then I believe went to burger king to satisfy our stomach"}
{"text":"I come here all the time!  Simple traditional and organic breakfast served every day! Friendly stuff and fast service. 10 out of 10"}
{"text":"Ever had slimy hash browns before?  Neither had I, before my visit here.  Definitely should've researched before I showed up at Matt's Big Breakfast because I've noticed I'm not the only one who wishes they had ordered home fries instead.  It's odd to me that you can only get certain menu items on certain days, especially since the regular menu is really small.  Service was just OK, but I'm usually impressed when I get better than terrible service at any restaurant or bar in Tempe.  If I go back, I'll probably order waffles or pancakes as that seems to be Matt's specialty;  I had eggs Benedict since it was Thursday and didn't find them to be special.  Would be 2 stars but I bumped it up for the cool location."}
{"text":"Great, friendly and beautiful staff! Food was amazing! The cheese omelett was amazing, hashbrowns to die for and freshly squeeze orange juice was amazing! Coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Menu items are simple and delicious. Pepper bacon is perfect. Homefries are light and perfectly cooked. Pork chop was flavorful and perfectly seasoned. Bread and homemade jam were perfect and the atmosphere and service are impeccable. I never had an empty glass or mug which is a rare treat at any small restaurant.  With a mix of industrial and retro, it's a hipster's delight, but no so much so that my hillbilly husband felt out of place. I'm hard to impress but this place did. Protip: come early or the line will be out the door but the food and service are worth the wait"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm biased because I can make a damn tasty breakfast myself at home, but for all the rave reviews and even being on TV, I expected this place to be a little above average.  Decent food, awesome waitstaff.  Let's weigh the pros and cons.  Pros: *good tasty bacon... *hashbrowns to die for - crunchy on the outside, creamy inside... *definite use of fresh ingredients...  Cons: *it felt like eating in my pantry with 25 other people... *all the cooks get to hear you peeing in the water closet (and I mean closet)...(maybe this is a problem only for the female persuasion?)... *almost $2 for a CAN of RC that probably cost them 25 cents, no free refills... *one egg was undercooked and one was overcooked... *feeling rushed to finish and get out of there as people outside stare at you wondering why you're taking so long to eat...  Oh and not to mention the butter burger that was ordered with blue maytag that I had to try a bite of - and ended up with a couple of tablespoons of hot boiling butter in my lap.  The maytag was yummy and fortunately I could taste it despite my scorched tongue.  We definitely left with full tummies (including my red burnt one) but more cons than pros means it was worth it to try for the first time, but I think the only item I might crave is the hashbrowns.  If I ever REALLY have to have their hashbrowns, I'll order it to go!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is cute and the menu is original. The place was really busy but the service was quick, short food wait time, and the service was friendly. Expect it to be loud since a lot of people enjoy eating there as much as we did. Great place to visit for yummy breakfast!"}
{"text":"I ate one meal meal here passing through at the Sky Harbor Airport.  Of course the restaurant name has \"breakfast\" in it but it was lunch time and I did not want breakfast.  I approached the desk and waited for a few minutes to be acknowledged.  I was seated at the only empty table in the place and wanted to make sure that there were non-breakfast items on the menu.  I decided on the chili cheeseburger with steak fries.  The patty was large which was good for me.  The chili surprised me because it it had beans in it.  I usually eat beef chili with no beans on my burgers.  The burger had good flavor to it as they use butter on the buns.  The fries were very good as I like the steak fries.  Overall the food was good.  It took a while to get seated but the service was friendly and was a good experience.  I didn't feel super rushed as the food came out fast enough and I had plenty of time to eat with time to spare to board my next flight.  I was definitely full when I left.  This was a three star experience for me."}
{"text":"Not impressed. My homemade pancakes are way better than these. Bacon and eggs were tasty, but again, pretty easy to duplicate at home. Plus, they nickel & dime you. $1.50 for extra maple syrup?!? I don't care if is the real stuff; that's just bad customer service. No need to come back."}
{"text":"I was treated to a great breakfast for my birthday.  We ordered waffle and bacon and steak and eggs. I had the delicious waffle.  I did try the steak and it was very tender and tasty.  They also have a cold coffee it's called nitron but didn't get to try but it's equivalent to a cold brew. This is a great cheat meal or if you just want a great treat."}
{"text":"This place has moved, couple blocks toward the freeway,  save your time it is way over rated. It is so noisey it hurts,  why people bring babies is beyond the border of cruel and inhuman punishment.   This was featured on Triple D, Guy you weren't in this place, the guy bussing tables & seating must own this because he's working harder than ALL the stuck up Waitress' combined. Probably not fair, some of the snobby girls were working, had to in order to makeup for the others. Maybe it's just age discrimination or ... .  Food was very limited, few egg plates, no flexibility didn't prepare as requested, had to send it bsck, while mine was getting cold trying to be polite and EAT TOGETHER.  We have deleted all reference to this & other MBB establishments, if this is how they hook us it's not worth it.  The food we finally did get wasn't anything special, beats McD, but not byuch except cost, way too oops much."}
{"text":"Teeny Tiny little place with little room to breath inside. Food was just OK IMO."}
{"text":"Long Long Long Long Long Long Long wait, for average food. I remember saying to myself \"We'll this was not worth the wait\" the entire time I was eating. If I knew I could get a seat right away, I might frequent this place. Otherwise, I am not wasting my entire morning waiting on a meal that I could make at home in 1/8 the time."}
{"text":"Love the way they converted Matt's to an airport concept. Much more successful than the attempt made by Lolo's Chicken & Waffles. For those of you just passing through Sky Harbor, these are both local Phoenix institutions worthy of a try.  I think Matt's effort here is more successful simply because they have their own dining space to manipulate, not a shared space. They use it well. Some tables. Lots of counter space for single travelers. Some communal seating. Lots of outlets. A take away counter. Great breakfast food early in the day and a full bar for later. Or breakfast food later in my case. A lunch menu is available as well. And it's all priced pretty reasonably for an airport. Well done."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in Phoenix. Everytime I go i get the special.. which changes every time.. can't go wrong.... it's a long wait and small place but it's worth the wait"}
{"text":"Matt's infinitesimal breakfast is pricey.  I was not very hungry so I thought I would order an egg and a little sausage with my drink.  What arrived was a tiny little patty of sausage that brought to mind that \"where's the beef\" commercial from the 80s.  The egg was fine and the service reasonable or this would be 1 star .  I feel cheated."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.   I tried the downtown location and this location is just as good,  but bigger.   Line out the door so be prepared to wait.   I got the Salami and eggs with home fries and tortillas.   The salami was excellent.    The eggs were cooked perfectly.   The home fries were great.   My wife got the cheese omelette with hash browns and toast.   The omelette looked average,  but then again a cheese omelette is kind of plane.   Hash browns liked like normal hash browns.   I recommend the home fries.     The toast and homemade strawberry jam are a must.   The people next to us got the ham steak and bacon.   They looked great.     Next time I may just get eggs with toast and bacon because everything will be awesome."}
{"text":"Yay, finally got to try this place today. I had the waffle which came with two slices of bacon and I added an overeasy egg. Best Belgian style waffle I have ever had. It really is amazing. Butter was tasty and I even loved their syrup (I normally despise syrup). Their syrup lacked that really pungent smell that usually makes me a little sick. And it was a lot thinner than most syrups I've seen. Very yummy. You can tell everything is really fresh. Would highly recommend it. Service was friendly and came around frequently, but the wait and metered parking knocked it down from 5 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"So, everyone and their grandmas been talking about this place, I had to tske my family here to try it out. Nice layout. Love thw chalk board special.  :) So, Ummmm yeah. Phenomenal breakfast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My cheese veggie omelet was amazing, I asked for jalapeño in it whooo. It was bombbb. the hashbrown was crispy yet soft. I loved my meal :))  The waffles were delicious :)) oh, and the wheat bread, it was thick and so filling.. It came with strawberry jam.   Service wise. We had literally five people helping us.lolz. when we needed napkins or more water, we didn't know who to go to.   Anyways. I'll be coming back. :)"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever eaten. I travel for a living and therefore eat out a lot. Matt's had great reviews and exceeded them and my expectations with super friendly service and amazing food. $14 I've paid a lot more for much worse. Excellent!"}
{"text":"After a late incoming flight and not much sleep, I woke up hungry and needing caffeine in the worst possible way. When my sister woke up we began exploring breakfast options before heading out for a hike. She mentioned this place and a few others but this one was the only one I had Bookmarked on Yelp and I'd really hate to waste all my research time. So we loaded up and arrived around 9am and there was already a 30-minute wait--ordinarily I would've gone elsewhere but I was on vacation and the weather was perfect so we just chilled. Almost 30-minutes to the T we sat down and ordered our repast.   Coffee- I thought it was pretty standard diner coffee; nothing good but nothing great. Apparently they sell bags of it to take home if you really find yourself enamored with it. 3*  Bacon- Pretty amazing tasting bacon--might be the best I've had at a breakfast place. It's thick-cut and loaded with pepper and you can tell it's high quality stuff. 5*  Sausage Patties- Pretty good homemade sausage patties that had some nice spice to them. 3.75*  Waffle- My sister jocks their Waffle pretty hard and after having a taste I can see why. It's light, crisp and has a terrific Buttermilk flavor. She eats it without syrup (heresy, I know), but I can see why.  4.5*  The Chop and Chick- This breakfast comprised of two Eggs over-medium, bone-in Pork Chop, Country Potatoes and Sourdough toast. The eggs were cooked perfectly; the potatoes were great and I really liked the Rosemary they put with them; the Sourdough was hearty, but nowhere on the level of SF Sourdough; and the Pork Chop was cooked well and left a bit pink--the way pork should be. My only qualm was that everything was served with very little to no salt on it; which is fine, I suppose, because I'd rather it be under than over. 4*  Blueberry Jam- This came with the Sourdough Toast and it really deserves its own special category because Matt's really outdoes themselves with it. Maybe the best blueberry jam I've ever had--not too sweet and tremendous blueberry flavor. 5*  Service & Ambiance- Really good and friendly service that kept my coffee cup full and checked on us frequently. Matt's looks a lot bigger inside than does outside and has a modern-industrial feel to it. 4*  Value- Everything is very reasonably priced as none of our dishes cost more than $10; compared to the Bay Area this is an outstanding value. 5*  Matt's is a terrific Diner that offers top quality food; fast and good service; and is value priced. I'd probably rate it at a solid 4.5-stars but I'll round it down to four because the underseasoned breakfast was a bit annoying. Other than that it's highly recommended if you're in the Downtown Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Great fresh breakfast with outstanding bacon and decent coffee. My omelet had large cuts of peppers and onions but no avocado ... Wish it had the avocado."}
{"text":"I was on a detox/diet when we came here. They did great at accommodating my requests. Will definitely be back again to try the pancakes. They looked amazing."}
{"text":"Took two brother-in-laws who had just arrived to spend a week here from Northern California. Food was just ok nothing or standing or memorable in a good way about it. Service was below average. I don't really care to get my toast half way into my meal with hard butter that couldn't even think about melting. Ask for creamer and be prepared for the \"organic\" blah blah blah. Hash browns were mushy and they could not accommodate adding onions and peppers into them.  I've been to the other locations and it's always been an average experience."}
{"text":"My potatoes were swimming in olive oil. Service was great but limited menu compared to other breakfast places in the area."}
{"text":"Nice brunch place! The wait was about 20 minutes for a Saturday morning. The host called out name when we were at the farmers market but he put his bag in front of the line when we came back. The hashbrown was different from most hashbrown you would get at like a Denny's. It was a brick shape where it's really crispy on the outside but on the inside it was soft so I wasn't sure if it was cooked all the way. Not bad though! Just nothing too special from most brunch places."}
{"text":"The food tastes amazing. I don't want to know how much butter they used to make my waffle, but I sure made it disappear. The staff is intelligent, friendly and efficient. There is sometimes a wait to eat here, but they have a waiting list and try to get new customers in quickly. I have eaten here twice this school semester (it's very close to the ASU downtown Phoenix campus) and I keep talking new classmates into going back with me. The ingredients are fresh and very high quality. No wonder they were featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive- ins and Dives. Yum! Try the omelet, it's my favorite."}
{"text":"Jennifer, thank you for your great attitude today; you were genuinely very sweet and gave stellar service to me and the folks at my tall table.  You were very attentive, and went above and beyond to give us what we wanted.  The lady next to me did not like bacon that is not super crispy. You saw she did not eat it and came right back with some lean, crispy pieces. She took my silverware :)  The gentlemen next to me asked for a drink which Matt's serves on ice which he is not used to. You quickly apologized and wanted to make it right.  Matt, you need to give her a raise to keep her on staff; folks like Jennifer are rare and you cannot afford to lose valuable employees like her.   This is a great spot if you are sick of standardized chain food in airports looking to serve shareholders rather than customers BTW."}
{"text":"Place is super cute and very busy for a Thursday morning. We ordered the Eggs Benedict's (Thursday special) and waffles. The waffles were delicious and worth getting! The bacon was my favorite part, it had this peppery smoke to it! The Benedict's were just ok for me. The English toast that the poach egg and ham sits on isn't my favorite and the hollandaise sauce wasn't a wow for me. BUT, there hash browns extra crispy we're so good for being thicker than what you usually see for hash browns. Place was packed but service was fast!   A lot of reviewers mention friendly staff but we didn't get that warm, happy and welcoming vibe. Host was a gentlemen and he wasn't rude but was running around the place and just quickly took your name (appreciate that his a fast and hard worker but a quick hello and letting us know how long wait wouldn't hurt). Our server wasn't rude but also did her job, hello. Took our order. Checked back. Drop check. Nothing engaging to remember or make the visit better. When dropping off a check, one should let the guest know when your ready to pay, you can take it to the encounter. Don't assume everyone is from that town..."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in Arizona. A must try for anyone visiting or new to the valley! This place is money."}
{"text":"Not sure what I can say that everyone else has not already said:  Their Pork Chop is excellent, I generally get the Waffle (it is very hard to get a good waffle that uses it's own batter versus pancake batter) and sub out the bacon for the Pork Chop (+4.25), their hashbrowns are amazing one of the best ever (per Mrs D) and their homemade strawberry preserves are exceptional  The more simple a dish is, the higher the execution needs to be and the sourcing of the ingredients needs to be, and Matt's does an excellent job of both - They do a great job with a small menu that they can execute at a high level, for American Breakfast food you cannot beat Matt's if you can get there before it is packed"}
{"text":"Thought it was very high priced for what you get. When we got there and walked in there was no hostess and people were all over the place. Finally a guy came up and asked our name and how many in the party. Then he just walked away. We didn't know if we were on a list or even if there was a list. Finally I went up to the counter and asked if we were on any list and turns out he had put us on a list but didn't have our name correct. None the less we got seated eventually. The food was good but not out of this world My wife and I each had breakfast, orange juice and I had coffee. With tip it was almost 40 dollars. For that price I thought we should be able to take the pig home with us."}
{"text":"First timers at Matt's! Overall really liked the place! It was a little difficult to find at first but once we parked it was all good. You get 2 hours free parking if you park in the garage. My fiancé ordered their special of the day which was a chorizo scramble came with two tortillas and home fry potatoes. I ordered The Skinny which came with a side lightly dressed salad. Food was great! At first we ordered water with lemon but it tasted like dirty tap water. Ended up getting an iced tea and a coffee. We asked for to go drinks and it was no problem. Would definitely return again if in the area."}
{"text":"By far THE BEST place to go for breakfast when you're in Phoenix.  Now stop reading, get off the Internet and get to Matt's right now.  The line will be long.  Enough said..."}
{"text":"If the Chop and Chick is Guy Fieri's favorite breakfast dish, his credibility has dropped a few points.  I wanted to like it... heck, this was one of the reasons I drove out to Phoenix, but the pork chop didn't do it for me.  It was dry and there just wasn't enough pesto to grab my attention.   The hash browns saved the meal for me though.  They reminded me of the way my mom used to make them: very thinly-sliced, a little on the oily side and extremely crispy.  I can eat this forever.   Yes, the place is small and the wait is long, but I won't dock any points for that, even though it was in 100+ degree weather; waiting is all part of the experience."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have been to the original Matt's location. I love the original Matt's location. So I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this one on a long layover in Phoenix. I was a little skeptical when I got closer. The walls are subway tile and there is a lot of orange and chrome, making it feel more like a diner than the funky downtown Matt's. Not only do they have breakfast all day, but they have a Ruben. A crazy good Ruben. Upgrade to the steak fries, you'll be glad you did!  The rye bread was buttery and toasty.  The corned beef was flavorful and tender. To top it off, my server Miguel was awesome. I travel for work, so I eat alone a lot. He was attentive without being intrusive. When you dine alone you tend to notice when service is slow or around too much. Miguel really had a knack for being there at the right time. Thanks for the great dinner. I will now have to schedule my trips with a long layover in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Breakfast review. Came in when it opened. Waited a while to be served. No gluten free menu options. No fruit options instead of bread, only a sliced tomato. Only dairy options for coffee (no heavy cream). Having a place with cage-free eggs doesn't necessarily make you a healthy option merely conscientious. Probably wouldn't return. I also thought it was slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"Small cozy joint.... great coffee... friendly servers....simple menu.  Another Triple D find worth going to...... I am finding Guy F. loves Arizona... after spending a week here I can see why.. tons of good eats super little time! Got here after the business people but before the slacker crowd (back home that means somewhere between 8:30 and 9 AM). So we had no wait....  I got the five spot which totally kept me full for hours...that and the three cups of local coffee... The peppery bacon this joint uses is to die for...My five spot: The sweet onions, the bun, the bacon and the perfectly cooked eggs.... solid breakfast. I had a taste of Julie K's griddlecakes and they were yummy.   I appreciate simplicity and this place has some basics on the menu but do them well. Reasonably priced menu... I highly recommend :-).  Few things 1. BRING QUARTERS ....  lots of places to park but it is metered parking 2. come early and make sure EVERYONE in your party is there 3. Bathroom is next door (TALK TO MIKEY.. he is a very wise and amazing person)"}
{"text":"Matt's is the best. The food is simple, but delicious! Great atmosphere with reasonable pricing!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten there yet and after reading all the reviews it made this fat boy hungry. I'm heading there when I get in town on June 30, 2016!!!!"}
{"text":"I love matts big breakfast!!! it's such an amazing place to start off your morning, but it's always packed (even though they recently expanded), so give yourself some time to find parking and wait for a table. their service and staff is amazing, your glass will never find itself empty. the waffles are ridiculous and I've never had a weekly special that I didn't absolutely love. totally worth checking out."}
{"text":"I have found that during the summer on a Sunday morning before 930 is the best time to go to Matt's....at least that is my favorite time.   Why you may ask? No wait!  I have yet to wait in line at all when I go that early.  But mostly I have been by myself and I find a seat at the counter.    While I scan through the specials, I find myself more often than not, getting the Hog and Chick with Bacon and Hashbrowns.  I have tried the sausage patties and the ham.  I was not impressed by the saugage and while the ham is VERY good, the bacon still wins out.  The hashbrowns alone keep coming back for more and I am not a big potatoe fan.  But I admit I am spoiled living just a few blocks away...."}
{"text":"Rather than making this another dissertation on every detail of my restaurant experience, I'll try for once to keep it short and sweet. I came here on a Tuesday morning with my friend and my toddler, after a short wait we were seated. We both ordered the bacon and eggs with hash browns. Mine scrambled, hers sunny side up and I also got a pancake on the side for the toddler and me to share (so he wouldn't steal all of my scrambled eggs). The food came pretty quickly and everything was good. My friend said the hash browns were better seasoned last time she was there (they needed a little salt). They were actually made from honest to god, real potatoes, and when was the last time you saw that? I saw in the reviews that they have the best scrambled eggs but I wouldn't go that far. They were good. They also needed a sprinkling of salt and pepper but they were not the best. You have to go to Essence for that. The bacon was nice and thick and delicious and the raisin bread that came with my breakfast delighted my toddler. My pancake was OK. It tasted like a typical good restaurant buttermilk pancake. It did come with warm syrup though and that always makes me happy. Would I come here again? Sure! Would I wait in line on a Saturday for an hour and half? Are you f-ing kidding me?"}
{"text":"Amazing. Well worth the wait no matter how long. The coffee is delicious, the food is fresh, the pancakes are divine."}
{"text":"I was so pleased with the service and the food. I had the chop and chick. The chop was juicy and seasoned well, and the potatoes with rosemary were delicious. I would go again. The wait was a little long but worth it in the end."}
{"text":"After spending a whole year thinking Matt's Big Breakfasts logo was too similar to Whataburgers to be coincidence, I finally decided to go out on a limb and check it out. Turns out, the decor is cute and simple...sort of farm house-y. Definitely not what I was expecting! I came around 10am by myself since it was a pit stop before Safeway. The place is always packed, and this morning was no exception. Thankfully, there were some seats at the \"bar\" - perfect for solo diners. It took exactly 14 minutes for anyone to acknowledge me, and I only point that out because everyone else around me got greeted etc. almost immediately.  I got my order in - the waffle with bacon - and it came out in a flash. I can definitely tell that everything here is fast fast fast. Their menu is not painfully extensive, and they cover the basics and have a sprinkle of unique dishes. Everything looked pretty food, and I would consider coming back to try something else.  My actual meal was delicious. I wouldn't go all out and say it was the best waffle ever, but it was pretty darn up there. The portion was pretty spot on. Looking around, I'd say that everyone else had plenty of food on their plates. Their bacon is thick cut, peppery, crispy on the edges, perfectly fatty, aaaand I need to stop because my mouth is watering.   Overall, food was good, and the prices are reasonable. I would also note that they don't have alcohol (if that's a concern)."}
{"text":"After consulting Reddit on what I should check out for breakfast, Matt's Big Breakfast seemed to be the resonating winner across different comments and \"Best Of\" lists.  I ordered the hog and the chick and my girlfriend had their Friday scramble. Both sounded promising, but maybe because we aren't breakfast people that it didn't really strike me as anything special.  Overall, my breakfast plate was just mediocre throughout. The bacon was bacon, the eggs were eggs, and the hash browns were just hash browns. You get the idea.  My girlfriend's home fries were good, but someone went HAM on the rosemary. I love rosemary. I use it when I sous-vide my ribeyes, or if I'm reverse searing some ribeyes with butter, but this was just too much. It was overpowering and I couldn't enjoy the potatoes themselves. It tasted like I just ate a sprig of rosemary.  Service was good though and the prices were reasonable. I probably would have enjoyed their lunch items more though."}
{"text":"Our waiter, Michael, was GREAT! He was entertaining and wonderful! My order wasn't 100% correct, but it was super yummy anyway!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here before and felt very welcomed. But today. It's a beautiful day out side. And we wanted to sit on the patio. We were made to feel it was a inconvenience. Then the food showed up on a dirty plate. Service really needs help."}
{"text":"What can be said that hasn't been already. First time back in a long time, when they were at the other location a block over. Excellent - went Hog & Chick, add Chicken Apple Sausage. How the heck do the make something so simple so good??!!  You have to try it to understand. 6 Stars! The new location looks great."}
{"text":"Best pancakes I've had so far.  Bkfst potatoes were very good.  Salami omelette wasn't the best so I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"I have been hearing rave reviews about this place from all my co-workers, so I decided to give it a go.  I called to place an order and the girl accidentally hung up on me. I don't know why that bothers me so much, maybe it's just because you should know how to operate your phone?  When I went to pick up my order the place is busy, as always which is a great thing. It's like going to a Mexican restaurant and seeing Mexicans, it just means the food is good.   I got the omelet with onions and ham, with hash browns and wheat toast. The top half of the hash browns were on point, crisp and tasty. The bottom half . . . soggy and soaked in grease. GROSS.   The omelet was huge! If you are looking for a lot of food this is the place to go, though if you are looking for taste I would skip the omelet. The only thing that didn't taste like cardboard was the ham. Thank God for the ham.   The wheat toast was ok, though the spread they include has chunks of fruit in it and is amazing.  Don't order the OJ to go. You get about 3oz. of it in a plastic sippy cup. I don't know if they thought I was heading to the airport?   Anyway, if you want a huge obese enticing portion go here you will get it. If you are looking for a non soggy breakfast I would keep looking."}
{"text":"I'm from out of state, and my father and I love going to places that we see on Drive-Ins, Diners, & Dives. Although we hadn't seen this episode, we had heard good things about it. I'm not much of a breakfast person but I made an exception here. Their Waffle is one of the best tasting waffles I have ever had. The cream butter and powdered sugar topping was well portioned; their 100% pure maple syrup was an amazing touch to the waffle as well. Also, make sure that at at least one person in your party gets their homemade Honey Lemonade, especially their raspberry one if it's available. Their bacon is thick and cooked nice and crispy. I would definitely come back again if I were in town and it is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place had absolutely delicious and unique breakfast food! The service was great too. I only wish we lived closer and we'd be there all the time."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service! I only wish we lived closer and we'd be there all the time. The potatoes were so good, I ate every last one and barely had room for the rest of the delicious stuff on my plate."}
{"text":"Happy St. Patrick's Day :-)  I can't believe this was my first time coming to Matt's Big Breakfast!!   \"I'll be back\" (in my best Arnold from Terminator voice)  Wow what an amazing experience. Definitely worth the trip/journey if you'er not in the area. Don't let the wait time scare you, it's so worth it.   We had to wait a half an hour to get seated, which wasn't too bad. The beautiful AZ weather made it a pleasant wait and it went by quick.  We were seated at the bar which was quick and convenient, but the bar stools were not that comfortable.    The food came out relatively quick for how packed the place was.    I wanted either pancakes, french toast or a waffle.  The waffle decision was made easily because the side of bacon it came with sealed the deal for me.  The waffle was cooked to the perfect consistency and you could tell the batter was home made and not some Bisquik instant waffle. Very flavorful.  The side of crisp peppered bacon was the perfect savory compliment to the sweet delicious waffle.    I also sampled my buddy's pancakes, they were amazing, very tasty.  Simple menu, but the food speaks for itself.  I can't wait to come back and try something else ;-)"}
{"text":"Love the food. Love the staff. Hate the wait. Only solution for us is to try to hit it at an off time. Good luck. The bacon is superb and the rosemary potatoes are a can't miss. Everything else, including the vaunted pork chops, are good, but hardly off the chart. I get the charm thing, but it's breakfast and I'm hungry. Find me a seat."}
{"text":"I think there was way...too much hype for this little place. The food is good, but it wasn't worth waiting over an hour to eat here. I was lucky enough to have come by here and while waiting I walked over to the Farmer's Market, it helped kill my waiting time and standing in the heat.  No joke that the place is tiny. They do have a friendly staff and have lots of staff to help with the crowds they get. So the service is good. I had The Chop & Chick, the chop was pretty tasty. The homefries were just okay, the hash browns tasted better. I also tried The Five Spot and it was good. There are lots of great reviews on the bacon from this place and...it is good, but I wouldn't want to pay $2.50 for a side order of bacon."}
{"text":"Not recommended in any sense! Matt's Big Breakfast might be the slowest restaurant I've ever experienced. The quality of the food was barely approaching average and the cost was typical of an airport eatery. It was probably half full of customers and they appeared to have a full wait staff on hand. I sat at the bar and saw at least ten plates ready for delivery in the kitchen while the staff just wandered about ignoring it. The only people that appeared mildly interested in working were the cooks and the bartender. That being said my egg and bacon bagel was of the quality typical of a hungover college student. For the amount of time that I waited and the cost I could have left the airport and eaten at an actual restaurant."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I am usually not the biggest fan of breakfast places, as breakfast is not my favorite meal of the day, BUT this place is my new favorite. You may spend the extra dollar here and there, but the portions are huge and very tasty. I had the omelette and hashbrowns, and honestly, I don't know if my mom could have made them better!  Another nice surprise was their jelly/jam. It was fresh and flavorful-not at all like a Smuckers package!  I'm very glad to say I'm within walking distance because I know I'll be coming back for more. I would say though, the lines are long for a reason! Save yourself some time and call it in to go if you have the chance!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic !! Came into town from California and it hit the spot!  Place is super trendy and friendly .. Ice tea was bomb !! Daniel .. and Janiel are so sweet !! Sit in their section"}
{"text":"Was told this was a \"must do\" for brunch in Phoenix - wait was about 45 mins for 3 people.  The 5 spot and hash browns came highly recommended by Russ, the bartender at Bitter & Twisted.    I would say the overall sandwich was good, the bacon was good, the roll was ok and the hashbrowns, while crispy on both sides, was runny in the middle!  Not great.  My sister had the home fries and said it was delish.  The honey lemonade was really good though.  Service was nice and efficient but I think overall, not worth the hype and/or wait."}
{"text":"Great specials, decent service. Definitely a local hotspot. Board was not current."}
{"text":"This is the #1 local breakfast restaurant chain in Arizona. The way they make classic breakfast food doesn't compare with any breakfast restaurant I have ever been too. Only the best ingredient's. My favorite is Hog and Chick with hash browns, thick bacon, sourdough toast and homemade strawberry preserves."}
{"text":"Good breakfast at typical airport prices. The bacon is good quality and peppered and the strawberry jam tastes homemade. The wheat toast is thick multigrain and tastes like Beyond Bread."}
{"text":"There are very few places that I'm completely OK with waiting thirty to forty-five minutes to eat breakfast, much less in the Phoenix heat, but when it comes to Matt's Big Breakfast I don't think twice about it.  It's actually a regular occurrence, while sitting on the outdoor waiting benches, for the guests who are leaving to assure you it is worth the wait.  The place is small, you might even say cramped depending on where you are sat, but the food is second to none.  I always get the special, which varies from day to day.  It's typically a scrambler with generous helpings of meat and cheese, and some locally grown veggies or peppers.  I recommend a side of home fries with rosemary as opposed to the hash browns.  If you're not in the mood for eggs try the waffle or pancakes (seriously it's just all good), and if bread doesn't come with what you order you've got to try the sourdough toast with house made organic blueberry jelly...so delicious.  In addition to the amazing food, the service is always great.  Hands down, Matt's Big Breakfast is my favorite breakfast stop."}
{"text":"The food at Matt's was delicious!  Went there on Thursday and got there around 10 and only waited 5 minutes.  I had the pork chop which comes with eggs, potatoes, and toast.  My son had the waffle with bacon. I also ordered a side of bacon so I could try it as we'll.  It was all delicious.  The food was very flavorful and well seasoned.  My son is 10 years old and is a picky eater.  He loved the waffle and ate almost his whole plate.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just as wonderful as the downtown location.  Even one more advantage is they have French toast on their regular menu and it is a special at the downtown location.  I ordered it this morning and amazing as always!  They opened up around 5;40 am and I was able to order and eat and be done by 6am to make my 6:30 flight.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good here. I went here for the first time because Snooze AM had a horribly long wait. I have had one of the breakfast sandwiches here and the pancakes. Sandwich was good, pancakes are excellent. If you are looking for a place to go out for breakfast or brunch, then this is a good place to try out."}
{"text":"Here's what I look for in a breakfast place: good coffee, good food, good service, fair prices. This place meets all of those criteria, so you can be assured that this restaurant is good."}
{"text":"The Chop and the Chick..............oh my pesto encrusted pork chop will I ever get to have you again? It was over 100 degrees, it was over an hour wait, but they keep ice water outside so you don't die, and, in my opinion, its worth the wait to experience dining inside- at least once. After that if you wanna come back, just order your goods to go.   But back to the pork chop.......it was incredible. It was perfectly cooked, and sometimes Porkchops are hit or miss when it comes to moist and dry. But this chop was plump and moist and pesto-y and out of this world. The ambiance and decor of this place was retro-vintage-mod, mostly white w/little but unique decor.  I loved my dining experience there, from the service to the food.  I'd definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I have only been there once, so I will probably go back to give it another shot, but I can tell you that I had a very basic breakfast, and it was good...but very overpriced.  $11 for scrambled eggs, toast and potatoes?? I'll give it one more shot and try something with a bit more substance, but for now...I think there are other places nearby that I would lean towards before here.  The only major upside is that it's close to the same parking lot as my office."}
{"text":"A serious disappointment. The original Matts big breakfast is great but the airport one is nothing like it and the food is just overpriced and tasteless."}
{"text":"First time at Matt's and breakfast was great.  Waffles were made perfect served with a side of thick bacon which was nice and smokey.  Griddle cakes were light, yet rich and melted in your mouth.  Atmosphere was extremely casual and help was warm and welcoming.  I will definitely go back, already craving the waffles with bacon."}
{"text":"Great breakfast stop! It seems to be popular with local and out-of-towners, so it may be busy - the food is worth a short wait though! Service was friendly and fast with the prices also being very reasonable.  I really enjoyed the griddlecakes - great consistency with a slight sweetness. Their bacon is also excellent - peppered and cut thick.  All in all, MBB is a great find for a tasty breakfast. Be sure to check out their location in the Phoenix airport as well!"}
{"text":"Loved the Rueben! House roasted corned beef and spicy mustard on the side. Great value for unique food."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! My son who is beyond picky ate his whole meal!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for the weekend found this place on the best breakfasts in Phoenix. Definitely glad we came. We got there about 8:35 ish. We waited for about thirty minutes. It was well worst the wait. The service was great food was delish! I had the Hog and chick. It came with toast and home fries. Everything was so yummy! The house made strawberry jam was delightful! Stocked we came! This place has made this girl very happy! :)"}
{"text":"I'm pretty pumped that its cooling off outside cause I'll be able to make my way down to Matt's for breakfast on Saturdays again. I tend to stay away during the summer months cause I sweat like a fat kid in a cannibal camp and would rather not wait the hour or so it takes to be seated.   Very few places in town do I feel as \"at home\" as I do at Matt's. The staff is always friendly as are most of the patrons. For such a long wait and for the patrons to be in such good moods they have to be doing something right! The food is fantastic. I love how they find locally grown and raised food and only stock what is in season. The food alone makes Matt's one of my favorite spots for breakfast in town, but its the consistency in the ambiance that makes it my #1 breakfast spot in town."}
{"text":"This place rocks. The food is great. The owner is awesome and very friendly. The service is just as good as the one downtown. Since this is less than a mile from my house I will be here a lot. I am so glad they are open in the neighborhood now :)"}
{"text":"The wait was a little long but the waitress was able to take or ordered while we waited, as soon as we were seated our food arrived. I had the waffles with bacon.  The bacon was crisp and the waffles were like cake, so delicious."}
{"text":"Fate led me to dine at Matt's Big Breakfast yesterday. We drove by this tiny restaurant while on our way to find somewhere to eat brunch. The sign indicated that they are closed on Mondays but we saw people eating inside so we sent a representative to inquire. I should note that the restaurant closes at 2:30pm and we arrived at 2:25. The waitresses were more than happy to serve us even though they were technically not supposed to be open. Score!  I ordered the insider burger (not on the menu) and it was honestly one of the best burgers I have ever had! How is this possible, you ask? First off, the meat is cooked in butter. You heard me right. Butter. Second, the burger is topped with 2 eggs AND bacon. As if this weren't enough to convince you, it comes with a side of homemade chips and a pickle. Love it! I didn't even care that my face was covered in egg yolk.  If you're more in the mood for breakfast, Matt's has plenty of options. Their breakfast potatoes have the most intense rosemary flavoring, the bacon is thick and tasty and their homemade toast and jam is wonderful. Order anything on the menu and you won't be disappointed. This is a great restaurant with friendly service and awesome food."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the wait.    55 minute wait of close to in order to have been given the waitress Allison and her sour mood.  Never once smiled, did not bring the order correctly (and when I mentioned it, she rolled her eyes and smacked her gums as if I was the problem.  I said I have a pork and berry allergy (so please no jelly) and I did check to see if they used different pans and cooked on different grills.  My food came with Jelly; and as I said when I mentioned it to her; chomped her gums and rolled her eyes.  The nicest person in the place was the man whom was cleaning tables.  He was constantly smiling and just a great aura about him.  The GM I am guessing was nice enough to come ask me how extreme an allergy was.  IT IS AN ALLERGY and if I AM SAYING SO, must be EXTREME!  My dates food came, mine came roughly 7-9 minutes after; I am glad she did not wait or hers would be cold.  I had an open face cheese omelet as when you walk in the door you see their staff checking other omelets with a  fork on the window sill and then putting it back - to then check another one.  To me that is a bit gross and with a food allergy (thus me asking for open face), it concerns me.  Cheese omelet should have been called open face greasy melt...  Lastly, one other gross thing that caught my attention.  The man collecting payment, he touches money (counting it as well as collecting from patrons, credit cards and the such, even picked up trash from the floor; then turns to the window and brings food to a table.  Never once in my 1.25 hours there did I see him wash his hands or leave the floor.  They will not go broke do to my one post - yet if it helps one person - then I am glad.  I would not go back, service sucked other then GM, food was second rate, and wait time - not worth it."}
{"text":"Giving this place 5 stars because it is definitely the best breakfast spot in Arizona.   Everything was cooked well and was delicious, felt like homemade breakfast, not like the Venice chain breakfast places. Tried the honey lemonade it was a bit sweet for me but still was good.   Really enjoyed my breakfast here, and the staff was friendly! Will come back here hopefully before I leave back to Cali."}
{"text":"I've heard a good number of acquaintances say how good Matt's is so I was glad when a small group of friends wanted to meet here for breakfast.  First I'll say the staff are very friendly. Most everyone I saw made it a point to make eye contact and say hello.  That is so unusual by today's standards.    The coffee was good, much better than typical diner coffee and staff kept our cups full & hot. Each of our breakfasts were hearty and good.  Portions were reasonable and we all walked away full.  I'd describe it as good home cookin' with very fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"If you check out my profile, you will see that I don't often leave negative reviews, however I'm going to have to add one for the terrible food I received here today.  I ordered the Biggest Breakfast with scrambled eggs and what came out can only be described as the single worst plate of breakfast \"food\" I have ever received. Most of the components where flat out inedible. My scrambled eggs were the consistency of an eraser. The eggs were clearly forgotten about on the griddle and simply chopped up when it came time to plate them, after they set into hard plastic discs. The sausage was even worse! Small salty dried out pucks. I actually knocked them on the plate and they made a hard pinging sound which amused my neighbors. The potatoes were soggy with grease and tasted like funky rosemary. My hotcake came out flat as a crepe. It at least was edible after I drenched it in butter and syrup. Even the bacon was dry and chewy. How do you mess up bacon???  I hope the management starts to pay better attention to the quality of the food being served. I've worked in restaurants before so I know breakfast can be especially hard to manage and I don't like leaving bad reviews but what happened today was inexcusable."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  Crowded and loud but food was fabulous!  Service was great and will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"You know those mornings when you don't want to wake up? When you just want to lay there and rot?  Well, next time you feel that way and roll yourself out of bed, reward yourself with breakfast at Matt's Big Breakfast!  YUMMMMMY.  It's all you need sometimes.   It's like homemade breakfast served to you in a cheery atmosphere, even a fresh little flower on your table."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast at PHX! Service was 5and the food was really good. Wonderful bacon and potatoes. The pancakes were freshly made and super yummy. Our server Michael H. Is great and made us feel like family. Good job!"}
{"text":"Peppered bacon and sweet cream butter griddle cakes.  Mmmmm.  The griddle cakes get this nice little crispy edge on them.  Can I get a big woooooot wooooot!!!  MBB is an awesome LITTLE joint to stop at for breakfast.  I stress little because while the food is tall in stature, the place is small small small.  If you're going to go on the weekend, go early.  You probably have much less chance of a wait during the week.    Definitely a hot spot for breakfast in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick bite based on friend's suggestion.  The food was pretty good and service was attentive.  I ordered the Skinny, which had so much sausage I had to leave most of it. The salad it came with was dripping with sauce, way overdressed.  I left half of it too.  Not bad, but no where near what I expected."}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite breakfast place in the whole wide world. If I lived in Phoenix I would probably go broke because I'd be here every day. The pancakes are everything a pancake should be: fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. The home fries are an explosion of flavor in your mouth. I look forward to eating here every time I visit!"}
{"text":"Food fair @ best. Got the BLT which was on dry toast & over done bacon- Cole slaw was an upgrade dont bother! Dry cabbage is what you get- Tomato soup is pretty good tho it takes an act of Congress to get some oyster crackers to go with it. Customer Service sucks! Had to go up to the bar to get a soda refill not once but twice & to ask for crackers- Waiter no where around- this is the 2nd time we tried this place with the same terrible customer service- don't waste your time- there are plenty of other good places in the terminal to get a good meal with good customer service!"}
{"text":"Wait, you're shitting me, right?  35mins+ wait in the hot sun to eat bacon and eggs?  No way."}
{"text":"Came from airport with family visiting us. Daughter found this on Yelp. I wish I was hungry because everyone ordered very delicious items at a very affordable price. The service was equally exceptional, never had an empty cup or glass. Every time I looked up someone came over to see if I needed anything. Downsize is you need quarters for the meters. This breakfast in North Scottsdale would be three times as much with half the food."}
{"text":"I was staying in Phoenix overnight at the Sheraton & didn't want to pay $20 for the average quality buffet in the hotel.  This place is a short walk (10 mins) from the Sheraton & the food was excellent.  I arrived was quickly seated at a very busy place. I selected the Skinny without cheese & really enjoyed the turkey sausage, egg white omelette & the fresh salad.  The staff were extremely friendly & the atmosphere in the place was fun to go with the decor!!  It ended up being about $14 as I got tea as well.  I will be back the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The food here is goooood!  It can take a while to get in but once you are seated that service is fast and efficient.  This is a favorite spot!  We take out of town visitors here all the time and they love it.  The sourdough toast is amazing, and I really like that everything is pretty much fresh locally sourced!"}
{"text":"At first I wasn't a fan of this location, after being a downtown regular our first couple of visits here were honestly disappointing.  Everything from food arriving cold or one time burnt, to waiting almost 45 minutes to get food at all after ordering.    This location is closer to home and so we waiting anxiously for this new location to open... however, once it did it was not the well oiled machine we were used to downtown, far from it.  So we took a few months off and gave it another shot, the last three times we have been here have been great... whatever kinks or growing pains they were having have been worked out and service is now quick and friendly, and the food is on par with the downtown location.     I am a huge fan of Matt's so I held off on writing this review for quite awhile but after another good meal this last Saturday I would now recommend this location.   There is typically a 30-45 minute wait during peak breakfast hours.   I WISH THEY HAD A TEXT BASED RESERVATION SYSTEM... but otherwise solid four stars!"}
{"text":"Butter fried chili burrito and green honey ice tea while Waiting for next flight!  Friendly not cheap.though"}
{"text":"Service was good. Place was clean. BUT the food was kinda bland and unseasoned."}
{"text":"After thinking about it for almost a year, I finally tried this place out! Truly great food (had the omelet and other signature stuff), friendly servers, and well, the waiting line was not that long - or perhaps I just made a right decision to go early in this regard."}
{"text":"Really great experience for myself, mom, sister-in-law and two year old niece.   Enjoyed the waiting area, cool bench, muriel and WATEr. Plenty of space for the niece to walk around and be entertained.   The interior was hustle and bustle. Friendly wait staff. The place is buzzing with energy.   Unfortunately the food just isn't that great. Everyone was happy and full but no one was impressed.   Unless we want a cool place to hang for breakfast, not likely to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"On a layover in the Phoenix airport I decided to stop at Matt's for a drink and quick bite to eat.  After grabbing a seat at the bar it took over 15 minutes for the bartender to address me and provide me with a menu.  After another 10 minutes I was able to order a drink, however, based on how long it took to just order a drink I decided to pass on food, as I was on a layover and needed time to make it to my next flight. I received my drink, which had no alcohol, so I addressed in with the waitress, who gave me an attitude.  After that it only went further downhill, leading me to ask for my check and leave.  I can only imagine working in an airpot restaurant may be tough, tired customers, rushed to get drinks and food, etc, but I was none of those.  I only ordered a drink and expressed a concern, especially for the price I was paying and received an attitude.  Definitely not the customer service experience I was hoping for.  I will definitely pass on Matt's next time I am in the Phoenix airport and visit another patron."}
{"text":"We ate here on the recommendation of a friend and I'm glad we did. Arriving early enough to beat the lunch rush, I was drawn to the Big Butter Burger.  It was a toss-up between that or the Cheese Omelet, but the burger's menu description won out. The BBB is half a pound of hand-pressed Niman Ranch ground chuck grilled in butter served with American cheese- yum!  The service was great and we had our food in no time. If you're expecting me to say that the burger was dripping in butter, it wasn't, but that's a good thing.  It was a tasty cheeseburger and I liked it!  The only drawback is that I wish it were served with fries; potato chips are what you get with this burger.  Other than that, I can truly say that I'd eat here again and look forward to trying a Big Breakfast next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Do I really want to add to the love-fest? Yes I do.  I've been here twice, and gotten in once (the wait got me the other visit). But now that I've made it inside, I can tell you that the wait is well worth it.  M had it as simple as you can get: A single egg, scrambled. And it was light, fluffy and perfect.  I had the Honey Lemonade and wish I could have it every day.   I also had the waffle & Bacon, both were amazing. The thick cut peppery bacon is soo good. I don't eat a lot of pork; so for me to love bacon, it's a big deal.  The waffle is the best I've ever had. the exterior is perfectly golden brown, and the inside is like eating a cloud. A tasty tasty cloud.  Wait it out, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Matt's is the best! We always love be the food no matter which location we go to and the Tempe Town Lake local is a great place to relax and take a walk after.   Would definitely recommend it here and we try to come often!"}
{"text":"First off, lemme just say that this review reflects neither on the quality of the food (fresh) or the service (excellent).  But seriously, I've had better.  Contrary to other reviewers, Guy Fieri is not the savant of Flavortown the Food Network makes him out to be.  Mom really wanted to try this place, particularly the \"Chop and Chick\" porkchop and eggs dish that Guy had on DDD here and the reason his face is tie-dyed sprayed on the wall with the words \"Guy Ate Here\".  We altered our exit strategy from the Armpit of America (aka Phoenix - 120 degrees at 8am, no sir!) just to sample this mythically delicious dish.  The parking lot is the size of a postage stamp, and while there are several sizable parking lots nearby, you can't park there because it's private property and Phoenix PD don't mess around.  Which leaves metered parking along the streets.  a quarter earns you 10 minutes at Matt's Big Breakfast, and the wait time is about fifty cents on a good day.  You sign your party up on the list near a ceramic pig by the door.  The restaurant itself is exceedingly small.  Get to know your neighbors, you'll definitely be talking to them at some point in your meal.  I had the organic chocolate milk which tasted exactly like the kind I have at home, an omelet with no special ingredients to set it apart from a Denny's omelet and Belgian waffles that weren't much better than the kind I buy frozen at Costco.  The menu at this Matt's location (I was told there are three around the Phoenix area, each with a more expansive menu than this location) is very limited and the ingredients are too.  No substituting fresh fruit, they don't have any.  That Chop and Chick that cost us $3.00 in metered parking?  I doubt Mom would have given it 2 stars.  Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience, but it wasn't something I'd do again."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here to start the day off. The food in here is very good. I had the skinny which consists of eggs with spinach and sausage with a side of salad. My girlfriend has the five sandwich having eggs, bacon and onions in it with toast. I loved the meal that we had. The place looks nice and gets packed quick so get there early."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in downtown Phoenix! Great atmosphere and service. You can tell everything is made from scratch. Their fresh squeezed orange juice and honey lemonade is delicious. I usually order the special and the griddle cakes to share with whoever I'm with. I recommend sharing to get the best of everything."}
{"text":"Updating my review. Been here twice since my last review and seems like they have stepped up their game and the kitchen is rock'n now.   No more cold food and fast service."}
{"text":"The best of the best. I eat here almost once a week - it's that good!  The OJ - fresh squeezed and always perfect. Wish it wasnt so expensive but you definitely get what you pay for.   I get the waffle everytime. It's literally the greatest waffle this side of the Mississippi (actually its the best one ive ever had but trying to sound slick LOL).   The butter - swear it has crack in it because you will want to put it on everything!!   And now the best part of Matt's (dont laugh!), the sourdough toast. Man ol' man!!!! I swear its better than any sourdough toast from san fran. Amazing!! I get two orders everytime."}
{"text":"Ok, so here's the deal. The griddlecakes here are delicious. And I mean good. Everything else is not so good.... I found that out this morning. So we waited for awhile and were seated in the back of the little room, not the one with the kitchen. The roof was leaking right next to us from the rain last night and it kind of smelled weird. Also, the service was not so good.... we asked for cream and never got it.... asked again.... finally got it. And this coffee needs it badly... so bad. And I'm still mad they stopped serving cream and started serving some fat free garbage. So anyway, I went with the BF for breakfast and he was getting the griddlecakes and I didn't want to get the same thing as him so I ordered the salami scramble. That thing was inedible. It had so much salami that was so fatty... the only thing I could taste was fat. Not pleasant. And the salami's texture was really chewy and weird too.... the home fries that come with it are good, the toast is not so great... came with blueberry preserves which was also not great. HOWEVER, go get the griddlecakes. They are awesome. I just can't say a place is four stars when only one thing is five stars and everything else is like 2. So there ya go. Go get some of delicious grandma's griddlecakes of awesomeness. Skip everything else.  Update: The BF and I went again today..... what a disappointment. His bacon was waaay too peppery.... like he didn't eat it, it was inedible. ugh. We waited over an hour and got seated at the counter.... pretty lame. Got the hotcakes...they were still good, but I just don't think I'll be back here anytime soon. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"I have had a love/hate relationship with Matt's, but in the past couple of months since they changed locations it has definitely been on the love side! I have gone to the new location a couple times and I think I have figured out the 'secret' to eating here. I live about 3 blocks away from Matt's so when I want to go I get up super early and arrive no later than 7:30. This generally ensures that I do not have to wait. Then, I order either the griddle cakes or the waffle, with the waffle being the better choice. The waffle is light, yet obviously bad for you because it tastes sooo good. Unlike the griddle cakes, the portion isn't crazy over the top and it comes with bacon which I like to tear into small pieces and put a piece in each of the little waffle pockets (or indentations or whatever those things are called). This plus the real maple syrup and butter is a sick....deliciously sick....combo. The griddle cakes are still awesome...like I said before, they taste like pancakes your grandma would make if your grandma was a really awesome cook. Also, the coffee no longer tastes like metal, it is, in fact, quite enjoyable. All in all, this place is good, especially when you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! I have been several times and you should expect a wait. They have several 2 person tables so if you have 4 or more people that wait just got worse. There food is natural and its so good...Its not too expensive either. The place is very small and parking is a problem."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, nice people fun  Atmosphere. Just crazy busy on the weekends"}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix and stumbled upon this gem on Yelp! It's located downtown but parking is not inconvenient at all; there is a small lot or metered street parking, which seemed ample even during the lunch rush. We arrived around 11:30 on a Friday afternoon. The restaurant was fully sat but no one was waiting in front of us. We had a party of 6 and I would recommend to try to keep your group small. This is a very quaint little space with limited room for large groups. It's only a one room restaurant. That being said, we waited about 25 minutes (which we were accurately quoted).  We sat down and were greeted promptly. Long story short, the service was friendly and the food was amazing.   Highlights:  -Iced coffee: I almost never order iced coffee in breakfast restaurants because it is almost always completely diluted by the melted ice. Here, they anticipate this and double-brew their iced coffee which leaves it tasting extremely bold (like a cold brew).   -Apple juice: seems like a weird thing to choose as a highlight, but it was so fresh and I believe cold-pressed!   -Strawberry honey lemonade. So refreshing in the heat.   -Chicken Apple sausage: just omg. Must try.   -Rosemary potatoes: life-changing. No one at the table could stop raving about them!   Also, the gentleman greeting and coordinating the seating was friendly and helpful. The owner also stopped by the table which I thought was a nice touch.   I would definitely recommend this place! You won't regret it. The menu is a little small but only because they take so much pride in the things they do serve."}
{"text":"What can I say about Matts, it's an awesome place. I've been here several times and also took my friends visiting from NYC and they're always spot on with food and service.   It can get crowded at times but never to long a wait."}
{"text":"This place was crazy packed at around 10:30am on a Tuesday. I honestly thought they had reinvented eggs and pancakes.  Everything was good I'm guessing the hype is over the breakfast meats which I don't eat. I have to say even as a pescetarian the bacon and sausage looked good. I wouldn't go back alone but I would definitely take some of my carnivore friends there. Staff was great and the place was very accommodating to children. Super pork-centric. If you eat pig, I would recommend you get yourself in there."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and I was amazed at how delicious everything was. I got the hog and eggs w bacon. The eggs were lightly fluffed w just the right amount of butter, the bacon was thick cut and they give you hearty portions. The strawberry honey lemonade was absolutely delicious and so was their Rubeun. I would definitely recommend this cute, hipster place!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I have ever been everyone is friendly and the food delicious.  The item on the menu is probably overlooked.  Sour dough toast it' tastes like someone just baked it and it comes with homemade strawberry jam."}
{"text":"I met a friend at Matt's Big Breakfast for Breakfast (of course!) on a Wednesday morning.  The menu is not too complex and offers staples of an American breakfast.  The real winner here is the jam to go with your toast.  The jam is what makes the breakfast!    Due to the location, parking can be a bit of an issue at times.  This place does get busy for breakfast too.  I give Matt's Big Breakfast 4 stars because of the jam!"}
{"text":"We went here today. I must say it was the best breakfast spot my family been too. I had the oats and it was delish. My husband had the special. It was the buttermilk biscuits and sausage gravy. It was absolutely incredible. And my kiddo got pancakes! The were fluffy and oh so good. Run don't walk here!! Great place!"}
{"text":"A little hard to find if you don't know what your looking for. Kitchen staff was super friendly when we walked in, all saying hi and welcoming. The front of the house staff didn't seem to care we were there. We were told to seat ourselves. There weren't many tables open so we sat at the bar. Our server quickly got us water and our drinks but after that we couldn't get her attention to order to get refills, at one point. We just asked whom ever we could for more coffee and water and even our check. It was a real disappointment, I had been looking forward to trying that place out for a while. The food was good but the menu is super limited. Everything we wanted were only specials on certain days which is weird because Eggs Benedict and French toast are usual breakfast teams. When we left we saw out server walking back with Starbucks, that explains why we couldn't get service haha! We're pretty laid back but when I have to go find my server so I can order there's a problem there. We won't be going back to Matt's Big Breakfast, there are so many options in the area that do it better and with better service. Which is too bad because that kitchen staff made a great first impression."}
{"text":"SO GOOD!!! Found this gem via Yelp and all the other great yelp reviews so my bf and I decided to check it out on a Saturday afternoon 3 weeks ago. There was a 20 minute wait for only bar seating, but the brunch was definitely worth the 20 minutes we waited!  I ordered the waffle (amazing, so tasty) with bacon and my bf ordered the pancakes with hash browns. Pancakes were good, but the waffle hit the spot - so I'd highly recommend getting the waffle."}
{"text":"This is it! I found it!  The one place that has the best bacon, the best hash browns, the best eggs, the best pancakes, the best maple syrup, the best toast, the best jam, and the best coffee all under one roof!!  I love Matts BB!  It has a local, relaxed vibe, the clientele is hip and  cool, and the staff is friendly and attentive.  There can be quite a long wait if you decide to go during peak weekend breakfast/brunch hours, but trust me, the wait is worth every minute.  When it comes to breakfast, I'm a pretty straight forward guy.  Bacon, eggs, potatoes and toast please.  And if I'm feelin' really hungry (and who are we kidding?  I'm always feelin' really hungry) i'll order a pancake for dessert.  Oh, and don't forget the coffee and OJ.   The bacon is unbelievably good; addictively good; sinfully good!  Thick, smokey, peppery, and mmmmmmmmmm, just perfect!  The hash browns are another masterpiece.  Crispy outside, tender and buttery inside.  The pancakes are delicious.  Light, fluffy, and and hot off the griddle; not dense and doughy like most diner pancakes.  You can taste the quality and freshness in every little detail.  The eggs, the toast, the jam, EVERYTHING!!  the decor is simple and unpretentious.  Just one big room with a bunch of tables, a bar that seats about 8 peeps, with a TV to watch Sunday morning football, (thanks for that, Matt!!), and a little side room that seats about 6-8 people in case you have a big group.  If you're ever in Phoenix, hungry, and looking for a down home place to have some down home grub with top notch quality, freshness and love for food, this is the place to be.  I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast foods, cooked with love and served in heaping amounts! We had a little trouble getting a table because there were 7 of us, but parties of 3-4 were getting seating rather fast. Totally acceptable, I understand it takes some time to get a table(s) for that many people. They were kind and courteous and kept us informed of when a table would be available. For as small a place this is, and as many people were there, it was managed very well. Servers were constantly walking around filling coffees and waters and our waitress was bilingual which helped my in-laws in ordering. I know it's a small thing but it really helped them out. I would be happy to come back here!   PS - the coffee is great!"}
{"text":"LOVE the food here at Big Matt's but the service at this particular location was terrible! Waited a good while for even someone to come by to take our drink order and once our food came out, our server(s) disappeared. At least the food was great!"}
{"text":"If you ever want great service to go along with the best food in the valley, then go here!! The breakfast is to die for, and the service tops the chart! I always have the daily morning special along with a side pancake. And believe me there is more than enough food here to satisfy my big appetite! The pancakes are out of the world with maple syrup!! I love Matt's and always highly recommended it to friends and love ones. You can't go wrong here!!!"}
{"text":"If there was any place in town that is worth getting up at 6am on a Saturday to get in line for breakfast food, this is it. Everything I've had here is amazing and worth the wait as everyone else said.   The ingredients are local, the staff is friendly and the setting compact. Not a place I would try to to bring a group larger than 4 to though so if you have a large group, pick out the 3 others you like the most and ditch the rest! ;)"}
{"text":"Everything was well worth the wait to get in.  The food was delicious and while a small menu a nice variety of items.  The homemade strawberry preserves were SO good I was eating them with a spoon once all my bread was gone."}
{"text":"Aside from the fantastic food, MBB has exceptional service. We are on vacation and Yelped to find good brunch spots. The reviews do not lie! MBB was easy to find for us \"out of towners\" and did not disappoint our tummies.   Only con is their very small parking lot, so we did have to pay to park on the street. Not a huge deal, as the meters do accept cards or coins.   I loved the Matt's Traditions menu found on the placemat. Today, their feature menu item was the biscuits and sausage gravy... talk about delicious! My boyfriend got the five spot and I would definitely order that on our next visit. Both meals exceptional as well as their friendly staff and service.   It's an epic five stars from this Hoosier!"}
{"text":"My second time here today and this place is really exactly what you want in an airport eatery- quick service with a smile. Sat at the bar both times and the bartenders have been attentive and welcoming.   Settled on the omelet last time and this time I went for the burrito sans the jalapeños...since I can be a wimp about that. It comes out looking delicious and tasting the same. It took only 8 minutes for my food to come out too- which is pretty awesome if you ask me. I walk over here from the A gates because I prefer this breakfast to others- it is this specialty after all. Check then out if uou're here in the AM."}
{"text":"What's there to say that hasn't already been said? Great, hearty food that sticks to the basics and very good service.   If there is a special of the day - get it. You wont regret it."}
{"text":"Small place, but a great breakfast. The waffle was perfect and the service was prompt. We went during the week, and the wait was about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place when she was visiting me in Phoenix because she heard about this place on food channel. It was on triple D's (Diners, Drive-in, Dives). We came here on a Sunday morning for a late brunch (around 1pm).  When we arrived there, it was street parking. We were able to find a place on the street. The place is very small, it reminds me of a very casual, good home-cooking restaurant - not fancy but just good food.  We put our name on the list outside. For a party of two, our wait was about 30-45 minutes. It was long but it didn't feel too long. It was a hot day so we waited in the shade. The hostess that sat us was very nice. We sat at the bar. My friend ordered the scramble special and I decided to order the Chop and Chick with wheat toast, hashbrowns and over easy eggs.  They served water in a little jars which I love. It's so cute and it reminds me of a simple, home-cooked. I looked around to see what everyone else was eating, it seems like couples like to split the food because the portions are big. Hence, the name \"Matt's Big Breakfast.\"  Service is quick. The waitress and waiters are attentive and they are constantly moving. The food came out in a decent time, it wasn't too long but not too quick.   When our food arrived, I almost thought they forgot my toast with my order. I asked them about it but they assured they did not forget me. My pork chop tasted like a pork chop I can make at home. I was a pan-fried pork chop that was oily and greasy. It wasn't seasoned too heavily, it wasn't too salty or peppery. The hashbrowns were very oily as well. I would like the hasbrown to be more crispy than oily. It was softer than I like. The wheat toast came with homemade strawberry jam. The strawberry jam was very sweet and had a strong strawberry aroma, I like the jam.   My breakfast was decent, it wasn't spectacular or horrible. It was a little more oily than I expected. It is your typical homecooked breakfast, they didn't mess up my order or anything."}
{"text":"We go to Matt's Big Breakfast everytime we are in Phoenix. We bring our volleyball team here every year or visit during spring training. As featured on DDD, the pork chops and hamburgers are the best!  Sometimes the son is working. We've watched him grow up. He is too cute! Friendly and efficient service; great food.  Went to Phoenix for Spring Training and discovered Matt's Big Breakfast located in the airport. Most of the favorite dishes are served in addition to more lunch and dinner entrees."}
{"text":"We were surprised to find Matt's Big Breakfast at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. We usually visit the downtown location when we travel to Phoenix, but ran out of time this trip.   Low and Behold, we got our fix at the airport. The menu is a little different than the restaurant. Caters to breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  The food is still great!"}
{"text":"Didn't love it. I tried it because of Food Network, but I did not have a good experience. My omelette was luke warm, and the potatoes greasy. It's very loud, and it is extremely obvious that they want you in and out asap. There was one guy racing around, yelling to people like he's had way too much caffeine. I really have no reason to go back."}
{"text":"Crowded! No wonder, the food is fantastic- perfect breakfast- the best fried eggs and bacon I've had in a while, the potatoes with rosemary were just perfect. Nice service too."}
{"text":"The food is decent. The coffee; not so good, pretty acidic. It's nice that they will give you honey to sweeten your coffee with, though. Also, I believe they only use butter and olive oil to cook with, which is A+"}
{"text":"Worth the wait!  Keep in mind there is always a wait.  They have a a water dispenser outside and benches while you wait.  I prefer to keep an eye out for the limited waiting area seating inside, though!!  While waiting, people forget the seats inside free up as those people are call to their tables.  Staff is very efficient, yet still personable to their customers.  On our last visit I loved how the hostess called me by name when she came by to check on my table.  And you don't just have one person checking up on you.  They all do!    Now, on to the food.  There is a reason why Matt's Big Breakfast is iconic here in Phoenix.  It's delicious!  The menu is simple and straight forward, but anything you order is phenomenal.  And although you've had a version of everything on the menu before, the way Matt's make it is so much better!  They also have specials so even if you visit more than a few times you can still try something a little different on each visit."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Very busy around the clock. Parking sucks, but it's Downtown Phoenix so what can you do? Service was great. Will be back."}
{"text":"Love this new breakfast option in Sky Harbor! Been there twice now (first time was late afternoon). The service at the bar was friendly and fast both times. Bacon Bloody Mary's adorned with cheese, pepperoncini and a thick slab of pepper bacon are a must! The waffle is light and fluffy and delicious. The omelette is big, cheesy & comes with mounds of home fries perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"Eggs are eggs, let's face it, but Matt does the other things very well. For starters, the home fries are phenomenal. This is how they should be done. The orange juice is squeezed there and it's very tasty. The toast is enormous and the jam they make there, which is great if you love strawberry. I didn't have the bacon, but it looked and smelled phenomenal. However, the real winner is the pancakes. They were really well done and probably the best I've ever had. They has a very unique taste I can only compare to the buttery taste of Ritz crackers. Putting the maple syrup on it was actually a travesty; do it without the syrup. Overall, great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for just a short bit on our way to Sedona and was looking for a breakfast place for our family of four. Matt's Big Breakfast came highly recommended on Yelp and we were not disappointed. Went on a Saturday morning around 9:30 and there was a short wait. Waitress was friendly and efficient and the food was delicious! Wish we lived in the area so I could go again!"}
{"text":"The food is good and worth it but this place is very UNACCOMMODATING for vegetarians. They refuse to do substitutions. They will gladly take something out but don't expect them to put something else in. Also we were seated in this weird room where they kept all their cold items... Our table was the only one in there and I had to physically move 5 separate times so a waiter could come and grab milk from the fridge."}
{"text":"On the weekend typical 30 min wait. Great omelettes, great waffles, great bacon, and hash browns. But....but... the restaurant always make you feel being rushed by the servers...they keep coming asking can I take your plate?????"}
{"text":"The Place:  After reading many of the hundreds of reviews talking about the size of Matt's, I was still surprised when I pulled up with my family and the restaurant was the building that looked like a small shed.  LOL.  Forget small, the place is micro.  It has a bit of an urban chic/diner-vibe, but there is nothing to the appearance that would make someone ooh and aah.  Our table was two tables for two, butted together with two chairs facing the window/wall, and the other two facing each other, an odd, but space saving layout.  We were in the first room where there is also a tall bar to sit and eat, however that bar is also part of the \"list\".  The Food: I ordered the Hog & Chick with scrambled eggs, bacon, wheat toast, and home fries.  The bacon was as good as most have commented, a little sweet, smokey, and peppery.  The wheat toast was thick-cut and super grainy and served with raspberry lavender jam, both super.  The eggs were fresh, but just scrambled eggs.  In my opinion the highlight of my dish was the home fries - these potatoes were cut into chunks and fried with fresh rosemary twigs and onions.  I thought I needed ketchup for them, not hardly.  My wife tried the pancakes and wasn't particularly impressed, nor was I when I tried a bite.  They were okay, just not amazing.  Since there is no kids menu (which is an oversight in my mind) my older daughter ordered the waffle.  It smelled great, and she polished it off before I could get a taste.  I thought it looked good - and she said it tasted great.  Nice touch is that both waffles and pancakes come with REAL & VERY HOT maple syrup.  My other monkey, er daughter, had the Hog & Chick as well, however she had the hashbrowns and country ham.  The ham was good, but salty like good ham should be.  The hashbrowns were REALLY soaked in oil/butter.  They were crispy on both sides, but whoa ... really soaked.  The Bottom Line: We got REALLY lucky in that we got there and were able to get seated within about 5 minutes.  This was around 8:30am on a Thursday, as soon as we were seated, the crowd showed up and there were at least 20 people milling around outside waiting to eat.  The parking stinks, micro lot behind the restaurant, and other than that it's metered parking.  $.60/hour is still cheap though.  I enjoyed the food and the experience was a little to crazy for my family of four with two squirmy kids.  I'm not a hater, but I'm not going to tell you it's the best breakfast I've ever had either.  The prices were fair, but again with a family of four with two small kids we tend to appreciate a place with a kid menu.  If it was only adults and we weren't so wiggly it might have been a different story.  I'm not sure I'm headed back there any time soon with my little wiggle worms.  That being said, you should try it and see what you think.  (big plus is that they took AMEX - one of the few small shops that do)"}
{"text":"The best hamburger in Phoenix is Matt's BIG BUTTER BURGER, bar none.  Get it cooked medium and get the HASH BROWNS on the side, we like them crispy or well-done.  The meat is so tender and flavorful, it melts in your mouth, and the bun is specially prepared just for them.  Super fresh produce on the burger along with a big ole slab of American cheese makes this a burger you'll dream about later on. The Griddle Cakes are our second-favorite item and when we go, we share a Burger and one order of the Cakes and we are both FULL and satisfied.   Matt's is truly a hole-in-the-wall, but don't let that deter you.  Figure out when the lines are short and GO, you won't regret it. WE LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this week.  I don't stand in line for eggs, so went for lunch.  REALLY good chili.  There wasn't a wait at lunch time mid week.  It's noisy, so it's best for a casual, catching up with friends lunch- not for 'business'.  I would go again."}
{"text":"Meh.  I don't get the stellar reviews.  It's fine, but it's loud and there is almost always a wait for some reason.  It's overpriced for breakfast food.  The food is fine, but I wouldn't say fabulous.  The staff is always in a rush.  For me, the noisy environment and the price keep me from going back."}
{"text":"I was really pleased with breakfast here! What's great about Matt's is they do all the basics right. EVERYTHING is flavorful and delicious, down to toast. It's evident REAL, and FRESH ingredients are used. It's when you can get the basics right and genuinely delicious is when you have a gem on your hands. Matt's, open one is the Sierra Vista area!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten anything here yet (still at the table), but they don't have espresso so they top out at 3 stars. Breakfast place without breakfast drinks makes everyone sad."}
{"text":"we sat at the bar this morning while waiting for a flight and the bartender was phenomenal.   The food was okay. But as a frequent guest at the other Matt's locations I was disappointed with the quality of the food.   It just really isn't the same.   But better than eating at McDonald's so there's that."}
{"text":"Excellent attentive servers. Timely service (food to table time) less than 10 minutes. Freshly squeezed OJ is truly freshly squeezed!   Don't miss out on their daily specials - check the placemat under your menu!"}
{"text":"Not much more really needs to be said for Matt's. The wait seemed intimidating but they have it down to system and it was hardly a wait.  Food was fresh and delicious and we all enjoyed our meals. I ordered the pancakes and they are everything you hope a pancake would be."}
{"text":"Server was nice...had heard about this place from hotel. Excited to try it. Long story short...paid 20.00 plus including tip for Pancakes, bacon, and juice. Pancakes were big...3 of them...given about 1 oz of syrup...requested more...they charge 1.50 for extra syrup. Asked for coffee with cream or half and half...they don't have it, just milk. OJ was 4.50 for 12 oz. They do use maple syrup, but honestly it tasted like any other pancake syrup. Pancakes were dry as I really didn't want to pay extra. This is the first review I have ever written...downloaded yelp today. I feel this strongly about reviewing this place. Very disappointed. I feel like price wise they are like an expensive steak house where you are nickel and dimed to death. Not at all worth it. Just my humble opinion. Sorry, not usually one to complain..."}
{"text":"*burp* You know you have to put the guilt aside when it's lunch with your girlfriends.  More so when Dottsy suggested Matt's.   It was my first time, I remember it like it was yesterday.  Or, a half hour ago. Sign-in at the door to wait to be seated.  Gorgeous day out, so no big deal.  I took a seat on the bench outside and waited for Dottsy.  Then a lady sat at the other end of the bench and my side flipped up.   I had heard it was small...but not *this* small!  It was really cute and the staff was super-friendly.  I had to pee, though.  Apparently, the bathroom was off the kitchen.  OK.  I hope to myself as I make my way past the grills that I am not posing a health hazard to Matt's.  I mean, I was wearing a baseball cap, but no net!  Bathroom was tiny with no mirror.  That was ok for me, because, as I stated, it was baseball cap day.  The bathroom and its location are the only reason I took a star off. I got the cheddar and mushroom omelet.  Came with a side of hash browns and toast.  With a little cup of jelly.  At first, I didn't know it was jelly...until Dottsy saw a man put his little cup-o-stuff on his toast.  Omelet was huge, as was the hash brown.  The omelet was stuffed.  STUFFED with cheese and mushrooms.  I could see the butter on the plate.  Oh, man, this was gonna ROCK!  The hash brown was made from spaghetti-cut potatoes. Mmmmmmmmmmmyummy! I ate it all.  Everything.  I mean, I waited a half hour to be seated.  And my 20-year High School reunion isn't until July.  So, that's ok that I cleaned off my plate.  Right?  RIGHT???? Oh, and I ran into Dallas there.  Always a plus!"}
{"text":"This is the first breakfast place I tried when I moved from Indiana to Arizona in May 2010. It is fantastic!   OK, let me get the \"negatives\" out of the way:   1. Small Place, (possible) Long Waits  - Most people are impatient, no matter how good the food. If you are one of those people and want to eat here; get here BEFORE the doors open.   2. OK, can't think of any more.   All the Positives:   1. Yes it is small, but it has a wonderful old-school diner feel.  2. The wait staff is friendly and attentive.  3. The food is worth the wait!   On my trip to Matt's I had:   1. Honey Lemonade (not as sweet as you might fear - very tasty)  2. The Hog and Chick  (Two eggs and choice of off-the-bone ham, thick-cut bacon, or country sausage - I went with the bacon)   The eggs were perfect; I always ask for over medium and rarely does a place get the consistency right (Matt's did).   The thick-cut bacon was always cooked to my specification - not too crispy; I still like a little chew to it.   Since I got there at/before they opened, I was in right away, got my food, enjoyed it, and was out in about 30 mins.   A small place, with great service, great food, and a loyal following. I can see why!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast. There was about a 15 minute wait but the meal was not disappointing. The bacon is sooooo effin good but the breakfast sausage is kinda bland. The staff is nice and it seems like they all work together to get stuff done. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I went by myself and waited an hour and a half on a Thursday morning. The hostess was rude, after a mix up when she called me (the name she called before me didn't come so she went to seat me, but then realized that she said the name wrong so I waited ten more minutes and then she called tables who were after me), she told me \"oh there's a table inside in the corner you can go now\". I felt super rushed and that I was inconveniencing the restaurant. The waiter I had seemed not all there. The food was ok but definitely not worth the hype and price."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast. This place is always busy! Def try their homemade bread and jam!!"}
{"text":"I'm a breakfast guy. I love breakfast. Like a lot. This place was worth the wait, fresh flavorful food served by a friendly crew. I had the special which was a scramble and fully satisfied me but the piece de resistance was the waffle. Most waffles are good, there's an expectation that gets met, but this was hands down the best waffle I've had! A unique flaky texture with real butter and maple syrup. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Very delicious food! Very quaint atmosphere!  Super busy, so prepare to wait at least 30 minutes."}
{"text":"because of the Guy Fieri review, my husband and I went there for breakfast (duh).  The lauded/drooled upon pork chop on Triple D was dry and very thin.  The breakfast was honestly nothing all that special. I prefer the meal at either Eggstacy or First Watch"}
{"text":"We actually preferred eating here b/f our flight to kick off our vacation!  The original downtown one wasn't near as positive an experience as this one turned out to be!  Service was the best, food was excellent and even though everyone is there waiting for a plane-we weren't rushed and they made us feel valued!"}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with breakfast take-out here a few weekends ago and I was a giggling mess. I had the perma-grin waiting for him to get back with my favorite item, the Salami Scramble. It is scrambled eggs mixed with sliced salami, with their awesome thick toast and your choice of hashbrowns or home fries. The jelly they give with the toast is delicious, as well. I can't say I am a huge fan of the potatoes as both the home fries and hashbrowns tend to be really greasy. That's okay, though, because the rest of the food is great. They also have thick-cut bacon you can order on the side that is pretty wonderful. I have eaten in the restaurant, sometimes, and I never had to wait too long and usually the wait seems to go by fast. Inside, the service is pretty efficient which at times can seem like they are pushing you out. But everyone is really friendly. I love that the farmer's market is right across the street which is great if you want to get out and have a nice breakfast before hitting the market. Matt's is closed on Mondays, FYI. Don't be like me trying to hit it up on a Monday off and throwing the collossal temper-tamptrum in the parking lot."}
{"text":"What hasn't been said about Matt's???  It's great food and the folks that work there are as friendly as they can be.  Get there early or you'll wait.  Every time I bring the two year old with me the staff goes out their way to take care of this Daddy on a date with his daughter.  Hog and Chick is the staple and the hash brown taste like they've been cooked in a pound of butter.  Be still my beating heart... Eat any more and we'll see that.  The Missus had the pancakes and they were also great.  Fresh ingredients abound and you syrup isn't flavored corn syrup.  Real maple syrup!!!  A true Phoenix landmark and place to eat"}
{"text":"Bacon O' Bacon!!! This place was one of those random \"let's see what's good in this area\" excursions. WOW. I was excited by the reviews and the fact that it was featured on DDD (secret foodie mission of mine is to try EVERYTHING on DDD). Well, it was worth the wait and had the best bacon I have ever tried! They were quick and attentive once inside. HOWEVER, I did wait for over an HOUR on a half broken milk crate I turned up-side down, outside in the JULY 100+ degree weather. They had one bench that seated four with some shade and the rest were out in the open. They do have a crowd and I understand a wait for good food but, it was uncomfortable. They also have an honor system scratch pad under a paper weight, that is barely monitored and I saw a few people try to sneak their names on! Thankfully, people who are hungry are ruthless and they didn't get very far! A hostess would help IMMENSELY or a police officer in case a fight breaks out ;)...   OVER ALL- once I was inside, it was a good experience, fresh food, cozy atmosphere and great service!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while waiting for a connecting flight. Absolutely awesome cheeseburger. One of the best I've ever had. Not something you'd expect at an airport. Service was great too."}
{"text":"After hearing such glowing reviews, my boyfriend and I got up super early to be there when Matt's opens. We were underwhelmed. The service was fine. The ambiance was fine too. We just didn't think it was anything special. For a place called Matt's Big Breakfast, I didn't think the breakfasts were very big, and neither were the options. It wasn't bad-it just wasn't great."}
{"text":"It was alright. The food was really good, but the portions were pretty small. There are only seven or so options in the entire menu. The bacon was amazing, so definitely get something with that. No avocado or tobasco sauce unfortunately. The hash browns have a lot of butter, so they actually taste more like mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Delicious food great quick service of locally and organically sourced ingredients...   They get me, i want amazing food fast at the airport!!!"}
{"text":"Wanted the check you what all the hype was about at this place.  Was very disappointed about the breakfast not to mention the price.  It was outrageous for two people's breakfast.  We waited in line for at least 30 minutes only to be disappointed with the food and especially the price.  Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Eh....Guy Fieri can keep it.  The good:  strawberry preserves are amazingly good, sourdough toast thick and well-buttered, good coffee with real cream, and hash browns fried in butter.  The wait wasn't too terrible for a Sunday morning after church.  My daughter's pancakes were fluffy and good.  Now for the not so great:  burned bacon, burned hash browns, dry overcooked pork chops, and my scramble was watery because they didn't saute the jalapeños first to  get the water out of them.  When I'm paying $100 (including tip) for breakfast for 6 people, I expect a higher level of cooking skill than I can achieve in my own kitchen.  We weren't coming back anyway, but the noise level added to everything else guarantees it.  They are very big on fresh, local, and cruelty free ingredient sourcing, which is fine, but I think you pay for that gimmick much more than the cooking skill."}
{"text":"The best comfort food I've had in some time. MBB nails it! Everything I ordered was prepared just the way I like it. I think I've just found my new favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"Pretty good food! Quick service and clean bathrooms. Most of the servers were wearing \"MBB\" tee shirts and jeans, but I was extremely distracted by the server who thought it was cool to wear a tiny racerback t-shirt dress with her bra and breasts hanging out. Did not fit the venue at all, and you could see several other customers noticing her outfit. Other than being annoyingly distracted by that, it was good."}
{"text":"Second time I've been the Matt's while traveling and will return again, service staff are absolutely the best, try the grilled cheese and tomato soup and all of the hamburgers are great"}
{"text":"I'm an avid food network watcher, and heard about this little breakfast joint from both Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and Phoenix Magazine's \"Best Of\" issue. I'd actually tried it once before last summer and been only mildly impressed...To read about the experience that changed my mind, visit my food blog:  http://eatinganddrinkingacrosstheusa.blogspot.com/2011/07/downtown-phoenix-az.html"}
{"text":"Good food great people and atmosphere Really enjoyed the staff very accommodating highly Reccomend...."}
{"text":"If you are a breakfast place, than learn how to make an omelette !  Mine was dry, like-warm, flat, dense and not presented well either! Also: no cream for coffee! Do you know what that does to coffee?  Disappointing - for the price you charge, you should do much better !"}
{"text":"I went to Matt's Big Breakfast with my wife on 08/15/14. We were staying at the Westin and a front desk employee had recommended Matt's to us. The reviews on YELP were great and it's only a short walk away, in the hot Phoenix sun, so we thought we'd check it out. When we walked in we were promptly greeted and seated ourselves at a table for two. There are tables and a breakfast bar to eat at. The restaurant was busy but not crowded. I can imagine that people are waiting in line to eat at Matt's on weekends. Our waiter and waitress, yes, we had several people take care of us, quickly took our order. Great team work! I had the Hog and Chick, with an extra egg and bacon. My wife had a waffle with a side of bacon. My meal came with home fries and toast, I also ordered a freshly squeezed OJ and we both had coffee. The coffee was good and refills were plentiful. The OJ was freshly squeezed and delicious. The service continued to be great and our meals came out in a timely manner. I had ordered my eggs over easy because I like my eggs runny. Two eggs were cooked perfectly but one had no runny yolk. My home fries were cooked with onions and rosemary and were piping hot. My toast was only one slice of wheat but was very thick and easily compared to two slices of regular wheat toast. The star of the show, for me, was the bacon. It was two of the best slices of tender, thick cut bacon I have ever had, at a breakfast place. My wife told me that her waffle was really good and agreed with me on how good the bacon was. Matt's Big Breakfast did not disappoint. If your visiting the area or just dumping your kid off at ASU, definitely head to Matt's Big Breakfast."}
{"text":"Little restaurant, big flavor. We waited for about 30 minutes to get seated on a Sunday morning. Honestly, it was worth it. Plus, their freshly made lemonades are so good."}
{"text":"Have eaten here three times and each time it's been great! Food is fresh, tastes great, good coffee, great service.  Try the Belgian waffle you will love it! The owner makes his rounds regularly. Matts and St Francis are my fav Sunday brunch spots!!!"}
{"text":"Ooh, I can help push Matt's to past 100 reviews!   Before, I only got stuff by takeout because the wait was just too much. This morning, decided to just suck it up. The fact that the downtown farmer's market is right across the street helps. I recommend signing the wait list before you're actually hungry and go check out all the local vendors.  I previously had the hog and chick with \"off-the-bone ham.\" Mmmm....the ham is always flavorful and just the right amount of tender. I love how the toast is actually hunks of sourdough or wheat rolls with jam that's not a little Smuckers packet. Back to what I ate this trip, I finally had their Belgian style waffle. It was bordering on perfect--crispy in all the right places and steaming and soft inside. I love how they serve the syrup warm. The bacon was thick but not too dense. And the freshly squeezed orange juice of course complemented it all. Hard to believe that they don't add any sugar to the juice. I like how the hash browns aren't greasy like what you'd get at IHOP or Denny's.   The staff are quite friendly and make sure you've been attended to. The atmosphere in the little red brick house is a jovial neighborhood diner feel. Our wait was not quite half an hour but that's after we returned from the farmer's market to check on our wait. Time it all before you're actually starving and you'll be good."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast food, and my new go-to lunch spot on weekdays. Everything is freshly made and locally sourced, and it shows in the flavors delivered. I especially recommend the airy griddlecakes and delicious toast with their home made strawberry preserve. Can't recommend this place enough for the quality of food, and the friendly service and reasonable prices just enhance the experience."}
{"text":"I almost like this better than the downtown location just based on size alone. But both locations tend to execute quickly and provide tasty food. They also have the best bacon, most deliciously seasoned potatoes, and garagantuously trimmed $14 bacon Bloody Mary's (for airport food, I'll take it). Their sourdough toast with housemade jam is also not to be missed.  Worth the treck to the B gates if you have the time before takeoff."}
{"text":"So this place was such a let down. With all the hype I expected amazing, one of a kind eats. Instead, I got any other breakfast joint that made good food. I definitely wouldn't pay for parking and wait more than 20 minutes for their food.  You're better off driving to Arcadia area where thwy have several restaurants with the same kind of ambience, price, bigger portiins and free parking. Also, if you're a breakfast place in AZ that serves eggs and don't carry Chaloula that's just blasphemy. The service was good, their definitely quick. Although, they forgot our sausages by the time it came out we were done with everything else. But that happens sometimes, I'm sure they were just busy. The decor is cute."}
{"text":"Let me just say that this wasn't my first taste of Matt's. I've enjoyed some of this deliciousness at the Sky Harbor location, but this spot has a much better vibe and the same great food! I love that they use locally roasted coffee (Cave Creek) and everything tastes so fresh. I went in this morning and thoroughly enjoyed the special for today which was biscuits and gravy. It was more like: perfectly flakey biscuit smothered in chunks of sauces with just enough gravy. Someomes this combo can be runny, mushy, taste too fried, or be far too heavy. This dish was none of those. Instead, it's everything you want it to be. Tasty, great texture, and a little spicy. So good!"}
{"text":"The hash browns were good; inside of them were soft, and the outside crispy. Unfortunately the employees were just as crispy.  They had an edge on them, sharper than the knife I used to cut the sausage patties I ordered. Our waitress gave me anxiety- I literally took my clonazepam at the restaurant. She talked to us super quietly, at about 1,000 mph. The specials? Couldn't tell you because we don't know what the hell she said. So we ate fast, drank our strawberry lemonade  (that was regular lemonade with red dye... I don't know either) and took our check to the front.  The girl at the front had a cute sweater on, but her math skills weren't that cute. We asked her to split the bill but she said \"you need to do your own math.\" Uh okay. So we pull out our calculators and figure it out,  then tell the girl with the cute sweater how to charge us. Good thing we all have iPhones; I don't know what the poor girl would've done if we didn't figure it out. We dodged the hoard of homies blocking the front door and safely made it to the car (granted, we had front row parking)!  We left full, but confused and a little traumatized."}
{"text":"Omelette and hash browns were alright. I'm not to big on omelettes though. Orange juice was fresh, mmm!!"}
{"text":"I love this place - it's cozy, clean, and very well designed. The staff is all very friendly, the food choices are good, and everything comes out relatively quickly. Everything you'd want from a diner.  That's really all I have to say. Go here."}
{"text":"First tried this lovely little breakfast joint about two years, and have been dying to come back! It usually ends up that I'm in a different part of town or in the neighborhood after Matt's is closed. Absolutely delicious breakfasts! And huge! In a nicely decorated downtown space! The service is on the ball - but you almost feel a little hurried. Still, an undeniably fantastic breakfast! I would rank Matt's in my Top 5 Breakfasts of All Time (yes, I am that serious about breakfast)."}
{"text":"Long wait, but very good food! All four of my group got different things and loved their breakfast! Plus, they have RC Cola, instead of.......ya know!...."}
{"text":"Don't buy the hype. I love a good breakfast, but that's not what I got here. I had an omelet with ham, mushrooms, and provolone cheese. The omelet was sub standard. The ham was like sliced deli ham very thin. Not at all like the chunks of ham I envisioned. The mushrooms tasted like they came from a can. As for the potatoes, they came overseasoned. So much so that i left more than half on the plate. The only redeeming thing for this breakfast was the toast and jam. The jam was delicious and tasted homemade. Overall though it was an overpriced meal and a mediocre experience. The service was decent and they made sure my coffee was never empty."}
{"text":"sweet baby jesus this place is amazing. We have been on a yelp kick lately and after a heavy night of drinking we decided to do breakfast in the morning. After a short early drive we arrived and were greeted by the most friendly staff I have ever encountered, mixed with a smell straight from heaven. we sat down, and ordered the special which was a egg scramble, the hog and chick, and two waffles. the coffee was amazing, the orange juice was omg, and the service was so fast and friendly. We took one bite of our food and it seemed like a whirlwind. the food is so good that you are in and out of there before you know it. if you go anywhere for breakfast it needs to be here."}
{"text":"Ambience: B- Cleanliness: B+ Customer Service: C Food: B-  Price  -Its an airport, its expensive, end of story. The prices were very inflated but I have seen worse so there is that.    Atmosphere -Again, its an airport. They try to make it look like an old fashion diner, they fail, but it still beats eating Doritos at your gate.   Customer Service  -Its an airport, people are not trying to be there all day. Now I'm not saying the wait staff should put on running sneakers but at least be efficient and by efficient I mean don't be on your phone in view on costumers for several minutes while people are trying to flag you down. On that note, don't look down on your phone while taking someones order and then get annoyed with them when you bring out the wrong order. Unless you were texting the chef, I'm pretty sure it was your lack of listening skills to blame on that one.   Food  It was edible. Again, it beats a $6 bag of Doritos. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad, but it served its purpose in that starve to death at the airport.   Overall I don't think I've ever had a great experience eating at the airport and this was no different. Usually I get decent costumer service though, so that sort of added insult to injury in this case. If you are going to robe me blind by inflating your prices, at lest do so with a smile on your face."}
{"text":"So good!  You will wait to get in, but you'll want to spend at least as much time savoring each bite of your meal.  Everything's super fresh, the coffee tastes great, the staff's super quick and friendly.  What more can I say!    I ordered the Belgian Waffle on a whim and it was light, sweet and perfectly filling.  I totally missed the specials on the board, but I'm using that as an excuse to get back in there for another breakfast--like, really soon!"}
{"text":"Oh, my god!!  No, I've never experienced breakfast nirvana before, but I know it when I feel it.  Thursdays are Eggs Benedict days.  GO there.  Eat it.  I have never loved this dish before and now may never love it again having sampled Matt's oeuvre.  My countermate recommended the bacon highly.  While bacon with EB is overkill, I must say that, having ordered it, I was entirely satisfied.  It was firm, thick and peppery - Bacon so good that I will be hunting for slab bacon to hand slice and pepper to copy it.  To top this slavishly positive review, even the coffee was excellent.  Though my bill for breakfast was nearly $20, I didn't feel cheated in the least.  It was splendid.  Oh, and did I mention the home fries...?"}
{"text":"I disliked the food and the service, food was cold and we weren't seated probably. The service was subpar from other breakfast joints in the area and took a very long time to get served. My partner on the other hand enjoyed his meal and thought they did and okay job.  As is any review, they are totally subjective to each individual go there and see for yourself."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what Moar O. is talking about. Their waffle is NOT standard stuff you could get at any hotel. I had two friends visit me from out of town, so I took them here. They loved the waffle and bacon so much that they insisted we come back again two days later. What I like to do is go here with someone who likes to share. One person orders the special for the day (usually an omelet of some sort with side of home fries) and I order the waffle and bacon and we split them both. Otherwise, if you eat the waffle by yourself, you will die (or just feel really sick because of all the butter and syrupy deliciousness).  Also, servers and other staff are always VERY friendly. Waiting is a drag, but it's to be expected so you just deal with it."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, we went back two days in a row it was that great. Spring Training and great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Worth the Triple D hype. We always stop here when we drive cross country. I think we've been here 4 times, total. They have moved into a larger building and their competition around the corner puts a sign up across the street to lure the hungry waiting patrons away from Matt's. Nice tactic, but I will say this place is worth the wait. Everything is fresh, real, homemade-- doesn't get better. I always get the pancakes, the Chop and Chick is good too.. Their home fries and coffee are great.. Fresh preserves on fresh bread. Just go to there. It's great."}
{"text":"Breakfast for dinner!  Awesome waffles, Bacon really peppery. I love it. Good bar too."}
{"text":"Had a chance to check it out ..was very busy inside and there was a wait., but the food was good even with a limited menu. Id go again if im close by"}
{"text":"The food was ok. However the waitress Erika was very rude. After being ignored by the hostess, I finally sat at the counter. Then I was ignored by the waitress Erika at the bar. She seem not to ignore the people beside me. Once I said excuse me can I order? she acted like I was bothering her for asking. When i finally got my order the other waitress threw my meal to go on the counter and said Erika will get you your ketchup.  No thank you, no have a nice day. I travel a lot for a living, especially to Phoenix, but I promise I will never go to this restaurant as long is this is the type of service they provide.  If you get hungry, I would suggest you eat somewhere else. No food is good enough to put up with bad service. I did tip her, because I truly believe in tipping your server, even if the service is not up to mediocre standards."}
{"text":"Bring your appetite!  ASU students nearby have a great hangout and breakfast spot.  Food and service at Matt's was great.  They even have complimentary water with orange slices out front if you have to wait a little bit and it sure was hot in Phoenix!   I'll definitely be back for another go and thank you for a nice experience while just visiting."}
{"text":"We make this a destination for our family as much as we can! The waffles are superb! And the omelets come the size of your face! And you wish you could have more (despite your overstuffed stomach)."}
{"text":"It's Saturday so finding parking is incredibly difficult. We arrived at 11:10, did not get a table for 2 until 12:05. You cannot grab seats at the breakfast bar when available, you have to be wait listed for that too. The restaurant is freezing with metal chairs, I presume to turn over tables faster.        We ordered a glass of milk, the strawberry honey lemonade and OJ. The lemonade was heavenly, and the OJ was best. The food and drink is strictly why they got 3 stars at all. I ordered their BLT. Joe ordered the Belgian waffle, a side of hash browns and bacon. We placed our order at 12:10, didn't get our food until 12:36.  The bacon was great, the Belgian waffle was the prefect amount of sweet. Thought we should try out new restaurants since we're in a food desert in Laveen haha. Will not be returning here though, sticking with our favorite Morning Squeeze in Scottsdale or Kiss the Cook in Glendale when permissible."}
{"text":"Delicious food! It was kind of noisy though."}
{"text":"Even though they have moved to a bigger building... Like literally down the street, the wait is still long. Hence why I give them 4 stars.   When it comes to ordering food though, I go for the special when they do their scramble. It's my fav! It'll usually be some kind of meat and cheese scramble that comes with your choice of potato (hash brown or home fries) and a tortilla. Their strawberry honey lemonade is delicious as well!!!"}
{"text":"Don't be turned off by the location and size. Good things come in small packages."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I have ever encountered. I went in there with my family for lunch. When I got there, they told me a 4 minute wait then they came back and said 6 minute wait and then they said they could not give me a table as my family was not there. My wife was parking the car. I felt they were racist because I was Asian. I will never go there and will never suggest anyone to go there. Very rude and unpleasant staff"}
{"text":"Had lunch there. My wife thought the club was great.  I had the Ruben.  No taste to the sauerkraut and the 1000 dressing was very runny and not very good.  If we go back maybe We'll stick to breakfast.  Went to the one on Rio Saladin.  Parking is a nightmare to say that least"}
{"text":"\"Guy [Fieri] isn't usually a breakfast fan but he'll stop by Matt's Big Breakfast anytime of day.\" ? FoodNetwork.com  I'm not a breakfast fan either but I wouldn't say I'd stop by Matt's Big Breakfast anytime of the day.  Then again, it's not like I have a show on the Food Network so here are some words on a screen.  The three of us stopped by after our spin class at Cyclebar.  We were sweaty, hungry, and feeling good after our post-cycle mimosas.  Aw yis!  Run me a bath filled with hollandaise sauce while I devour perfectly poached eggs on golden toasted English muffins while I laugh maniacally over nothing!  Too bad this didn't happen as they do not serve Eggs Benedict on Sundays.  What!?  Sunday is for brunch and Eggs Benedict is the undisputed king of all brunch foods!  My heart broke.  The second heartbreak came shortly after when I was given my can of beer with a freshly-washed HOT glass.  Rapidly warming beer, anyone?  Blegh!  So since the Matt's Tradition, also known as the daily special, said Eggs Benedict was served on a weekday instead, I ordered the Sunday special of Steak and Eggs.  I had ordered my steak medium rare but was given a medium cooked steak.  Where's the ruby red center!?  Lame.  On the side was beautiful over-easy eggs that bled its gorgeous yolks all over my plate with the slightest prick of my knife.  The hashbrowns were super crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.  All it needed was a little ketchup and some Tapitio [no Tabasco or Cholula here, folks] and they were delish.  I ordered rye bread at no extra cost and they were cut thick, smeared with butter, and layered with housemade preserves.  It was like dessert.  Yum!  All in all, it's a solid breakfast place that is easily rated at 3.5 stars.  But still, it's just breakfast --- a locally sourced and organic breakfast but it's just eggs and meat, y'all!  I would come back but maybe not when I'm super hungry because that hour wait is not cute."}
{"text":"My previous experience was very pleasant but today I changed my mind. I sat at the bar solo, one waiter takes my drink order then disappears. Another waitress takes my food order then disappears. A different waitress comes to me and asks how the food was. That's messed up. Who should I tip? And besides that, their attitudes (all of them) are careless and distracted. I didn't even dare to approach the issue that my pork chop steak was tough and insipid. Not only the steak but also the scramble eggs were flavorless, hash browns so oily... I truly exclusively enjoyed the sourdough bread with the handmade jelly and the orange juice. That's why I give 2 stars instead of 1. I read the story on the back of the menu of how proud the owner is to feature quality of food and organic, local-grown products and bla bla bla. But where's the quality? I'm a foodie, I want to eat well. What you gave me this morning was very ordinary, at best. There's a lot of competition in this town due to the fact that there are so many breakfast places. You must give your customers something that will make them come back to you. Otherwise, from now on, big red cross on Matt's Big Breakfast."}
{"text":"I finally made the great Breakfast pilgrimage.  It was worth every minute of the wait.  We put in our names, and walked over to the downtown market to kill some time.  We still had to wait about 15 minutes after that, but it was a great way to go.  Highly suggest it.    The best pancakes I've ever had.  Ever.  And the home fries?  I could eat just a big bowl of that and be happy.  Great rosemary taste.  Really loved the coffee. Yummy peppery bacon.  One of our companions said the ham was the best she'd had since she's lived in Tennessee more than 15 years ago.    Right before we left, we saw someone served a hamburger and we could hardly move.  It was the best looking burger I've ever seen.  We will TOTALLY be back just for lunch. Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmmm...    But Matt himself cracking jokes with the patrons and chatting with downtown neighbors walking by was awesome.  While the food felt made with love, the big guy's personality totally put it over the top. You love supporting him supporting downtown.  Its the kind of business you would almost like to go even if it wasn't that good.  But thank goodness - it is that good.  Can't wait to go back.    Very.  Very.  Soon."}
{"text":"waited for a really long time . . . like an hour and a half.  To be honest - it wasn't all that and a bag of chips like I expected.  I mean, it was good, but I was expecting to get blown away and I didn't.  The breakfast wasn't even that big.  I had the special and I can't even remember what it was that's how unimpressed it was. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Food here is solid - simple breakfast fare for reasonable prices.  I'm a fan of the Five Spot, which is a tasty breakfast sandwich in a restaurant setting for a similar price to what you would expect to pay at McDonalds.  The reason why I'm giving 3 stars here is service.  The service was about what I would expect to receive at McDonalds.  Actually, McDonalds generally treats me better, so I shouldn't bash Mickey D's.  I asked if there was an alcohol menu (hey, I was there with a bunch of nightshifters hoping to have a pleasant bloody mary with my eggs before going to sleep for the day) and got raised eyebrows, a stare, and a short \"no.\"  Our group also received an abrasive \"we don't do individual checks\" from our waitress as she handed over the check - despite the fact that we hadn't asked for individual checks.  Not a \"hey, did you have a good meal, is there anything else we can help you with?\"  No smile.  If a meal is truly extraordinary I'll excuse a bit of rough attitude (ex: most french restaurants).  Matt's Big Breakfast is good, but it isn't unique enough out of all the great valley breakfast options to make me put up with the attitude."}
{"text":"I stumbled into Matt's Big Breakfast after a difficult overnight shift with the rest of my night team and immediately devoured a meal.  This place serves the perfect post-shift breakfast, which means that it also probably serves the perfect post-binge hangover food too.  Coffee is diner-style, with frequent visits from friendly waiters bearing big pots of coffee, and the Five Spot consists of a perfect-sized breakfast sandwich with thick-cut bacon and delicious eggs.  Even better, the price for that sandwich is equivalent to one from most fast-food restaurants.  You may have to wait a little bit for a brunch table on the weekends, but that only attests to the quality of the food.  Matt's Big Breakfast makes me look forward to overnight shifts.  That's one of the highest recommendations I can give."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum, with extra yum!  Oh did mention yum!?  This place rocks!  They are well known for the specials which change daily. So I did the three eggs scrambled with southwest chicken sausage, and fresh jalapeño which was excellent. My wife did the Griddle cakes which was awesome!  They might have been the best cakes I've ever had due to the freshness. We will be eating here all week!  The only knock is the noise levels might get a tad high."}
{"text":"What a cute place.  Believe me, the place is small but the breakfast is big.     It is a tiny dwelling and I can't imagine the wait time during their peak business hour but talk about helping the little guy out and everyone there was pleasant and most importantly the food was great.  I want to try everything there when I return.  BTW, they had the best tasting hash browns I've ever had.... Thinly sliced and well done.....Just the way I ordered it."}
{"text":"I can only give this two stars at the airport I love Matts in downtown  But this one lacks the good food and is in jeopardy of being typical vs special  Ordered the bourbon chicken and it was bone dry and tough to cut  Wait staff didn't seem to care  Coleslaw wasn't the same no flavor which they tried to compensate for with pepper I rather walk down to cowboy ciao which is another speciality that so far is holding up to standards"}
{"text":"Their breakfast food quality has definitely gone down over the past 3 years of eating here. I used to be obsessed w the home fries because they used to be so soft and delicious, but now they are pretty much always burnt, crunchy, and oily :/ waffles and pancakes used to have this really delicious home made cinnamon taste, but now they just taste like bisquick mix w cinnamon added. The bacon is pretty good though- thick cut and peppered. everything else on the menu is standard breakfast that you could get from anywhere else. Eggs are ehh. Wouldn't recommend. The service is really quick with greeting you and taking your order initially, but since they don't have assigned tables, it's very hard trying to order something else afterwards. Plus It's always packed like a sardine can. You are maybe 6 inches away from another table, and when they seat 3 people at a table meant for 2 (which they do constantly), it really jams up the restaurant. Never order to-go because they will eff it up. Every time. If you're looking for a quick place to grab food for 2 people or less, then this is okay. Lunch is pretty good. The restaurant is way less busy for lunch and the lunch food is good. Just don't order it to-go."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Tuesday morning, still very busy.  Hip cafe/restaurant with mostly 2 or 4 person tables.   Pre-meal: Coffee was smooth and delicious.  The strawberry jam is home made.  Mom couldnt stop talking about the OJ.   Plate: Chop n Chick Pork chop was tender.  Eggs cooked to perfection.    Definitely satisfied."}
{"text":"Soooo good. We were kinda short on time and we're concerned it would take a while....nope! Food was out in no time and yes...fresh! Got a burrito and the kilt lifter. Gf got the BLT and an ice t. Both of ours looked so good we half'd it. Bacon was awesome and the jalapeños were on point! We live here and have never been to the location downtown...we'll  be headed there when we return. Oh btw staff was great. Super friendly and the price was not bad at all....especially for the airport. Can't get 2 crappy pizza and no drinks from pizza Hut for that price. Sold!"}
{"text":"Since breakfast isn't my favorite meal to eat out (I like to eat as soon as I get up...breakfast is yummy just rolled out of bed), I had not tried, but  only been hearing raves about Matt's Big Breakfast for literally about a year, so I knew it had to be good...good enough to try breaking my fast outside my own kitchen.  Luckily it wasn't too crowded (as I'd heard it might be).  We were seated at a window counter, but then moved once our food came to a little table by the door.  The staff was ultimately accommodating to the best experience for us.   The food was beyond delicious.  Egg salad sandwich with chips (I told you I wasn't a huge breakfast-out person), a waffle, and potatoes, and chocolate milk.  It was all SO delicious!  And SO MUCH!  We were able to take most of the sandwich home for later.  By the way, the break was AMAZING...just amazing.  My favorite thing I think (besides the food) was how friendly everyone was--from the staff to the customers.  It also was cool because since Matt's is small (but not too small), you wind up talking to the people around you.  Three tables joined in our conversation to complain about State Senator Russel Pearce, who led the slaughter of AZ's education budgets particularly in Spring 2009...but that's a different story...  I need to go back to Matt's soon--it was a great time."}
{"text":"When I recently visited the Arizona area I had heard this restaurant mentioned repeatedly. So l tried the restaurant for breakfast one day to see for myself how great the food was. As soon as I entered the restaurant I was greeted immediately and told that I could sit anywhere which was great. Soon after I picked a table I was approached by a friendly waiter with a menu. Looking over the menu I initially wanted to try the pancakes but the menu offers them alone so I chose the waffle which included bacon on the side. However, I asked if I could substitute the bacon for the apple smoked sausage that was offered with their French toast special. If you want eggs you will have to order them separately which I found a little annoying.  Once the food was served the presentation was great but I must admit I expected more in the taste area. For one when I tried the waffle the taste of flour was very overwhelming to me. I have definitely had better tasting waffles. The sausage that I was charged a extra $4.00 for tasted like a smoked kielbasa type sausage instead of the breakfast style I expected. I also ordered eggs and asked that they not be cooked to hard but they were.     Maybe my expectations were to high from all of the hype I heard but I wasn't very impressed with the food especially at the prices that they charged."}
{"text":"Great food.  House made preserves are amazing.  Love being able to get bone-in pork with breakfast.  Sausage and potatoes well done.  Only complaint was watery, listless poached eggs."}
{"text":"What am I missing here?  I have heard about Matt's since moving to Phoenix almost 5 years ago, but never wanted to wait outside in the heat to try it.  Now that they have moved into a bigger building, I figured I could try it.  The space is cute -- kind of a minimalist industrial theme.  I was not AT ALL impressed with the menu.  Not much to choose from, and you'll end up having to order items a la carte if you want variety in your meal (e.g., I didn't see any meals that included pancakes, a side of breakfast meat and eggs -- in fact, the pancakes don't even include a side of breakfast meat, so you have to order that a la carte).  I ordered the waffle, which does come with a side of bacon, and an orange juice.  The orange juice, although fresh-squeezed and very good, had to be the smallest glass of OJ I have ever seen. It was basically a large shot glass.  At $2.50 a glass, I felt a little jilted.  The waffle was really good!  It was definitely fresh and buttery.  The bacon left a lot to be desired.  It was pretty fatty, and the pepper crust really didn't add anything to the flavor.   Maybe my expectations were too high based on all of the rave reviews I have heard about Matt's, but my experience was just okay."}
{"text":"No greeters! No hostess! Full place and looks like one server for 100 people and 2 bartenders!! Had to seat ourselves at a dirty table and waited for any kind of attention for 5 minutes and then took off!! Nice job Manager!!!"}
{"text":"Casual but not very comfortable. Dark & drab. Extremely over priced & their food is not kid friendly.  Their biscuits are good. But for a simple breakfast I'm just not impressed. I can't imagine ever going back."}
{"text":"Whoa - what a bunch of spoilsports!    What's not to love about Matt's Big Breakfast (except for the wait)?  My friend and I are serious breakfast aficionados, hailing from Philly where we regularly b'fast at Sabrina's, Honey's, Carmen's Country Kitchen and Morning Glory Diner - all fine, glorious breakfast establishments.  Suffice it to say that neither of us are slouches when it comes to knowing a killer breakfast when we come across one - and he makes a mean frittata himself and I make sublime homemade buttermilk pancakes.    I read about Matt's online (altho I must say that I somehow fortunately missed the  ridiculously pretentious and nit-picky (too much rosemary for your retainer??? Get a life!) \"yelp\" reviews) so we decided to stop by for breakfast after flying in to Phoenix this past Saturday.    As much as we love a good b'fast, we both despise a long wait ... but hey, we had nothing better to do and struck up conversations with other waiting souls and paid a visit to the nearby flea-bag Coronado Motel to use the restroom and soak up the atmosphere.  Matt's provides a cooler of flavored water and the time passed pretty quickly.  IT WAS SO WORTH THE WAIT!  It's days later and I can still taste the perfectly light and fluffy (neither undercooked or overcooked) omelette, brimming with top quality cheddar cheese (who could imagine a basic omelette could taste so heavenly?).  The home-fries were bursting with flavor with the addition of rosemary, onions and peppers ... and the toast ... oh the toast ... homemade sourdough cut into thick slices, toasted and served with homemade jam.  My partner's special was eggs blended with some kind of slightly spicy sausage and cheese.  The coffee, too, is perfect, neither too strong or too mild and served with real cream and raw sugar.    Service is fast, friendly and we were treated to the owner's adorable son seating guests and advising of the day's specials.    Didn't need to eat again until dinner - if you're in Phoenix, ignore the \"yelp\" twitwits - you simply MUST visit Matt's Big Breakfast."}
{"text":"Even though we have to drive 15 minutes to get here we are NEVER disappointed! We love that Matt works with a local butcher and other local vendors too."}
{"text":"Food was great... wait was long but it was because of how popular that place was. The employees were very friendly."}
{"text":"Because of the name of the restaurant and the line outside, I gained certain expectations. I was expecting a BIG BREAKFAST and amazing tasting food. However, I was disappointed.   I had the Chop and Chick with home fries. This item was not worth the wait or the price. The serving size was small. The taste was forgettable.   I also had the Waffle, which saved the experience. I have to admit it was tasty. I love a waffle where the batter is sweet and doesn't need too much syrup. Also, it came with a slice of bacon, which had a kick to it making it super good. Lastly, it was decently priced. I was close to saying that it's worth the wait, but I found out it's not too hard to make a similar waffle at home by just adding malt to your waffle mix.   This wouldn't be my first choice for breakfast, but if you're like me and you like to try places featured on the Food Network, just order the bacon. It's unique and different."}
{"text":"Bad Decisions I've Made in 2017:  1. Picking up a skillet fresh out of the oven with my bare hand. 2. Believing the NY Giants were going to win. 3. Leaning into the trunk of a cab too early, and gashing my head on the rebounding door.  Good Decisions I've Made in 2017:  1. Getting the Sonrisa Burrito before I got on a plane back to NYC.  (Clearly killing it this year.)  Admittedly, my Phoenix airport eatery experience is a bit limited, but after drinking liquor of questionable quality until the wee hours of the morning, this burrito quite possibly saved my life.   Although the menu only lists bacon and sausage as meat options, chorizo was a nice surprise choice. Beware, it's going to take 15 minutes for this thing because it's real food, and they have to grill the burrito. Which is so, so worth it, even if you have to miss your flight and live in PHX for the rest of your life.  Well, maybe not then."}
{"text":"My visit was a complete disappoinment.  I drove all the way from Scottsdale because I had heard such good things about Matt's, so I arrived hungry, and with high expectations.    The restaurant was busy, with only counter seating available, so I took one of the available stools.  They are VERY uncomfortable metal stools.  The seats are round, unupolstered, metal, smaller than most folks butts (I am a small woman), insufficiently contoured, and very slippery. I had to pull the stool in close to the counter, wedge my knees against the counter, and keep my feet on the rungs of the stool in order not to feel as if I would slide off.  The hard metal seat was so uncomfortable that I kept looking around in to see if a table opened up.  So, uncomfortably perched, I decided to try the pork chop, eggs, hashbrowns and wheat toast.  The plated food looked good.  The eggs were fine and cooked as ordered but even after trying all 3 of the salt shakers on the counter, I couldn't get enought salt without opening the shaker, and though I am not a heavy salter, everything needed salt.  The pork chop looked appealing but turned out to be dry, overcooked, difficult to cut even with the steak knife that was provided, and tasteless (seriously),   I could see that the meat was seasoned, but I couldn't tast whatever they used.  I didn't understand the texture of the hash browns.  The top and bottom were crisp and pretty good, but the middle (which comprised most of the order) was really wet.  Hungry as I was, I ate some of the crispy part of the hash browns, a little of the pork chop, a couple bites of toast, and only one of the eggs because nothing appetizing remained to eat with the second one (I can't handle eggs alone).  No big breakfast at Matt's for me.  I was too disappointed to even complain about my meal.  I just paid my check and left for the treck back to Scottsdale with no plan to ever return to Matt's."}
{"text":"Wasn't Worth the Drive Across Town  I had heard a lot of hype about Matt's, and had friends who went there who raved about the place, so I made the 30 minute drive to try it out.   The place was packed, and had people waiting for tables, so I took an open spot at the counter. To start with, the stools were completely made of metal, including the seat which was hard, slippery, and shaped like a button mushroom with no contours for comfort. I was uncomfortable and felt like I had to brace my knees against the counter in order not to slide off.  It didn't take very long to place my order, for the \"Chop & Chick\" and I was brought coffee right away. The server was friendly. The coffee was alright, but the server didn't return to see if I wanted a refill while I was waiting for my breakfast. The wait to receive my food was on the long side, but I can see that being so busy would slow the process. The wait wouldn't have been a big deal, but my stool was so extremely uncomfortable that I almost left.  When I was just about at the end of my patience sitting so uncomfortably, my food came, and the server finally refilled my coffee.   I can't say anything good about it. The portion was average - disappointing given the \"Big\" in the restaurant's name. My pork chop was way overcooked (dry) and apparently unseasoned, and there is nothing complementary that I can say about the home fries. They didn't mess up the scrambled eggs, but my breakfast overall was so unappealing that I only ate a couple of bites. Since my server hadn't returned to see if my meal was satisfactory, I decided to throw in the towel and just get off of that stool and out of there. I left enough money for the food, headed out the door, and back across town and had a fine breakfast elsewhere.   At Matt's, I didn't get quality, quantity, value, flavor or service. I didn't even get breakfast."}
{"text":"Wish this place was more consistent. Our best time here was a weekday. and they got 5 stars but my last 2 experiences have been on a weekend mid day on a Sunday which was not favorable; never to return at that time. But we decided to go at 7:30am on a Saturday. It was busy but not crazy busy so we had high hopes for a better experience. And it was better. My husband loved his waffle and bacon.  I had an cheddar cheese omelet with sauteed mushrooms, onions and red peppers that was amazing. The hash browns are great; crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Their bread is very good especially with the homemade jam. The bacon was a little over-cooked almost but not quiet burnt. That was the only downside other than for the awful bitter coffee. I'm sure we will return since my husband does like the waffles."}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast?   I'd say the only thing big about this place is the wait. When you walk up to the tiny place (it looks like a miniature brick block that you're not sure is big enough for humans), you scrawl your name down on a standard piece of notebook paper... and then you wait. Not fifteen minutes. Not twenty. More like 60. At least they have free water outside because, let's face, even in October, the Phoenix sun can be brutal.  Peaking inside, you realize why there's such a wait: about 8 tables (most seat 2 or 4) and about 5 stools at the breakfast bar. It's no wonder... If you do the math, the average person takes about 30-45 minutes to eat breakfast. So, add the ordering time... the cooking time... the debit card time... And you have about an average of an hour per meal. The odds are against you.  But, you put your name down, so you might as well suck it up. It's going to be a BIG wait for Matt's Breakfast. So, it's no wonder the food gets such great reviews. You're ravenous by the time your name is called -- you'd eat the fake flowers if you could away with it.   Coffee is meh. At least they bring ya real cream. That's awesome.   The decor is minimal. It's said the color orange makes one feel hungrier. I really don't think Matt needs to worry about his patrons being hungry by the time they sit down to eat. Again, the wait is BIG.   But, I'll stop whining about that. Moving on...   I ordered the daily special - a scramble with mushrooms and fotini cheese. It came with home fries and two wedges of cinnamon raisin bread. It looked very good when it arrived. One bite of the scramble and I thought, \"I could have made this.\" The home fries were bland... nothing like Kerby Lane's in Austin, Texas (if you've ever been, you know what I'm talking about... please, somebody wipe the drool from my face...). The redeeming piece was the bread. Granted, it's not the best bread I've had, but it was pretty yummy. I made sure to finish all that off, but I left 1/2 my scramble and all but a couple bites of my home fries behind.   As for the service, is was above average. Not extraordinary, like I somehow expected from a place like this that boasts the cozy feel of eating among friends. The service was prompt, though, and the people working were friendly and seemed to be in a chipper mood -- that's hard to imagine when you've been on your feet since before 6 a.m. with a consistent rush. One of the cute waitresses even made people outside laugh with, \"We accept all kinds of payment. Cash. Credit. Check. Or you can work in the kitchen for a little bit.\" I thought her happy-go-lucky attitude was a breath of fresh air.   In conclusion...   Walking away from the tiny place, I commented, \"I'm pretty sure I won't be going back there.\"   From all the great reviews I've read, I had to try this place. I'm glad I did... it was definitely an experience, especially since the police showed up to deal with some next door squabble/drug bust/whoknowswhat. At least while I was waiting, I had free entertainment to occupy my time."}
{"text":"Great place to get good food, people watch and there was no wait! I was able to spend quality time with my dad here and we thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast."}
{"text":"Lunch there too! New location in Tempe. Great stop after a long run around TTL. I went for the turkey rouben. Friend went all out breakfast: pancakes with a gigantic omelet. Do not eat here often. But I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Dunno if you can really call it a big breakfast, but it's usually a good breakfast. Seems like it's a scratch cooked kitchen because the food seems so fresh and tasty.  We liked the salami scramble with the fresh baked wheat toast,, it works well.  Sweet as sugar, attractive waitresses who are appreciative of their customers and seem to be right there for ya. They always remember you.  Beware that you are charged for all drink re-fills except coffee, and they may not mention it to you,, and suddenly your bill doubles.  Yeah,,, you have a wait, even for the 5 seat counter,, and sometimes they'll seat an employees family member way ahead of you,, and sometimes forget to check the sign-in list and customers are left stranded outside and ignored,, that really sucks.  If ya feel un-loved outside sitting on the on deck bench, perhaps peek inside and remind them someones waiting.  Bring quarters for the parking meters. A buck fifty an hour.  Cramped and uncomfortable seating throughout. No place for a fat man,, non-fat only.  Opens at 6:30 AM and they usually call it a day roughly around 2:30 PM. Closed Mondays last we rolled through.  I like almost everything on the menu, though it seems when a good food place gets national media attention, their quality thus backs into hell.   We'll see with Matts."}
{"text":"Hardly a big breakfast.  One small slice of toast, a pre-frozen tile of hash browns and a couple eggs like you'd get anyplace.   Matt's has become a chain and defaulted to chain portions, attitude and quality.   Get your order straight, it's unlikely your server will check back on your meals.  If you have attractive girls in your group the female servers will be rude and surly. They eat their own kind.   Uncomfortable seats.   Two and a half stars.  For the money it should be better and at one time it was better."}
{"text":"Everyone kept telling me THIS was the place to go for great breakfast. I found their menu limited. Perhaps this is why they were suppose to be so good? Do a few things \"great\" and people will come back. I think it's more about a lack of decent breakfast choices for the Biltmore area.  PRO: The wait was only 15mins during a holiday. Bacon was VERY good. Great service and high quality napkins. 100% pure maple syrup and raw sugar. CON: Their coffee, eggs, hash browns, sausage links, waffles, and pancake was just average.  If I was in the area, I would go again. However, being 25 miles away from Glendale/Peoria, I'd stick with U.S. Egg, IHOPs, or Ronnie's Cafe."}
{"text":"I was excited when I had enough time till my flight to eat here. I was a little underwhelmed considering how much people love this place.   They were accommodating and quick, which is important for an airport restaurant obviously.   I ordered the breakfast burrito. It has too many Jalepenos and not enough other flavors. I had to pick half of them out and then add salt pepper and hot sauce for it to taste good. Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish?? Maybe the one in dt phx is better? I wanted to love it but it was just bland.   I'm willing to give it another shot but no breakfast burrito for me again."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place since I moved here 3 years ago... But had been detoured by the long wait that comes with the fantastic reputation. I had some friends in town.. we ventured down there. We waited 45 minutes. We weren't expecting anything great by that point, but were committed to trying it. The gave us menus in line & took our order, so that when we sat down finally, our food & drink followed immediately. As doubtful as we were after standing that long, I have to say it was worth every minute. Down to the coffee, everything was spectacular. I ordered the special, steak and eggs. BEST BREAKFAST EVER! Like me, don't wait so long to try it and don't be discouraged by the long lines. It is phenomenal."}
{"text":"First time here was on a Tuesday morning around 10:30.  I've always heard this place was busy so I thought we'd be good at this time.  We were able to be seated right away but I was still amazed on how many people were there for breakfast at this hour.  Atmosphere was a little noisy but service was quick.  The coffee was just right for my liking, and I had the scrambled eggs with salami with side of hash browns and wheat toast.  I had actually ordered the home fries but got hash browns, which was perfectly ok because they were amazing.  The strawberry jam was fantastic as well.  I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Nice alternative to lgoNo! Pkg & good eats! Lot of great alternatives in arcadia/biltmore area."}
{"text":"Food was great! First time trying out their breakfast food here. I got \"The Hog and Chick\" and it was fantastic & delicious! It was so packed when we got there and right when we sat down, it slowed down. Service was good even though she needed to smile more lol but it's fine. The food came at the expected time which is great. I liked it!"}
{"text":"I chickened out and just got the regular bacon and eggs.  But the Honey Lemonade was BOMB!!"}
{"text":"The food was so good! I ordered the waffle and it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was perfect! The OJ is freshly squeezed and you can tell! The hash browns were perfect as well. Go have brunch with a friend:) I recommend it:)"}
{"text":"Food was great. Eggs were perfect, delicious pancakes. Very nice servers. Not worth the wait in the summer months. We sat/stood in 90 degree weather for 45 min with minimal shade and seating. No waiting room inside. I'd go again when it cools off"}
{"text":"Good food and made fresh to order, but because of the TV coverage on Food Network and tiny size you can expect LONG waits to get in. Not so special it's worth a 60-90 minute wait for me."}
{"text":"First off, we went with a group of six on a Tuesday morning at 10:30am and STILL had to wait about 45 minutes for two tables of 3.  BUT, the food was worth the wait as I had the delicious special with jalapeno and sausage scrambled, with hash browns and a fresh tortilla.  Awesome!  Great coffee too!  In fairness the line moves pretty fast, but this is a small place so if you're considering coming with a big group, be forewarned that you'll wait longer for a table together.  We also learned while we were eating that Matt's was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network.  So that may be the reason for the business too...fewer locals and more looky-loos.  Regardless, I'd go back in a flash and highly recommend Matt's!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the customer service was great,  but not sure if the wait is worth being a regular diner here... there was a fantastic coffee shop less than a block to the east where we spent some time while waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Well I finally made it to Matt's on a trip to Phoenix and all I can say is WOW.  Fresh local coffee, fantastic bacon and hash browns too.  Do yourself a favor and put this place on your bucket list whenever you are in Arizona"}
{"text":"Where do I begin???? This is hands down the best breakfast place in Phoenix. I went 3 times and I would go everyday if I could. I was in town for work and this was the highlight for me. The reviews are very true, anything you get will satisfy you. I highly recommend the blue berry lemonade made with honey. Absolutely love this place, I got the waffle it was perfect, portion sizes are really great and the staff is always helpful. Portions are fantastic you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Solid portions, very flavorful, quick and great service!    Conveniently located and good atmosphere with full bar."}
{"text":"After a late night out with a few college buddies, we woke up @ the downtown Hyatt starving for a hearty meal.  Einstein Bro's Bagels located downstairs, wasn't gonna satisfy our insatiable craving for some rib-stickin, home cooked food.    When we arrive, there are people milling about the exterior of this tiny restaurant, sipping orange infused water provided by the staff.  We assumed it must be excellent, if these people were willing to wait in the sweltering heat for a coveted seat.  After 15-20 minutes, we feel like celebrities on the VIP list as we're escorted through the door.  I order the Hog & Chick, which provided more than enough hash browns, eggs, toast, and sausage to quell the lumberjack appetite I developed.    The staff was friendly & fast, attentive to our dwindling water glasses and clearing plates quickly.  We were more than pleased with the meal, hospitality and price point--happy to walk a little of this hearty breakfast off, on the way back to the hotel."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this breakfast. The vibe was very nice. Our whole table ordered Hog and Chicks and they were tasty...I would have enjoyed a wee bit more seasoning, but still good flavor."}
{"text":"The Hog & Chick breakfast was great! Loved the homemade strawberry jam for the wheat toast!"}
{"text":"This was a yelp check by my wife that showed decent reviews - so we tried it out. This is by far one of the smallest establishments for food. Total capacity might be 20. The food is like a home cooked meal. That is nice - I usually want a homestyle breakfast when I am out. The wait is quite long but considering the size of the joint - the wait is self explanitory. The staff are friendly and try to make you comfortable. For the 2 of us at a table for only 2 - it was a little too close to dining inside a phonebooth."}
{"text":"Duh. Because this place is the bomb.com! The pancakes and homemade preserves are the best! I usually always get the salami scramble and the lemonade.....and an extra pancake. Because fat."}
{"text":"I recommend this place to everyone I know. I get emotional from the pancakes. They somehow connect with my soul."}
{"text":"i dont think they care that they are so rude. the worst service i have ever had. i was amazed that they would treat their customers like that.   i will not spend any money there"}
{"text":"The waiting time & super noisy small space is too great to ignore. The food was ok but not necessarily worth it. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"After Hiking camelback we hit this place up for some chow. It was pretty dead so we got seated very quickly. They are small and very clean with great waitresses. The breakfast was reasonable for what I got, couple eggs, potatoes and bacon. The Menu is very limited but they have specials everyday. If your looking for a big menu and a lot of options and a big breakfast I would hit up somewhere else. While this place is good, it has its limits."}
{"text":"Just terrible Customer Service experience. Hostess at entrance has no respect for customers, and cant even commit to basics as:  - \"Is the Bar open sitting or List assigned?\" - - \"It's both..\" After having to deal with that, we ended up with mediocre food, in front of us."}
{"text":"Ok, but not worth a significant wait.  The food is good, but anyone from the Midwest (like me) will probably find it to be similar to the average diner back home.  I cannot figure out what the hype is for this place, other than perhaps the fact that this place stands out in a city that really doesn't have too much else to offer."}
{"text":"Really good food I'd say worth the wait pretty much always packed but food is awesome and portions are large service is real friendly. I'd given them 5 stars but the wait can sometimes be a bit much. Thanks Matt"}
{"text":"You gotta love Matts Big Breakfast...a simple menu with the freshest ingredients, good service, and a cozy down home setting that makes you feel like you're eating in Grandma's kitchen. We got lucky on our last visit b/c it was later in the day and drizzling outside, so there was no wait at all and we got right in. I don't think I would try to go here during peak hours on a Saturday or Sunday morning, unless you like waiting a while to get seated.   We ordered the Salami Scramble (good) and the Waffle (great), along with a side of bacon. Their bacon is definitely one of the best in all of Phoenix, that's for sure. It's flavorful and juicy and crisp all at the same time.   I don't think I would change a thing about this place, except for the sketchy location that it is in. It's kind of artsy fartsy and trendy on the one hand, but then on the other hand there are about 5 crack dens surrounding it. Let's just say I wouldn't want to be there alone at night.....hence why it is a breakfast place I guess. We actually experienced some of the shadiness first hand when we went to the hotel next door to go pee after our meal (no bathroom in the place). There was a torn up hooker in her 50's arguing with the lady at the check in desk about money with some guy who was missing all of his front teeth. There was obviously something illegal about to do down in one of the rooms, so we peed as quickly and quietly as we could and left the scene before we could get shot. Even so, getting shot is definitely worth the risk for some of their delicious food!"}
{"text":"Thick bacon was hard to chew and not as tasty as I dreamed it would be after all the other reviews. The rest of our breakfasts were large and unique. Service was very good"}
{"text":"Finally got to experience Matt's Big Breakfast yesterday after hearing about it for so long. We were not disappointed. For Sunday brunchtime, the wait was not too long at approx. 25 minutes. After being seated we were greeted quickly by our server who took and delivered our beverage order. Two people in my party ordered the special and another steak and eggs. The meals were brought out so quickly, it was amazing! They all raved about their dishes. I ordered a waffle with a side of eggs over-medium well which were cooked absolutely perfectly (which happens rarely.) The waffle...oh that waffle!!! It was heaven on a plate! Our server was very personable and kept our beverages filled throughout our meal. A friend had toast with Matt's homemade strawberry jam. Wow!!! Yes...I now have a jar waiting for me in the fridge. So good. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Cute place but food is whatever. It's just a standard place who sells eggs and bacon. Nothing too impressive or interesting. The bacon is good though."}
{"text":"Checked-in and asked for a cup of coffee. Woman at register was a complete bi!$& and was completely disgruntled and on a huge power trip.  I had to purchase a coffee to go and she threw my card onto the counter."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast and very good service. The cafe is also very clean. Can't wait to come back and try something new."}
{"text":"High quality breakfast place. Generally get the hash browns, omelette, and toast. The vegetarian options aren't vast but they're all delicious, and the belgian waffle is a rare treat when I feel like ruining my gym routine. That said, waiting for a table is almost always kind of awful, and the wait staff rarely radiates kindness. It's really good food, so it's often worth it, but it's certainly not perfect. Probably still the best breakfast joint in Phoenix tho."}
{"text":"Yummy and friendly staff! Service was slow but their cheerful attitude made it less painful!"}
{"text":"The Five Spot was one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. Was pleasantly surprised.  The bacon was my favorite part! Mmmm mmmm good!"}
{"text":"I had the parfait. Very big serving. I can't say I was a huge fan of the parfait, but that was my fault not theirs. I didn't realize greek yogurt is supposed to be sour. The fresh squeezed orange juice is worth paying for. I absolutely love fresh squeezed juice. Service was good, and we enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"As someone who has worked in customer service oriented businesses since my first job, I find this as one of the top things when rating all business establishments. From the first minute I walked in, there wasn't a glimpse of good customer service in the place.  The first woman greeted us and asked us to come to her host stand. We said we wanted a table and she told us to write our names down. Already slightly annoying that she asked us to do her job. She told us the wait was 30-45min and that the bar was first come first serve. Since we noticed 3 open seats at the bar, we walked up and got ready to sit down. A man that worked there walked up and said \"you need to put your name on the list.\" I mentioned that we had done that already and that the woman up front had mentioned that the bar was open seating. Very rudely he yelled, \"NO SHE DIDN'T!\" and then pointed to the host stand. You were not there when she told us it was open seating, so do not tell me what she said. Yes, she may have made a mistake, but that isn't my fault. There are much nicer ways to talk to your customers.  This wasn't even the part that made us want to leave. We continued to wait because of the excellent reputation this place has. We waited, we waited, we waited. An hour goes by and we've seen people who came in after us continue to get seated. So I approached the hostess again and mentioned that we had been waiting for over an hour and that others had been seated before us. She picks up her list and says \"well, there's still 20 people in front of you\" and shows me a completely different and new page of names that wasn't there before. I mentioned to her that list wasn't there before and showed her where our name was written. She informed us that we had \"created our own new sheet\" while they still had one they were adding names to and that we put our name in the wrong place. Well, maybe you should have done your job in the first place and written our name down for us. Not only that, even though she knew that we had been there for that long, she didn't offer to rectify the misunderstanding and seat us sooner. I will forever not eat at this place and I urge, nay, I warn you not to eat here either."}
{"text":"if you don't like bacon, i would skip matt's, but if you like bacon, you should go every day. there is no bacon like the bacon at matt's. i have a friend who rants about this at least once a week. i'm certain this is the only meat product this vegetarian misses.  i haven't really tried a lot of things on the menu. i'm a big fan of the specials and the 5 spot."}
{"text":"FIRST!!! The staff was AH-MAAAAA-ZING! Very very nice and polite. Wonderful.   The two stars is because this place is OFFENSIVELY overpriced. I actually left without ordering due to its absurd pricing. LIke Ritz Carlton room service pricing. (Ive ordered room service from the Ritz, I know what that costs) To feed my two little kids and myself breakfast would have been about $50 with tip.     Three pancakes. $7.95  Yes. You read that right. I'm not sure if they have retired US Presidents making them but $8 for three pancakes that cost 3 cents to make seems a bit steep.  Glass of OJ= $4.95  Made from oranges. NOT made from oranges harvested by Angels mind you.  Soda, one brand in a can. NO refills. $2.00 (RC Cola. I didn't even know that they were still in business. Who drinks that crap?) I could go on...  No kids menu. Annoying. NO regualr fountain drinks. Annoying. Absurd pricing. Annoying. Amazing staff. WONDERFUL!  So I think Im going to open a food truck right outside and call it \"Matt's Third cousins Big and realistically priced Breakfast. Whos with me?"}
{"text":"Food was good but the menu was basic. No great selections, kinda normal. I like the waffles better then the pancakes. Freshly squeezed orange juice was good."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Phoenix! Great atmosphere, great food, great service. Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Yes x1000! You have to wait to be seated, usually for awhile... But after you order food is served very quickly, and it is ALWAYS worth the wait. Eat here. End of story."}
{"text":"Love this spot in the midst of the tall State Farm Buildings. Indoor and outdoor seating.  Open and modern look to this vibrant restaurant. We arrived at 10am on a Saturday and did not have to wait to sit indoors which was a nice treat. Cameron was our competent and friendly server. Everything was perfect!  Two had the Skinny and I had the Five Spot-for only half the price of most of the other meals it really is the best deal on the menu.  The bacon is thick and cooked right, the coffee is tasty and and not bitter at all. Everything I want in a breakfast. Enjoy a walk along the water after breakfast."}
{"text":"We had heard so much about Matt's that we decided to eat breakfast there this morning.  The food was mediocre.  My husband ordered the waffle and when he asked for additional syrup the server told us that it would be a $1.50 extra.  He declined the extra syrup and said that it was ridiculous.  When the hostess stopped by the table to ask us how we were doing we told her about the syrup.  She did not handle the interaction well, I pointed out that other restaurants never charge for extra syrup and she basically blew me off and said \"we are not like anyone else, and if we did that we would have the raise the prices.\"  You would be far better off with a price increase.  It became apparent after that, when we received our check immediately,  that someone wanted us to leave because we complained.    This will be our first and last time eating at Matt's.  They can keep their Vermont Maple Syrup, which by the way is not $75 a jug."}
{"text":"Look, airport food is never going to be out of this world spectacular, I've accepted that reality a while back. However, Matt's Big Breakfast in Terminal 4 was decent (again, decent for airport food) and the prices were reasonable. I ordered the honey lemonade which tastes exactly how it sounds as well as the grilled cheese and tomato soup. Simple, clean and cheap. Their breakfast looks legit but I couldn't bring myself to ordering pancakes for the second time in one day especially before my flight back to the 305. Best part of the meal? Our server, Jennifer. She was on the ball and knew exactly when  to provide refills, bring the check and was really cheerful. Hooray for good airport customer service, Snoopy knows it ain't easy!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, and friendly servers. I came here for breakfast on a busy Sunday morning and was seated right away. My food was out in less than 10 minutes after I ordered it and I was never low on coffee with the servers constantly making sure I didn't need anything. I had a Sunday special which consisted of a 3-egg scramble and house potatoes. Both were very good. I will be back for sure next time I stay the night in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We saw the sign Matt's \"BIG\" Breakfast. The wife and i, because we love decent serving sizes, got excited. We were disappointed.  And the service was horrible. Our waitress treated us like we just ran over her dog. Never returning."}
{"text":"Very disappointing . . . I am new to Phoenix and drove out of my way to try Matt's as it had been highly recommended.  The man at the front door was a real jerk.  I gave him the benefit of the doubt the first time and by time #3 I had to leave and go somewhere more friendly. Sorry Matt . . . maybe I will try again another time."}
{"text":"Overrated. Poor service, especially the hosts.  You shouldn't get brownie points for non GMO food- but this place does in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to check out this much hyped about breakfast joint. The staff were very friendly and attentive. The wait wasn't long since I got there around 8:15am. I ordered the waffle, and hubby ordered the griddle cakes with a side of their thick cut bacon. Mine order came with 2 strips of bacon already. The waffle tasted ordinary. There was nothing that screams WOW to me. Again, the griddle cakes were just ok. There was nothing extraordinary about them. I feel like eating at a friend's house, not a much raved about breakfast place. The bacon strips were actually delicious!!! I love the peppery taste to it. It's an average place for breakfast, but not one of the best.  I wouldn't go out of my way to get here if you don't live nearby. I would give it 3.5 stars, but I can't with this app. Overall,  it was a very nice experience as far as the staff, but I feel the food could be better for all the 5 star ratings I have read about."}
{"text":"Probably just a bad night for them, but I interacted with 3 employees and all were short and rude and Uninterested.  I had to ask for a menu, ask if I could order a beer, and when I asked if they have chips and salsa the bartender said \"no\" and walked away. Nuthin. Then couldn't get them to process my payment for 10 minutes. The exception was Karina, a waitress who was friendly. The only smile over a 25 minute period."}
{"text":"So until today I didn't know there was a lot of hype about this place.  Ashley L. suggested it and I said sure why not.  While waiting for her in the parking lot, doors locked and windows up, I decided to look at it on Yelp.  Wow was there a lot of reviews.   So we got there early and there was no wait.  I guess that is rare.  We both got The Hog and Chick with bacon and sourdough bread she got eggs over hard and I got them scrambled and we shared a stack of pancakes.  I have to admit that the food was really good.  I am not saying this because others have said it but because it is my own opinion.  Like I said I didn't even know it existed until she suggested it.  The service was great and we had a great experience.  My only problem is the size.  It is tiny.  Wow.  There is a place on the west side known as The Place and it used to be in a small location and moved to a larger one.  Much easier to get in and the food is still great.  They may stay there because it feels quaint but that I think was the only flaw I saw."}
{"text":"So I have this thing about long waits at breakfast places.  Every town in America seems to have at least one annoyingly popular place with a line  around the corner and overrated pancakes, omelets, etc.  Having visited Matt's on two previous occasions I found it to be great, but because it violated my \"line theory\" I've resisted embracing it.  Until now.  After meeting a friend at Matt's for breakfast this morning (and waiting about 30 minutes) I can honestly say that this place is the real deal.  The food isn't gourmet or even creative, it isn't supposed to be.  Rather it's classic breakfast done to perfection.  Exceptional pork, eggs, potatoes, breads, everything.  Although it pains me to say it, this is a breakfast place worth waiting in line for."}
{"text":"Matts big breakfast was everything it was cracked up to be the wait  was minimal but I would have  waited longer. If needed as a very hip place right off a downtown right now heart of everything I really enjoy the scenery and the service there was top-notch a fantastic place I cannot wait to go back and spend more time which will be soon"}
{"text":"Hats off, gents. You've done it, squeezing a bonafide breakfast gem right in between an insurance building and a lake. I'll admit, I'm charmed, not by your $4.50 orange juice, but by your attention to breakfast mainstays. Nobody hashes a brown quite like Matt's."}
{"text":"This place is a tiny hole in the wall, so make sure to come early and prepare to wait, cause it's worth it.  The staff is super nice and very attentive.  While you are waiting make sure to grab a menu, so you can peruse at your leisure.  Not that you are going to need a lot of time with it, unless you are a really slow reader.  There is only a handful of items, but don't be put off by that. Cause what they do...they do it amazingly!  Daughter had an omelet with cheese and mushroom, Son and Wife did steak and eggs.  I had scrambled eggs and sausage.  Sounds basic, right.  Wrong, it was incredible.  The eggs were all cooked to perfection.  Most people don't know how to cook, so it finishes on the plate.  These people should hold a class on it.  Eggs cooked through and super moist.  The steak was aged and tender.  The Sausage were fresh and infused with subtle smoky flavor.  My Daughter's omelet was as big as her head and filled to the brim with cheese and mushrooms.  Each order came with potatoes, so me being a fatty, I always gotta go with the hash brown.  They were crisp on outside and tender on the in.  It was a great compliment to a wonderful meal.  A meal that was elevated to an eating experience by the attentive and caring staff.  As a whole all the patrons in the restaurant should have hoisted the cooks and wait staff on their shoulder and showered them with praise, but alas a heart felt thank you, will have to do."}
{"text":"Good food, but they have outgrown their restaurant."}
{"text":"I visited this place with my parents. The food overall was decent. The hash browns were overdone. The pancakes were a bit over sweet for my mother but that may be preference. The main issue we had with this eatery was that we felt rushed to eat and leave. Especially when the waitress took my mother's plate without asking which still had several pieces of her ham steak on it. It was so unexpected and quick that we didn't have time to correct the mistake."}
{"text":"Was downtown today so I stopped in for breakfast.  Fundamentally not bad.  On the other hand didn't blow my socks off.    That being said I will give them credit for being able to scramble an egg.  Most places don't know how to do this properly (trust me most places make an omelet and chop that up and call it scrambled eggs...its not).  This is a small place and it seems like everyone in Phoenix is trying to eat there.  So one really irritating note.  The place is crowded, I'm waiting and I see two people finished with their meal just drinking coffee.  I get seated...they're still sitting there.  I get my food...they're still sitting there.  I eat...they're still sitting there.  I pay my bill...they're still sitting there.  I leave...they're still sitting there.    WTF!!!!!!  People are waiting and you're just sitting there.  To make matters worse they pulled out a jug of Arizona Tea and started drinking that.  Double WTF!!!!!!  I guess the management of Matts are too nice and don't bounce people when they should. I'm not sure if that's a good quality or bad.  What I do know is I just saw two of the most inconsiderate people in Phoenix today.  Probably a 3.5 versus a 4, but that wasn't a choice."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast place.  I would not wait in line to get in, but if there are tables available it is a good place for breakfast.  Nothing exciting or extra special, but very good quality and options."}
{"text":"Matt's rocks for breakfast, but lunch is also All American awesomeness!  Cobb salad Macaroni salad Strawberry honey lemonade  The Cobb is fresh & unlike any other with their thick smoky bacon. Best macaroni salad ever . It came in a mound with diced veg, tomatoes- wow. Strawberry lemonade with local honey was money/honey. Love Matt's!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Matts Big Breakfast on camelback yesterday.  It was nice inside and the employees were friendly. I was excited to eat there because I had heard how busy the other Phoenix location was.  I have to say that the food was average.  It was so greasy and shiney that I thought Rihanna was going to walk in and start singing \"shines bright like a diamond\".  I hadn't seen such glistening food since living up in the mountains in Montana.  My wife and I had to ask for extra napkins to dab off all the excess oil. I only ate it cause I was starving, but then felt I needed to run home to get my cholesterol pill.  All jokes aside,  it wouldn't be my first choice next time. But I would be willing to try it again in case maybe the cook was a little heavy handed.  One more note to the owners.  The toast was sopping wet in butter too.  I had to tear off the upper layer of bread.  Oil is not the answer for a good breakfast. My wife makes awesome dishes that any restaurant would love and she uses Pam spray.  That's really all you need.  I ordered the 2 egg breakfast with hashbrowns, bacon and toast. + coffe"}
{"text":"Expect to wait but the food is worth it. Fresh and local with nice portions. Bacon is thick and delicious and coffee was really good too. I got the breakfast sandwich and the entire thing just about melted in my mouth - the bread was super fresh. Their homemade jams are simply delightful. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food here was really good and quick. I had the chicken apple sausage eggs hash browns and the big sourdough toast. The coffee was a bit weak but the food was good and the service."}
{"text":"Tight, excellent menu. Friendly efficient staff. Great vibe. This is how a breakfast spot should be. I'm impressed - by the quality of the food, the cheery staff, and the fact that they run this place like a well-oiled machine."}
{"text":"Bright and early, there I was standing in line, waiting to get into Matt's Big Breakfast.  The wait was tolerable, perhaps because it was still early (roughly 8AM).  Although, this tiny restaurant only provides limited number of seating; they were well-managed and promptly operated.  In addition, the waiter was friendly and the service was just flawless.  It didn't just take the restaurant's staff members to provide customers' smooth dining experiences; the customers also knew the etiquette.  They get in, eat, and get out, making the wait bearable.  Like the name of the restaurant, the portions of our breakfast were extremely satisfying.  The extra plus Matt's deserves is the reasonable pricing that is particularly easy on your wallet.  Both their breakfast and lunch menu items range from $4 to $8 - incredibly affordable.  I ordered the five spots with home fries.  As the dish was placed in front of me, the smell of fresh rosemary had swiftly increased my appetite.  The home fries were buttery, perfectly cooked, and well-seasoned.  The eggs weren't as fluffy as I'd like, but overall the pros definitely exceed the cons.  I'd definitely stop by whenever I happen to be in town.  Bottom-line, good food, good service, and affordable prices, who wouldn't be a fan?"}
{"text":"After a year I finally made it back to Arizona. Matt's big breakfast was the first place I wanted to eat for a morning meal. I was not disappointed at all. The waffle was one of the best that I've ever had. The bacon was tasty and I enjoyed every bite of my meal. The strawberry honey lemonade is great to have as well. It is a bit noisy inside, but you barely notice it when chowing down on the delicious food."}
{"text":"Hmmmmm, another place I heard about for years. Movie stars love it! Locals love it! Food critics love it! I am not a breakfast food eater for breakfast so I figured I would never try it. Hey, I am OK with Denny's or McDonalds for Breakfast! I knew I had to go when the gentleman sitting next to me on the plane recently told me that he purposely landed a layover in Phx just to try the darn place. ( I am like,\" Really\"? But then I thought I might do the same over a great NY pizza sooooooooo I cut the guy some slack-lol) So when I found myself Downtown yesterday I stopped by. Ok, right away I had issues. Nowhere to park. I found a spot on the street and paid 2 bucks for metered parking.( And worried about a break in since the neighborhood is real bad)  We are not starting off well. I then walked the two blocks to the restaurant. Being 10:30 am on a Tuesday I figured the normal 1-2 hour wait would not apply to me, yet the place was not dead. ( Hmmmm, good sign in today's economy) I had to sit outside for a little while but the wait was less than 10 minutes and the woman who worked there was very nice.                                                                                                              The place is an old dive. Now don't get me wrong I love old buildings. Super fan of Coronado Cafe, Teeter house, and other old houses renovated into eating establishments but this place is not one of those. Frankly, it is pretty gross. Small and old looking with uneven floors. It only has 6 tables  or so and a tiny bar. No wonder the wait. The menu only has 6 things on the Brkfst side and 5 or so on the lunch side. I ordered a Salami Scrambled Egg plate with Rosemary potatoes.Maybe I  am not an EGGSpert so I couldn't tell what the big deal was and why they are quoted as being so much better than elsewhere. Now, they are cage free eggs and cooked in butter. They tasted good but I didn't like have a heart attack or moaning fit over them or anything. The Rosemary Potatoes were good but nothing I would wait in line hours for. I have had better. The coffee tasted average. Now, the bread was a different story YUMMERS! Smashing! I asked them if it was homemade and they said they get it at Wildflower Bakery. Soooo I am thinking to myself there are plenty of those in town. I will just go there next time. No wait or parking issues. I ordered an egg salad sandwich to go. Which was delish, BTW and the Homemade Mac salad was outstanding. So, my foodie fingers type, What's the big deal? Did I order the wrong thing? Why the fuss? What am I missing here?  It was very good I agree but Oprah and Guy Fierro????? REALLY? The service was fine. Everyone was nice.  I did go off hours so small wait. I honestly don't know how it made the Food Channel or why people wait three hours in the heat to eat here.      I would go back sure but if I had never heard of the place I wouldn't have ranked it even in the top 100 of my favorite dining experiences."}
{"text":"I totally agree with some of the other reviews. I just do not get it. The food is not good and the service is terrible. They do have good bread but it is Wildflower Bread. I can go there for better food. I guess the whole buy local thing is important but the food is just not that good. I have had better at Denny's. And that is sure saying a lot. I do admit Their Egg Salad sandwich for lunch is not too bad but again nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"The food was just okay for me. Nothing special. I had the waffle. The real problem I had was with the lack of respect this place has. During peak hours they rush you in and out. They practically delivered the check with the food! We couldn't even enjoy ourselves because we were being rushed at every point in the service."}
{"text":"Foods great. Bartender...not so much. Poor attitude and rude. Stay in the main terminal."}
{"text":"Pretty basic airport food. I was expecting a little better based on the look and design of the place. I got the breakfast burritos and it was cold (which was surprising because it came out very fast), the sausage seemed undercooked and my eggs were a weird grey color."}
{"text":"Trip downtown for flowers. Wife had seen or someone had told her about Matt's.  Wow! Did find a place to park but had about a 20 min wait. We were there fairly early on a Saturday morning and really did not expect this many people downtown for breakfast.   Decor was mostly just a large room with a small room and tables.  I am one or the people that say it is pretty hard to mess up breakfast. I am pretty much an egg, bacon, toast person. But there are many things you can do to make this breakfast great.  The eggs were cooked just perfect, the beacon was thick and taste, the potatoes were different from what I expected and were great, now the toast. I usually get rye toast as I did this time. Surprise it was marble rye. My favorite. This is the only place I Have ever gotten it at breakfast. My wife got the same breakfast only with sourdough and scrambled eggs.  The food was very good. The service was OK. I know there was a lot of people waiting to eat. I felt rushed.  When I am in the area at breakfast time I will be stopping in for a meal."}
{"text":"Big plates of food so bring an appetite! Fresh farm to table food that is so delicious and the coffee they serve tastes great!"}
{"text":"There isn't much to say about Matt's other than they have the best damn breakfast in the Valley.  You have to appreciate a homegrown diner where the owner makes everyday appearances, his wife runs the place, and they use the best, freshest, local ingredients.  Kudos.  I get the Hog and Chick every single time I go, I never stray.  Eggs over medium, hash browns, wheat toast, and the best damn bacon ever.  Always perfect every time.  I have never tasted bacon so good in my life.  The hash browns are out of this world.  They get shredded super fine and are cooked up on the griddle in loads of butter.  The BEST.  If you want to seem cool and in the know, at lunch time order the Insider Burger.  It's a traditional burger smothered in cheese, bacon added, and topped with an egg.  My brother loves it.  Similar to a Royal Red Robin Burger, but obviously superior.  The only negative is the wicked crowd that can form for breakfast.  Bring a lot of water with you and some sunscreen if you can brave the summer wait.  Simply put, this place is amazing.  I am so lucky to be so close to this place.  Sometimes to avoid the wait, my husband and I wake up at 6:30 on a Saturday morning, head over for breakfast and beat the crowds.  After a hearty button bursting breakfast, we ride our bikes home and go back to sleep.  That is the life my friends.  You should try it."}
{"text":"Awesome food great price friendly staff we will be coming back for sure when we come to Phoenix I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Nice new location with the same small feel and long lines to get in. Awesome bacon! I generally order sausage with eggs but you have to get the bacon here. I have ordered the burger before and it is a very good size good quality burger. Don't missed the old location which is less than a block away from the new restaurant. DDD was there for a reason."}
{"text":"Been eating at Matt's Big Breakfast since they were at their original location a couple blocks away.   Always busy with a line to get in but great places are like that so if you want to eat quickly go to Dennys so I don't have to wait so long.  Everything is made from scratch and fresh. The Waffles are outstanding as are the Griddlecakes.   I am a really  big fan of the Big Butter Burger also. The burger is just plain good and when they bring it to you, you will be happy.  If you can make sure you get some bacon here which is very good.  Service is good and the new location is spacious compared to the original restaurant.  What is nice is that the small feel still transferred to the current location.  Would recommend going there either early in the morning or later prior to closing to minimize your wait.  Can't wait to go back!"}

{"text":"Well it's been about 4.5 years since I have been back to Matt's, only because I moved away from AZ. This was my first time at the Tempe location. The staff did not disappoint. Everything was a amazing. Can't wait for our next trip back."}
{"text":"We waited a little less than 2 hours at Matt's- we went on a Saturday morning around 10:00am. I ordered the 5 spot with hash browns.  The hash browns were really good, thin & crispy. I didn't really like my sandwich that much, it was ok. I didn't really cAre too much for the grilled onions & thick bacon....I think I prefer thinner crispier bacon? All in all I wouldn't wait 2 hours again to eat here- it seemed average to me but glad I tried it. Oh & one last thing I didn't like that they didn't have free refills on beverages...it was sold by the bottle or can."}
{"text":"Food was okay, I am not waiting all day for it though.  If I could go in and get a table right away I'd eat here again, but waiting more than 10 minutes, no thank you!  I would rather walk to Matadors or First Watch....  P.S. Go for the rosemary potatoes not the hash browns, unless, of course, you would like some hash browns with your grease."}
{"text":"Perfect if you are craving a home-style breakfast.  I had a wonderful mushroom scramble, sausage, and the walnut raisin toast.  The portions were big and the food was very good - quality ingredients.  My only gripe is the orange juice.  It was $2.50 for a shot glass size cup of orange juice and it was half pulp."}
{"text":"Downtown location which was good for where we were staying, we got there early so we beat the crowd, but when we left it looked to be a long wait.  If you have kids I wouldn't say it's the most kid friendly, as I do not have a kids menu  The service was great, and the food came out very fast.    The man you did not have a very big selection, but the food that they did have was mediocre."}
{"text":"So...have been to the downtown and am a big fan of the salami scramble.  Fresh and real ingredients do make for a great meal.  However...the service today was absolutely horrible.  Not simply orders wrong, but drink orders weren't taken for a good 10 minutes and cocktails didn't come out until halfway through the eating our meals.  We were sitting less than 30 feet from the full bar so it was tempting to just go and place an order for the same drinks and see which would get there first.  Location is nice.  Tempe hipsters aren't too bad to deal with.  All in all a good meal, but I'll drive past this location and go to downtown next time.  Addendum:  My Bloody Mary cost more than my entire meal.  Now...maybe it was bottomless, but as stated above...didn't come until late into the meal and never saw my server until he brought the check."}
{"text":"so we came here on a Thursday morning and were able to sit right down which was nice compared to the upwards of two hour wait on our first attempt to come here. Like many we saw the restaurant on TV and thought we check it out given the hype. The menu is pretty limited and it was more than a little loud on the inside but overall kind of your typical hipster downtown location for anything in America.    Instead of your normal diner fair which is kind of what we were expecting there was a lot of nicer styles of foods with definitely a direction towards local and organically grown which is a nice refreshing change. Service was OK as they were definitely moving people in and out.  Ordered the salami scramble and home fries and it was on point. My wife ordered the waffle which was decent.  Had iced tea because that was the most appealing on the menu for a beverage and we got one refill in spite of servers walking by repeatedly most notably one particular blonde female that just kept walking and staring at my empty glass. Overall the staff seem to be pleasant but seem to want to move bodies in and out rather than provide customer service.  Our server for example took our order and that was the last we saw them until it was time for the check.  The food is great and that's the reason why it is scoring as high as it is (wanted to go with a 2).  Service was timely but impersonal.  Clearly they have changed the menu from when they were on television which is neither good nor bad as again the food was great (at least mine was).  I don't see coming back again anytime soon but I will say that I highly recommend the salami scramble with home fries."}
{"text":"What can I say that other haven't? It's all true...this place kicks breakfast ass! I have been to several high dollar steakhouses that don't cook a steak as perfectly as Matt's does. You will be able to find me here at least a few times a month..."}
{"text":"Bad food bad service.  Heard about this place . Cold waffle, servers insulted that I would notice cold food.  Would never recommend .  I see they are building new place in my neighborhood. 32nd and Camelback. Will tell my neighbors not to bother."}
{"text":"Great spot. The food is amazing and the wait is absolutely worth it. My biggest recommendation would be to ensure that you have about 1-2 hours before going because you may have to wait 45 minutes to get in. However, if you enjoy breakfast, you will leave here happy."}
{"text":"I ordered Huevos rancheros. It's pretty good. Very good service. Good food. The sandwhich looks good. Good pork chop. Weird restroom place.  There were lots of people lining up to just get into the restaurant. It's easier to get into the restaurant in singles than as in a group. FYI. Great hidden place to dine in."}
{"text":"Best waffle with fresh maple syrup I've had in a long time. Also, the honey lemonade is phenomenal.  Excellent service. Apparently it's very popular, but early mornings before 730 are quiet and peaceful."}
{"text":"i know the real secret to Matt's Wu-tang Style.   some people may think Matt's is over rated. but i know that to be false. Matt's is THE BEST BREAKFAST...period. there has not been a single time i was unhappy with the service, price, or wait.  i would wait an hour, heck two hours if need be.   the 5-spot is by far my favorite breakfast item. its like a full on taste cell orgy. with over 50 taste cells per taste bud and a human tongue containing several million taste buds you have to figure that is alot of ecstasy in your mouth.   if i could justify the time spent waiting as a business expense i would be there every morning.   Matt and Erenia have a great thing going here."}
{"text":"Food is okay, nothing that I would consider great to merit having to wait outside for an hour an a half to be seated just to end up being placed at a bar."}
{"text":"A little late delivering the water, but it was Sunday morning crowd.  Please tell me though, does anyone know how to cook a poached eggs in Phoenix? I keep getting overcooked poached eggs. It is very disappointing. Overall the food was tasty. Just not a big wow.  Note: when I went to pay I mentioned my eggs were overcooked, and the manager reduced my bill by half of the most expensive meal."}
