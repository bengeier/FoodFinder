{"text":"Being a Personal Trainer, Health Coach and Physique Competitor, healthy eating is my life. I usually go by protein house because I used to work their and I know the food is great however when I was looking on google maps for directions this place popped up instead. (Thank you Jesus :)   I ordered the baked tuna Tostada.... it was only $3.50 and more than enough for me. It was sooooo delicious. The cut cucumbers and salad are nice and crispy and you can tell the food is fresh. I also ordered a protein shake and she so kindly made me 1 based off my preferences. Again Delicious  I have to say, I prefer this place to protein House or any other smoothie/healthy eating spot I've come across. Literally half the price (I didn't see anything over $10) and great food, clean spot.    So to not be one sided Only thing I would say would make this place better is if they had wifi but then again it's not a huge place and if they did they'd have no open tables for eating customers so get yourself a hotspot  if you're coming here to study like myself"}
{"text":"This is the best protein place I've been to. Today I got the strawberry banana shake with almond milk instead of 2% it was so good. I've gotten food here before and it was filling and the best    I'd recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"They have so many healthy options.  The juices are amazing and the turkey pesto sandwich is delicious.  The service is great!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, the quesadilla with no meat is my favorite, the only thing is the customer service is horrible. I've had multiple occasions where the staff isn't keen on being welcoming, or getting my order right. I will not be coming back here again, not at least until they change their staff, other than that this place is good, just don't expect to be treated nice."}
