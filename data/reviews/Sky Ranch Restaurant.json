{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a hope a getting a good argentina steak. We got there a bit early for dinner, around 5.30pm. We sat on the table next to the counter and we were the only table there. So, we made the order.   There was no bread or what so  ever while we were waiting for the meal (which is very unusual for an argentina restaurant). We waited for the meal for about an hour. My friends and I were starving!. we ordered a parrillada para dos, empanadas, and argentina steak. The steak was soso. there was nothing special about the steak and the parrillada. The only thing that had argentina taste was the bbq sauce.   However, here is the important part. I wanted to ordered more hot water. my boyfriend called the waitress a million of time and she did not response to him. so I turned my head to the counter (i was sitting right besides the counter and the waitress was in the counter doing some thing ). I called her again. but she did not response, she kept doing on whatever she was doing. The guy that was sitting close to the table told the waitress in spanish that we were calling her. and guess what the waitress said! She said \"ay, que espere\". Which means let them wait. hello!!!! is that the attitude of a waitress??   By the way, the waitress did not know I speak spanish and I and my friends are all Chinese. I would not go back to this restaurant again. isn't service the first impression of a restaurant.   I always thought that Chinese are bad at serving, but I guess we are not the only. (We were very polite with her). when we left, we even get her the amount of tips that we should give."}
{"text":"Food is alright, atmosphere is awesome! The service is prompt, food can take a bit to arrive as everything is freshly made and on the spot! Go weekend evening for dinner and you'll be treated to live band singing anything from Spanish songs to American classics. I was pleasantly surprised! It's great for groups! If you enjoy a good dance after dinner is a great spot!"}
{"text":"If it's not the black guy from South America who is cooking don't eat that day"}
{"text":"I was there several months ago with my daughters who are very picky with the food and I have to say they loved it. The best parrilladas ever very tasty, nice people good service, My daughter loves the entra√±a, definitely We have to go back  ."}
{"text":"The 12 oz steak was more like 8 oz but besides that the dinner was decent and the service good. Chicken with mushrooms was ok and the mixed salad was good. So overall the food was pretty good and the prices fair.  Although... we left before the band came on and maybe that's when the place gets busy and the service drops. Looked like there were only 1 or 2 servers on a Sat. night,so I can see how the service could slow down. I would come back for a lunch steak sandwich if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Sky Ranch Restaurant was my first experience of Argentina restaurant. They grilled beef with only salt and they were tasty. I tried beef and sausage. They are delicious.  I like the atmosphere and many customers are Argentineans. You can enjoy real Argentinean culture in Toronto there."}
{"text":"Went with a friends...No empanadas - sold out....ordered flank steak, got meat with a bones, fatty and very dry. Friends ordered MIX GRILL - no blood sausage, chorizo  like italian sweet sausage. Very OVERPRICE, especially sangria and appetizers as portion are very small. I've been in Argentina couple times and I can tell taste of  this restaurant is FAR from argentinian food."}
{"text":"A genuine family orientated Argentinian experience from the delicious meat dishes to the dulce leche, Sky Ranch is a great place for everyone. The interior and service are warm and accommodating.  Definitely recommended if you want to try a Argentinian bbq without paying the crazy prices of the other Argentinian restaurants in town.  It's a little out of the way public transport wise but well worth the trip."}
{"text":"When we walked in, I felt like we were interrupting a private party. There was one large table with a family sitting there with at least two kids running around. We stood there awkwardly waiting to be noticed. Finally we were told to sit anywhere.    We looked at the menu online before getting there so we had an idea of what we wanted for lunch. The menu that we got wasn't at all the same as what we saw online. It seemed like almost all of the employees were tending to the table that had the family there, so my bf and I sat there, exchanging glances while admiring the grossly dated decor. When we finally for a waitress, we inquired about difference in menu. We found out that they had given us the dinner menu. It's 2pm...why are you giving me the dinner menu?  Anyhow, our server came and took our order...and reconfirmed what we had just said no less than 3 times. She saw my bf and I look at each other like...\"what the hell..?\" Then she said she just wanted to make sure she got it right.   Then...the food came...and Omg it was gross. Chopped sirloin? It looked like wet ground beef formed into an oval on my plate...and it had a very unsettling flavour. The mashed potatoes were just that-mashed potatoes. No butter, no garlic, no nothing. Just plain potatoes. My bf got some sort of breakfast sandwich with steak and eggs in it. The steak was embarrassingly overcooked...he was swinging his head from side to side in an attempt to break a bite sized piece of the meat into his mouth. When the owner noticed us, my bf was honest and said everything was pretty awful. She said that it was because it wasn't her son back there cooking our food. First of all..it probably WAS her son back there. And if it wasn't...who are you hiring to cook your food?   Anyhow, she apologized and asked us not to pay. I told my bf to just pay the bill (it was about $25) and we would chalk it up to a lesson learned. We always drive by this place and have always wanted to try it...yikes."}
{"text":"Really a no frills type of place to eat. Not a place you would take someone to impress with regard to decor, but it is good eats.  Recently had lunch there. Great value. For 9.95 you get steak with your choice of sides. I had steak, eggs, and potatoes.   The food is good. The service in my experience is both fast and polite. Quite often the owner is there and he will make sure you are happy.  Also, try their soups. Very good."}
{"text":"I was excited to visit this establishment as they advertise steak and my favourite dish, paella. I should have listened to my wife, as she could smell the fish from 30 feet away. It was a disappointment, as it was bland, soggy, like overdone stew of what I am not sure of. My stomach is still upset.Once is enough."}
{"text":"Located on a busy street, just off of Dufferin, but not exactly the most ideal location for a restaurant.    Ordered the parillada para dos.  This consists of barbecued skirt steak (my favourite!), chorizo, beer ribs and chicken.  It also has blood and kidney sausage but we substituted it for more skirt steak.  We chose the potato salad as a side.    The waitress brings over a portable camping stove over to your table and places the dish on the burner.  My guess is, from the looks of the meat presented before us, is that it is partially cooked and then you are left to cook the rest on your table.    The skirt steak is simply delish.  Deserves two stars at least as part of my review. The chorizo was yummy, as I've never tried it before.  Beef ribs were okay, as was the potato salad.   Now, the chicken... What chicken? I thought at first my piece was undercooked so I thre it back on the grill.  Thought it was cooked after awhile and cut into it to simply find an entire piece of fat! Just fat.  No meat to be found. Got a nibble of the other piece that consisted mostly of bones.   Que Rica la bola de grassa y huesos!?  This all came at the price of around $46.00.    Mind you we order bottles of juice for $2.75 and they were the cheapie ones you can buy the whole case for about the same price.   What killed me even more was the server answered her phone when serving customers at the table behind us.  Oh my.   Came up to $58.65 in total. Wow. At least I was full, but I don't like so much drama with my meal.   Next time I will just buy the skirt steak from the butcher and cook it at home myself."}
{"text":"This is one of the few Argentine restaurant in town. The Casa Mendoza on the Lakeshore was one, but it has now become expensive casual dining.  I had lunch there, to assess this place. The steak special they offered, was a skirt steak (one of my favourites), with fries, vegetables and salad. The price was under $ 10.00 for over 8 oz. of meat which is a great price.  The steak was good, the fries tasty, and the salad alright. The decor is extremely dated, and the pictures you can find online give a much better impression. This is not a place to take a date. They have varied the menu, added breakfast, but have strayed pretty far from their roots.  I would return for lunch anytime."}
{"text":"We've been here several years ago, and the first thing we notice are the torn and worn chairs. This is indicative of all at Sky Ranch, a place that appears to be in a dire need of updating. The only thing that has been updated are the prices, which seem punitive for what you receive.   Salt. Salt seems to be used to mask rubbery flank steak and boned riddled salmon with a sad side of mashed potatoes. Please don't look at the chicken covered with American processed cheese slices and ham taken out of a Junior High school cafeteria.   Why does Sky Ranch disrespect its food and its customers by handing out day old bread from bags and forcing them to sit on worn out furniture? Perhaps this is why, in a Saturday night, empty tables littered the small place.  The saving grace was the three piece band and beautiful salsa and other melodies which got everyone dancing. This earned the second star. If you do go, please order plenty of water and drink even more when you go home and the sodium will overflow your internal organs through the next morning.  -RZ"}
{"text":"This one will be short and sweet.  :-) Went with a couple friends, ordered the massive meat platter.. Everything was cooked very well, the meats were delicious, not recommended for vegetarians ;-)  The atmosphere definitely gives you a \"ranch\" feeling, and the staff there were nice, polite, and gave us great service!"}
{"text":"I was really happy to come to this place, My husband first talked to Christina the owner over the phone and she was super sweet and gave us all the information that we needed of what they have. We got to the restaurant and she was the nicest ever she made us feel welcome and like part of the family, so warm with all of the customers. They have big portions, wooohoooooo and the food is really good, my husband keep saying that it was just like back home. I really like it and the prices are really good. The best of all is this wonderful family running tye restaurant make u feel at home. I will come back more often and let all my friends know. Love it!"}
{"text":"Finally I found an Argentinian Restaurant!!!! Though the name of this place DOES NOT SOUND ARGENTINIAN, dont judge a book by its cover.  Stumbled here for a late breakfast in the quaint, cowboy, rodeo themed joint.  Our party decided to order the typical Argentinian super breakfast Bisteca, papa fritas, con huevos! Steak, fries, and eggs which came with their homemade bbq sauce.  The service, the portions, and the steak were perfecto! But what was really yummy was their 'de postre' (dessert); HOMEMADE strawberry cheesecake was 9/10, their flan con caramel was 8.5/10.  Aside from the food, the atmosphere is warm, with all its wooden fixtures, bar, and a little area where they feature live music on Saturdays so make reservations.  I will definitely be back otra vece (again) Only thing is that this place is situated in a plaza with LIMITED ....LIMITED parking"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife, kids and my parents for my birthday dinner in March 2013. Am a huge Argentino in heart (even tho my background is El Salvador) so I always died to come here for the BBQ. Since we always been bbq the  entra√±a.   To be honest way over priced for the amount of food you get and drink. The only thing that looked filling was the burgers and the meat. My wife got pasta and it wasnt that great. The lady dont get me wrong was nice, decor felt like you were in Argentina Steak house. Thats about it they had speakers really loud on wouldnt of mind if it was spanish music but it was hardcore rap kinda hard to have a 6 year old and 3months old listing to that music. My son orders dessert the weird part was she said they didnt know if they had it. She went to the back and comes back says no to almost everything of dessert so he gets ice cream. The ice cream was that no name. Paying that kind of money for no name ice cream come on. After her dropping of the dessert she never came back to the table we were just waiting along time to the bill.  The website was never updated so it was cheaper seeing it online.  So like I said am a big Argentino in heart I gave it another shot a full year later for breakfast this time. They have a big black banner infront of the store saying breakfeast special 9.99 you get 3eggs potatoes and a big steak. So my wife went to buy it asked for the speical they said o the price is 15.99 we havent changed the banner. My wife says well that's false advertising that they should honor whats there. This lady had the balls to say they didnt change it because of the ice storm. My wife said the ice storm happend in December. Either way shes there so she bought it for 3 of us.   That was the last straw for this place I can buy the same meat they use for 20bucks and everything would come out cheaper.    If your gonna go just be prepared"}
{"text":"Small but clean and beautiful. A big steak for just 25-30$ . Really delicious. Customer service excellent. The owner was a respectful lady. Every thing excellent"}
{"text":"What establishment serves PRE COOKED CHICKEN along with  grilled  skirt steak. sausage tibs and blood sausage? ????? Skyranch does. Small portions to boot as if grudgingly admitting that they do.. indeed have to serve more than chicken and sausage they have advertised,? You may trick people who've never had descent( not even mentioning awesome or original here) parrillada.  It looks like a money grab... greed never wins over quality and quantity. Hopefully one day people will catch on."}
{"text":"I went to Sky Ranch for breakfast to watch a World Cup match. First, I noticed that the place is much smaller than it appears in the photos. However, the breakfast was very reasonably priced at 10 dollars for Argentinean steak, hash browns, eggs and a fruit salad. The steak (cooked to order) was very good accompanied by the homemade chimichurri, but the fruit salad was pre-packaged in a plastic takeout container with a plastic spoon and seemed a few days old. The service was decent, but can be poor at times based on my husband's previous visits."}
{"text":"2.5-3* but approximately 2/3 stars is for the live entertainment on Saturday night. I visited Sky Ranch with the family recently, and what really drew us in was the live South American band that had everyone in the restaurant dancing! The place as packed with families and kids, and it was nice to feel such a warm ambiance in an otherwise dead corner of the city.  The service was not the worst, but also nothing to write home about. We had to signal a few times to ask for water, bill etc!  The food was also ok, but I've had much better. Their specialty is steak, and I guess this is the safest/only bet. The T-bone steak was tender and juicy, but doesn't really make the cut for me. Maybe their flank steak is the way to go.  Veal cutlet seemed deep fried and was not great either. I also tried the rolled stuffed beef/chicken or Metambre De Carne o Pollo. Sounds good right?! Wrong! This cold appetizer tasted worst than canned meat! Stay away from this one! Overall a very fun atmosphere if you want to dance or for kids, but I would not go for the food."}
{"text":"Sky Ranch Restaurant is one of the best Latin American restaurants in town.   The restaurant is small but cozy. I've heard some complaints about the restaurant being a little dated but I think it perfectly captures the charm of Argentina.  We went on a Saturday night at about 9pm. There was live music when we came in. The place was packed and we didn't have a reservation. There was one open table and the waitress was able to accommodate us. So if you want a good table, remember to call ahead.  The menu features Argentinian favorites (Asado, Churrasco, Pasta) and some borrowed dishes such as Paella. Prices range between $8.99 to $40.00 for the main course. Some dishes such as the Asado and Paella feed two or more people.  We ordered Pan con Ajo (garlic bread) as an appetizer and the Parillada (Beef Ribs, Brisket, Chicken, Sausage, Blood Sausage, Sweet Bread) as an entree. The Parillada for one is a lot of food and can easily feed two people.  The service was very attentive and friendly though slow. The food took more than an hour but the wait was well worth it. By the time we got our food, the band was playing Latin music and couples were dancing. The Asado was delicious.  The meat was very tender and juicy.  The bill came up to $67.00 which included an appetizer, main course, and four glasses of wine.  Great food, great people, great times!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try the food from this place but unfortunately I could not because of the service.  I came in around 7pm in the evening and waited to be seated.  The waitress ignored me, so I assumed that you have to seat yourself.  The funny thing is that there was one table being served and there were 2 waitresses.  I waited 10 minutes for one of the waitresses to serve me but one of them was busy talking to the one table they have served (a family that was done eating their food) and the other one was at the bar.  I waited another 5 minutes to be served but nobody came so I just left the restaurant.    Luckily, there was a shawarma place across the street and I just ate there instead.   Overall, service really really really really really sucks.  First time I have ever been ignored when going to a restaurant.  I should have read the reviews before trying this place.  Lesson learned."}
