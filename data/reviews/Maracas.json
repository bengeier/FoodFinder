{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Worked there for about two weeks shortly after they had opened, they refused to pay us servers saying we were working for tips until they got the computer system payroll up and running (lies), food was thrown together with no thought behind it, very low quality food, don't have half of the things they have on their menu ready to order.. beautiful location and decor but horrible management, HORRIBLE, beware of Mentor, Ohio's Maraca's!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Maracas a few weeks ago with my son.  I was very dissapointed in the crab cakes the mixture was pulverized and it was all breading.  When I picture crabcakes I want to see all seafood and very little breading.  The waitress acted as though we were intruding on her time and schoolwork as she never stopped by the table, forgot the catsup we so asked for over and over again.  My son ordered the steak and fries and was very pleased with his selection.  This place has alot of potential I only hope the owners see this and try and turn it around."}
{"text":"The food is to die for! I so love the conch chowder. The place is very, very clean and everyone is so nice! There is great entertainment on the weekends with the areas best rock bands and events during the week too! Its probably the best rockin joint in mentor!"}
