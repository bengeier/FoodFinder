{"text":"Since the Greek guy who owned this place sold it to the owners of Involtini next door the quality and taste has gone totally downhill. We use to order the baked spaghetti and lasagna all the time and the pizza occasionally, but the quality of the food and the attitude of the service has kept us away. We're done here."}
{"text":"First off let me begin by saying I am very picky when it comes to pizza. I have spent the last 5 years, taste testing over 68 Pizzerias all over the city, trying to find Calgary's best pizza. 

I honestly have to say that this was definitely in the top 10 and easily the best in SW Calgary. 

Flavorful sauce, buttery crust, quality toppings and excellent blend of cheese. I do not know the owners and this was my first time here, so no biased review from me. I can't believe I haven't heard of it before and no one else has left a review...What a gem. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Calgary!  The family special pizza is the best they have. Soooo good. They are far from me. We will drive across Calgary to get our pizza here it's so good. We love it."}
