{"text":"Really good pizza and fries! & panini! Super big portions and cheap! I always order delivery here and they are always early which is amazing! Will be ordering lots!"}
{"text":"Great food! Service isn't wonderful, but it isnt billed as such. Food is totally reasonable, tasty, and well prepared."}
{"text":"VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. I called ahead of time to place my order for pick up. When I arrived my pizza was not ready yet.  As I was waiting, another customer walked in and ordered the same exact pizza and received his order before I did. When I complained that I had ordered well ahead of him and questioned why he would get his order first, I was given tons of excuses, none of which made any sense whatsoever, and absolutely no apologies. When I reiterated that they have terrible customer service and that I would not be returning, I was once again given invalid excuses as to why he was served first and no attempts to rectify the situation! If they would like to keep their customers, they need to learn how to manage their orders properly and have some integrity when they mess up.  We have gone here a number of times and this experience has completely ruined it for me.  We do not plan to ever go back here!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd expand my pizza choices to other than the major ones. Try local all I got was burnt pizza that was all dough and drips of sauce. To make matters worse I called the store and the guy seemed to not care and was rude. All in all poor service and the worst pizza ever. 

Stay clear of this place."}
{"text":"This place is dirty and the service is super slow. It took us almost 15 minutes to even order a shawarma and there was only one person in front of us. 
The place just has this sketchy vibe to it (dimly lit) 
The woman who served us was also very ruse considering how much money we spent. 
Shawarma was mediocre at best. Have not tried the pizza so can only comment on the shawarma. 
Would not recommend"}
{"text":"Local hole in the wall pizza and shawarma place. Very well priced and good quality. I usually get the shawarma (2 for 1 special) . It is turkish styled shawarma with great topping selection. Their pizza's are well made. Just beware that this place is not the classiest pizzeria in the city, and you will guaranteed find some of the local neighbourhood drunks hanging around in the store. They dont bother anybody, just there since there is no local bar in that area."}
{"text":"Extremely slow, I went to school around here also and very slow and sometimes kinda rude. Years ago we also found bugs and what not crawling up the walls and stuff and of course it has gotten cleaner but still. Overall the service is extremely slow, the shawarma lady took her time making her friends shawarma by talking to her about random crap but at the same time taking her time actually making the food. Like people want food and to leave, but the food is pretty good. If you're looking for a quick place to eat, this is not the place."}
{"text":"We live nearby and I enjoy bringing my daughter there for a pizza (ask for a fresh one, not a slice that's been sitting there all day). Depending on who is cooking it, the dough is sometimes a little undercooked, but overall, I'm very satisfied with service and quality. One time, my pizza was a little burnt and they took the initiative to make me a new one without waiting for me to ask for it. My personal favorite is the shawarma with everything on top. It's truly a great one. Their fries are nice, but seem to be frozen. Finally, the staff is friendly. Overall, it's fast food and it's nothing fancy, but I gave it four stars because that's exactly what they are trying to be, a humble local establishment that wins over the community with simple and good dishes and at that game, they won me and my family."}
{"text":"Fast, hot delivery.  Best wings in Toronto. Hands down. Fresh veggies are crisp and cold. Super delivery guys. great value!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight for dinner,  it came quick and was very delicious.  I had 10 medium sauce chicken wings  and small French fries.   My husband  had the Lasagna.   He was quite happy with the taste, and the chicken wings were perfect and the fries weren't covered in a layer of salt.  The lasagna was $5.99, the wings $6.99 and the small fries $2.36 but there was plenty of them.  A delivery charge of $3.00 from JUST EAT.ca,  a 10% tip for the driver and HST of $2.38.  Total,  $22.55.   A bit pricey, but the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Waited to order and the staff were arguing and went behind the doors and when they fi ally came out they asked the customer behind me for their order... it was very strange... they said i was there 1st and they still ignored me... maybe they thought i was a student but i was so turned off by this behaviour i left and will refuse to go again. The worst showcase of service i have ever experienced"}
{"text":"Ordered on here from Just Eat when we got tired of our regular pizza place. Can I just say that this is the most amazing tasting pizza... ever! It's seriously amazing! We've ordered there a bunch of times now, over the phone too. I wonder how much they paid to get that number! 4162220222! I mean seriously?! :D"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a four stars for the quality of their food.
Their pizzas are delicious and inexpensive compared to what you would pay at Pizza Nova or even Pizza Pizza. A large deluxe pizza can cost you $15.00 and you get three sodas or your chose or sauces. The only thing that I would like to see is them including pizzas with the cheese crusts but that might be too fancy for a place like this.

Having said that, I would give them two stars for their establishment. Every time that I go there to pick up my pizza, I see the same guys sitting around drinking and being loud and they completely ruin the atmosphere. If the owner is reading this, please ban these people or put a limit on alcohol purchases so that we can eat our food in peace because until then I am always going to take my food to go.

Cheers!

{"text":"I always come to this place to buy shawarma sandwiches and usually the service is good.  Unfortunately, there was a new sandwich maker and she was really something...  I asked for a falafel dinner and she tells me that there are no more falafel available... only chicken.. (it was 6:30pm).  I got upset at her tone and so I just order a caesar salad for my girlfriend.  The gentlemen that took my order did not pay attention to what I said about adding extra chicken and 25 minutes later my caesar salad was ready.  I didnt know it took 25 minutes to make a caesar salad without the chicken and bacon bits (it was missing).  In addition,  another customer walked in, a white gentlemen, he ordered a falafel sandwich and the lady agreed to make his sandwich but replied to him in a really rude fashion...  It really sucks that this place is hiring people who dont want to even give good service to customers..  I will not be coming back... fix your service and treat your customers right because we are the ones paying your paycheques."}
