{"text":"Excellent food and love the staff.  You can't go wrong here.  As soon as you walk in the door you receive a friendly and joyful hello - you feel like you're home.   The chef is working hard in the kitchen but not to busy to offer you a small sample of home made soup made fresh daily.  I swear, if he wasn't the burrito king he would be the soup nazi - \"no soup for you\".  If your passing by this small Eglinton Avenue plaza you should drop in for taste of Mexico regardless of where you're from."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite place for burritos in all of Toronto and Mississauga. The fish burrito with wasabu aioli is to die for. The fish is crispy, the sauce with the perfect kick from the wasabi.   The service is exceptionally good. The owner and his team are super nice, courteous and full of care from the moment you step in.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So yummy! I have been a fat bastard faithful for quite some time but I have found a new burrito to love at Caliente. The toppings are so fresh and delicious, the meat/seafood options are plentiful,  and the homemade sauces are just icing on the cake. Everything can be made as either a burrito, quesidilla or salad.. all for the same price. Amazing.  My only feedback would be to offer different sizes for the burritos and add guac to the topping options. Stop what you're doing and go get one now!"}
{"text":"What are you waiting for?  This place is amazing. The food is incredibly fresh and delicious (and the size of those burritos...) The service is fast and the employees are welcoming.  i can eat here every day!"}
{"text":"Everything was Good, burrito made exactly how I wanted it and the price was good. Also got a sample of the soup of the day potato and spinach which was yummy."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place for burritos! Loved the sauces and the chicken was full of flavour.  Ingredient was fresh as well. Will definitely go back again. Why a 4 star though? Well they somewhat cheapened out on the meat. They don't give much meat and they also use lower quality of meat. For a Chicken burrito I would prefer it be white meat and not red meat."}
{"text":"I was never a texmex fan, but boy, did this place ever change me!!!!  Flavours are not too spicy. Key differences between  Caliente and other burrito places: 1. Their burrito shells are  lightly toasted to enhance the flavour and to lock moisture inside the ingredients. 2. The ingredients are very well  seasoned and marinaded.  The features are beef, pulled pork, halal chicken, shrimp, and tofu.  Tried their spinach soup and was very  well blended and loaded with flavours and  veggies.   Portions are very generous.  Very clean place.  LGBTQ-friendly bathrooms.  Free WiFi.  They serve  breakfast now at  7am. They also do catering.  Owners Harry and Connie are super friendly.  Culinary experts from George Brown, they may be coming out with more choices in the new year."}
{"text":"So I just found out about this place on the weekend, and grabbed burritos there with a friend tonight and WOW...just wow! They have the usual toppings that every other place has, as well as their meat/veg fillings. I tried the chorizo sausage and it was delicious! Very flavourful, saucy and filling! They only have one size (probably comparable to the \"large\" at Fat B's). Burrito alone, taxes in, it came to $10.  While we waited, they gave us a sample of their daily soup - it was very yummy! The staff was super friendly from the moment we stepped in to the moment we left.  I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Comparable to our beloved friends at Burrito Boyz - with a little extra latin flare.    The food here is great and worthy of 5 stars.  They carry a unique array on house-made sauces that really separate this place from the rest of their competition.  The meat is very flavourful (more than other places) and the toppings are always fresh and otherwise the same as every other burrito place.  They also carry some home-made soups which I got to sample today and will be a regular place to visit during those cold winter months.    The food is great...the prices are spot on...and the owner seems like a good guy as well.  My only reason for giving this place 4 stars is that the seating leaves more to be desired (in fairness - it's still better than most of the competition including BBs).    I will be coming back...for those of you who work in the area...another great lunch option in an area with already too many great lunch options.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"As part of my team's Friday lunch outing, we came here. There were five of us. My manager drove over here from his home after taking a series of conference calls in the morning. I drove my colleagues over to this restaurant.  It's located in a plaza where there are a bunch of eateries. There is also a DriveTest office, which makes me cringe to be entering a parking lot full of worried wannabe licensed drivers.  We went in and were immediately greeted by a number of Chinese folks. It is a cheerful Cantonese-speaking group.  I ordered the chicken bowl, which consists of rice and beans, and any fresh toppings that you desire. Naturally, I needed corn, but also added other goodies. I went with the chipotle sauce. It has a slight kick to it. I also ordered a cream soda.  If you want guacamole, it is an extra $2. The place also sells beer. Seating is limited.  Since were were the largest group there, our meals were brought to us. It was a nice touch.  I enjoyed my chicken bowl. All ingredients were fresh and tasty.  Our group was mixed as far as opinions go. My manager and another colleague weren't impressed. They have been to a number of burrito places and probably have higher expectations than the rest of us. The rest of us found our meals to be tasty.  This place has a card stamp program. If you order ten times, your next order is free. I will need to look at my card more carefully, as I have yet to read the fine print. I will definitely come back here and figure it out.  (248)"}
{"text":"Omg! This is so close to home and their burritos are so yummy..way better than burrito boyz.   I have gone there twice and got pulled pork and steak. Both were delicious. Both times I went I was given a free soup sample while they made my burrito. The soups are really flavorful and you can tell a seasoned chef has made them.  The staff is so friendly, they also offer loyalty cards which I of course took. They're going to be seeing a lot of me hehe  The burritos are good and fresh , the flavour of the meat really stands out. They aren't cheap with their toppings either. All in all..love this place!"}
{"text":"For $9.35 you can get a burrito, bowl with a choice of meat, chicken or fish. I ordered the chorizo bowl.   The sauce is alright and the seasoning on the meat was bit intense. Also, sausage was oily which made the dish a bit unappealing. I am giving this place an extra star because the staff were really friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food! My husband is from Mexico and he LOVED it! Girlfriend and I had the vegetariano, her husband had Pescado Frito and my husband had Carne de res"}
