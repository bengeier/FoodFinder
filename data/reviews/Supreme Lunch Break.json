{"text":"Philly cheese steak sandwich. These folks are quick when all you have is 30min to eat and get back to work. Nice comfortable and friendly environment. I go here at the very least once a week. Go!!!"}
{"text":"Typical breakfast/lunch cafe tucked away in a business plaza oriented to fast convenient lunch for working stiffs who need to grab a quick bite and get back to to a job.  Fast service. I never have to worry about getting back to work on time when I go here.   Food is very basic. Mainly sandwiches and chips and soda.   Portion sizes are a bit smaller here. Positive spin: \"Just the right size to keep me going for the afternoon while not weighing me down.\" Negative spin: \"Gee, there's sure not much meat on this sandwich and there's only tomato on one half.\"  If you're very hungry you probably want to visit the Arizona Sandwich Company down the street instead.   Drink refill's must be paid for, and I regularly get way too much ice in my first drink. Too often I leave thirsty because I don't want to pay for the refill.  There's a nice patio outside to get some fresh air with your lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing food, large menu, fast and friendly service! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I work around the corner.  Very good menu selection and variety. Salads are always made fresh. Everything is prepared fast. Never a long wait time.  5 stars every time I been thru there."}
{"text":"I really cannot understand how a burger and fries could taste this bad. For 9 bucks I expected much more. The fries taste freezer burnt and the ketchup is not heinz. I feel worse now than when I was starving. Just avoid it."}
{"text":"I came across this place via restaurant.com and since it is near my office I decided to try it out. I have been here multiple times in the last few weeks and so far everything that I have tried has been good. I've tried the turkey sandwich, the blt, the hot pastrami, which are all very good, but I think my favorite is the chicken salad. They also have daily specials including a chicken teriyaki meal with rice and vegetables that I really like. Service is great and the food is always prepared quickly. I often pick up lunch for other co workers as well and this has become one of our go to spots that is now on our weekly rotation. So if you're in the area and looking for a quick lunch for a very affordable price, give it a try, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"First time here!  Great homemade food and super nice people helping me.  I will definitely be back! The portions are huge!  So come hungry!"}
{"text":"I eat lunch here all the time. They have a wide variety of menu items so you can eat something different everyday, although I usually get the same things but the food is always great! The people that work there are super friendly and get your food to you asap."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is near my office and I go here at least once a week. They have everything. I usually call in a breakfast burrito on my way in and swing by before the office. My order is always ready and correct. You can tell the employees love what they do because they are always so friendly. The service is great. They also have fantastic Indian food and all for a good price. Highly recommend. :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a French dip sub from this location off of grub hub. I waited 20 minutes after the estimated delivery time and called. The girl said he was leaving now. After another hour (the location is only 4-5 minutes from my apartment) I called again. I got a different lady this time and she proceeded to tell me how the delivery guy had came and went without ever finding my place. I asked why they didn't call or use the map at the front entrance of my complex like every other delivery guy does. She lied and said they did call and made it sound like it was my fault the delivery guy doesn't have the sense to use the phone or a map. She then stated that since my food was already ready that it would only be a couple of minutes. I told her that she better not be planning on bringing me the same food they made for me 2 hours ago and told her she better make new. She said okay and hung up on me. Low and behold the delivery guy shows up and my cold coffee was warm and my French dip was cold. They actually brought me food that had been sitting around for 2 hours even after I told them I didn't want it. This place needs either new management or they need to step in and see what their employees are selling customers. Wont be calling this place again."}
{"text":"This is just a little sandwich shop that's located in my work's business park. It really doesn't look like much from the outside, but I haven't had anything here that wasn't good yet. They have daily specials that have a huge variety, they deliver to close by businesses, and they have the BEST BACON. The burgers are mediocre, but it you get bacon it, it makes it amazing. Their breakfast burritos are pretty solid too.   Not a great date spot, but a nice place if you're looking for a quick and easy lunch at work."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place today in my Yelp search and I'm very happy I did.  Supreme Lunch Break is within a 5 min drive from my office and offers plenty of parking which is big for me; I hate it when a place shares a lot and you spend 5 mins just trying to get a spot.  The restaurant offers a variety of food with breakfast options until 11 then anything from soups/sandwiches to carne asada burritos to chicken tikka.  The food is fresh and the service is friendly.  I had the chicken tikka today and it was amazing.  It had just the right amount of heat and the portion was ridiculously big so the value for your dollar is on point.   I will be making future trips back to Supreme Lunch Break.  Next time I hope to save room for a custom espresso drink."}
{"text":"I'm a new tenant in this business park.  Had a few meals there and I'm very impressed with the freshness of the foods provided.  It's exactly what I'd want in a quick business lunch.  And for only $1, they'll deliver to my office suite--can't beat their service!  The food is quite good--it's basically a good deli with some convenience-store type foods.  I'm very happy they're in this park!  It must have been pretty good for some time, as they've been in business in that location for nearly 30 years!"}
{"text":"Supreme Lunch Break is out of this world! They are in my work plaza which makes it super convenient and they have quality food for great prices. And they deliver!!!"}
{"text":"They used tough chewy chicken on the chicken quesadilla. I felt slightly nauseous after eating  it. First and last time I go there!"}
