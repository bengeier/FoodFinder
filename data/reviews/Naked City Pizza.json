{"text":"Ryan, who I just met at their new El Cortez shop, is a stranger to my friend and I...I swear.   We just loved the meatball sub (half normal, half light parm $10.95) so much that it may feel as if we were paid or compensated somehow to give this review on his behalf-since he took our order and chased me thru the casino to deliver our order hot..We were not compensated  AND , we definitely wouldn't need prodding or compensation of any sort to eat here again. My bestie and I dining are admittedly piggies, and he is admittedly a picky Piggy, but we happiLy split the meatball sub and both felt that we had sandwiches too big for either of us.  I loved my half that felt like a whole sandwich, bc the meat smelled and tasted like a super fresh cut of gyro meat; and my dining bestie , when prodded, said \"its hard to explain but it,like, melts on my tongue and all of it is my favorite part.\"  This is the happiest outlay of cash downtown for food or entertainment My bestie and I have ever put down, ever. Both of us could have easily handed a third of our halves of the same sandwich to a third party and still been stuffed. Definitly bypass anything under the lights Downtown and scramble the extra block to The Naked City at the El Cortez. We will again, defiNitly!"}
{"text":"Stopped by looking for Pizza Lotto and found Naked City has taken over the space. Always happy to try a new spot, but the pizza just wasn't very good. Not sure what all the hype is about. I ordered a slice of classic cheese, which was very dry, overly doughy, and had almost no sauce. Also it was a corner piece of a rectangular pie, so about a third of it was crust. Maybe I just caught them on a bad day, but the quality of the product I tried rivaled that of a high school cafeteria."}
{"text":"Naked City Pizza is probably one of the best places to get a slice of delicious red sauce cheesy pie! If you're feeling unconventional, they have a variety of unique flavors with twists on their menu.   They also have their own homemade desserts which I have yet to try. So far I've only tried the Naked City Pizza; and that was really tasty!  Customer service at this place is an A+. Employees served with a smile and gave me input on what their favourite slice was including what was the most popular item on the menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza spot at the end of Fremont St inside the El Cortez Casino. Prices are very reasonable for large slices of pizza. Nice quiet atmosphere with a few TVs to watch sports while you eat. Service is good."}
{"text":"They replaced another pizza spot in the El Cortez. It isn't thin slice anymore. It's more of a handheld bread with sauce and toppings on top. It's too thick for me to be better than mediocre."}
{"text":"Ok, pizza is very doughy and I believe it took me 20 minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. Honestly, go to Evil Pie and your experience will be better."}
{"text":"I do think this is the best pizza in Las Vegas , if you like pizza from Buffalo New York this is so close"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza not greasy wonderful crust outstanding customer service felt east Coast style, parking sucks but well worth it a must go to"}
{"text":"The hubby and I have been frequenting the original Naked City Pizza inside Moondoggies for years - it's always been our go to for pizza night - so I was beyond thrilled when we found this happy little gem inside El Cortez! It's bigger than Moondoggies and we easily found a nice comfy spot looking out into the casino.  The quality and service was so great that there's no need for awesome decor, although the vintage black and white photos lining the wall were a nice touch. We ordered a half pan (12 square cut slices) of pepperoni but they also had a by-the-slice special that was accompanied by a beer. There were also subs available and the calzone I saw at another table almost prompted me to order one for later.  One day I want to save room for the desserts because they look absolutely scrumptious! Bottom line: We're definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is gross. Went there to grab a slice with my boyfriend and was served lukewarm (almost tasted old) pizza. The crust isn't that good. Maybe it would've been better if it was fresh and heated properly. I wouldn't go out of my way to pay for pizza from here again."}
{"text":"I was rather surprised by this place. Decent elementary school style rectangular pizza, but the mommas meatball is friggin delicious. Would definitely go back here."}
{"text":"Just had the Bugsy's Bianco and Back Home pizza and I am impressed. This place is close to my house and I will now declare this place as my go-to pizza joint. I'm not from NY where the best pizza is made, but I absolutely love this place.   The whole pies, from what I ordered, are rectangular in shape and sliced into 9 slices. The dough seems like a great vessel for the toppings, which I absolutely dig. Quality is pretty good. I am planning on trying all their specialty pies.  NOTE: I've noticed when this place is busy, I assume the pizza isn't in the oven as long and the crust isn't as crispy as some of the other times I've visited when it wasn't busy.  Never had a cannoli in my life. They seem on the smaller side, I think, but nonetheless they are magnificent. Definitely will go back for cannolis.  In the words of Arnold, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Non traditional style pizza . Pizza taste great . Atmosphere is a little dull. But service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"The Naked City Pizza Shop is one of my favorite pizza places in Las Vegas. There pizzas are super tasty with a unique twist. The customer service is excellent. There are super polite and courteous.  My favorite pizza are the Naked City Pizza, the Guinea Pie Pizza and the Fremont Street Pizza. The homemade desserts here are exceptional. I really crave the German Chocolate Cake and the Oreo cake. It's truly to die for. Super clean environment. Yes, I'm going to be a regular here from now on."}
{"text":"We loved this little hole in a wall, inside a casino, pizza joint. The kids loved the pizza and the crust was amazing. The waitress working at the time was amazing. She interacted well with the adults and even better with the kids. She even located a high chair for us to use. We will definitely be coming back! Oh and the ranch dressing!  Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza shop run by some of the most talented guys in the business! I'll be back many times."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Worth the extra steps to El Cortez to get these slices. Had the hot dog today too and it was worth it. Never disappoints"}
{"text":"This is your average chain pizza. I wasn't very impressed with it. The crust is chewy and greasy, and the cheese and sauce reminds me of something you would find at a bowling alley. At least the slices are pretty big and a good value for the money. If you're dying for some grub it ain't bad, but nothing special."}
{"text":"WE visited the Naked City Pizza on freemont street,downtown,they have a large selection of varietys of different pizzas,there is only ONE SIZE of a complete pizza,we choose the \"REBEL\" the prices are the same for different selections,about $25.00 for a pie,a little on the high side we thought,without drink costs,square pizza,takes about 20 minutes to make one,it may be considered very large for just 2 people,and we are lightweight,but the 2 of us managed to eat all but 3 slices,it was very good,not the best we have ever eaten,but very good,there was just the 2 of us sitting down at the time(noon) the waitress/pizza maker?? was very polite and courteous,i don't think she expected us to down almost an entire pie,the crust was very good,its a thicker style pizza so there is more of it,we have eaten pizza from Los Angeles to New York City,it was quite good,we only stopped there to eat just the one time as they have other food to offer,check it out next time your downtown,but you might want to have 4 people for a complete pie...."}
{"text":"The Naked City outlet in the El Cortez is where their coffee shop used to be.  7 adults and 2 children met here for Saturday brunch.  We started with a classic shrimp cocktail for $1.99 following a tradition on Fremont Street.  Following this, we had cherry tomato and mozzarella sticks with pesto sauce which was soon followed by a huge tray that had stromboli cut into slices.  The stromboli crust was thin and the filling very good.  Few do red sauce as well as Naked City.  Then came two \"Grandma's meatballs\"--a pound and a half each served with shredded cheese and some grilled bread.  Grandma knew how to feed a family.  Next came two subs--a chicken parm sub and a satriale sub with salami, ham, provolone, basil pesto, sweet peppers, and shredded lettuce.  I tried the satriale sub and it was excellent.  Filled with meat and cheese.  Then came a large tray of pizza.  Half of the tray had the Fremont pizza and the other half was divided between pepperoni pizza and classic cheese pizza.  The Fremont is an interesting pizza with banana peppers, house Italian sausage, cheddar, mozzarella, parmesan, and ricotta cheeses, topped with a white garlic sauce and toasted breadcrumbs.  Very tasty.  We finished with desserts of cannoli, Kahlua cake, and strawberry short cake cake.    It's good to have another option on Fremont Street for pizza and other Italian items."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice! One big slice and lots of flavor! I work downtown and have been to most pizza shops. Inside El Cortez is a hidden pizza gem. Slice of cheese is only $3. Anywhere else down Fremont is $5+. Highly recommended a slice from Naked City Pizza."}
{"text":"Thick crispy crunch dough with adequate cheese on a zesty tomato sauce that has notable Italian seasonings in it. No buttery, oily messy crust here. Came in at closing time and they were very accomodating.  There are desserts in a fridge carousel. Next time."}
{"text":"Good pizzas!!  The cheese and sauce ratio was fair with evenly spread toppings.  The sausage balls on the pepperoni and sausage pizzas are delicious.  Their large size pie can feed a small office.  I have only had take out and it is great everytime."}
{"text":"I like pizza by the slice but if you're going to get a couple of pizzas you might as well get a whole pizza. I went with the classic pepperoni pizza. Didn't disappoint! My pizza was cut in a rectangle, which is different.  I didn't get to taste it but my friends favourite was the Stromboli."}
{"text":"I do not know what the hype is all about with this place.  The slices are something in between a Sicilian and a grandma's style but really not either.  In the end it is just a lot of dough, not enough cheese and kinda bland.  If this place was in the NY/NJ area they would never make it.    Maybe its better if you get a fresh whole pie but my guess is that my slice was sitting around all day and then reheated because it was kinda dry if you know what I mean.  If you are drunk and hungry and need a break from the awesome single deck $5 blackjack a slice will do."}
{"text":"No no no no no...maybe the other locations are good but this one is so so bad. Took a long time to get our food (meatball and slice)...the people working there kept explaining they don't \"normally work at this location\"...brought out food out in to go boxes?!....the meatball was dry and did not come with the bread advertised on the menu. When we asked the waitress she said they don't give the bread at this location (we were wrong?) then we pointed out it said it on THEIR menu....then she came out with the bread. Don't be fooled by diners, drive-ins, and dives...you do not want to come here."}
{"text":"Tasty Tasty and never have to tentatively ask for condiments that should already be included in your order.   ain't nothing worse than buying $30 worth of dough and sauce but providing parmesan & pepper packets, ranch and more than three napkins is somehow too much.   You don't have to worry about that with Naked City.   First: Pizza on point. So no issue there.   Secondly: Delivery. They do it and they do it quickly.    Thirst. They have common sense. They dont need sanskrit etched into your Papyrus 4.0 comment box to know if u order pizza standard condiments and napkins are actually not so expected anymore in this industry so fucking thank you. Someone orders chicken? Fries? Oh look theres ketchup. Ranch. And bufallo. Oh my. This may seem like a small detail I've managed to drag out into, \"one of those posts\", but always my favorite pizza and delivery choice above all others because they dont want you calling back and hearing that snooty self entitled voodoo magication over the phone when they could have done it right the first time.   And they always do. So once again thank you."}
{"text":"We were just goofing around on Freemont st.  Decided to get a slice of pizza from somewhere.  I remembered how good, this place was on the other side of town.   So we ordered 2 slices.  OMG, this pizza was the best pizza I've ever had.  So after looking at the menu, we could have ordered a whole pizza for the price of 2 slices.  So if your going here to get a couple of slices, just order a whole one.  Apparently the girl at the register won't suggest that.  Just do it."}
{"text":"Stopped by and got three slices of the chefs special.  Shared one with a friend and we both agreed some of the best pizza ever.  Crust cheese just awesome.  Two nights later stopped and grabbed a sammie.  The satrali was awesome.  I've consumed many italian subs but this is by far the best.  Frequent this place. So we can keep it downtown."}
{"text":"Another location for Naked City, this one in the heart of downtown, walking distance from Fremont street.  The highlight for me was the Stromboli!  Excellent bites of subtly spicy goodness, just the right amount of cheese with a slightly sweet marinara dip.  I would also highly recommend the Fremont Street Pizza : House Italian Sausage, Banana Peppers, Cheddar, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Parmesan, White Garlic Sauce and Seasoned Bread Crumbs.  I LOVE white pizza, and the yellow peppers are a very welcomed addition...great choice here!  Can't go wrong with a Cannoli for dessert!  Well rounded lunch or dinner at a reasonable price :)"}
{"text":"With a car race in Phoenix, the 51's Season starting and four locations serving Las Vegas you might say Spring is starting out pretty busy for Christopher and Michael Palmeri, but don't think for one minute that has stopped the brothers behind Naked City Pizza from trying new things, Michael recently taking up baking and Chris planning the first in a series of dinners set to take place at The El Cortez on May 1st.  Now open four months and starting to gain a following inside Sin City's longest continuously operating Casino, a location just off the gaming floor on East Fremont still in need of better outside signage, it was just minutes to six that four adults and two kids sat down next to Arcade Games at a table set for a feast, Chris off in Arizona but Michael happy to show off some new ideas plus the skills he has been developing with Metro Pizza's John Arena.  Touching up the décor quite a bit since the beginning of 2018, walls now lined with black & white photos and the menu colorfully drawn in chalk, it was in the form of a gigantic Caesar Salad topped with housemade Dressing that things got started as \"Whoomp there it is\" played in the background, the first taste of Michael's Bread arriving not long after in the form of toasted slices dressed with nothing but good Tomatoes, Parmesan and Basil plus a brush of Garlic.  Not identical to other Naked City Pizza parlors in terms of offerings, each shop slinging unique items and specials to tempt fans on Social Media, course two presented eight Mushrooms scooped out and filled with a mixture of Breadcrumbs and Red Peppers in spicy Cream Sauce alongside one of Naked City's softball-sized Meatballs, the blend of Pork, Beef and Seasoning once again on par with what one might find on-Strip for twice the price and this time served with house-made Crostini.  Next taking a look at some El Cortez exclusives, the Satriale Sub first tasted in January getting a big upgrade with Michael's Bread that develops a crunchy crust and supple crumb through a three day ferment plus a kiss of steam in the oven, long-time fans will be happy to know that Pizza at this Naked City is available whole or by the slice, the Pepperoni always a favorite but \"Fremont Street\" unlike anything else offered nearby with three types of Cheese plus Sausage, Peppers and Breadcrumbs for added texture.    Rounding out the night with Dessert, a collaboration with Chef Douglas Taylor at Jerry's Nugget stocking Naked City's cold case with a rotating selection of Cakes and Pies, it was passing on Cheesecake that two wedges were served, the Oreo Cookie Cake featuring moist Chocolate layers divided by fluffy Mousse and Red Velvet Cake offering stiff Buttercream in place of the more traditional Cream Cheese Frosting.  ****1/2: The realization of yet another goal for Christopher and Michael Palmeri, Naked City Pizza inside a Las Vegas Casino, fans will be delighted to now find their favorite slice plus some new ideas in a whole new part of town while out-of-towners can now get a taste of the locally born product they've seen on TV without venturing outside the major tourist corridor."}
{"text":"We were staying at the El Cortez during the New Years Eve weekend and decided to have a piece of pizza at Pizza Lotto.  Low and behold Pizza Lotto was no longer there and Naked City Pizza Shop was in its place.  Talked to one of the cashiers there and ordered an extra crispy slice of cheese pizza.  My daughter, wife and I waited about 20 minutes before I got up from the table to check on the status of my order.  Cashier stated it will be out in 1 minute.  During this time we had seen numerous customers getting their order and we were there before them.  Waited another 10 minutes and just decided to leave without our order.  Very disappointed and decided my time was worth more than a $3.85 slice of cheese pizza.gg"}
