{"text":"Today, I decided to try out Peach Garden from my usual Vietnamese place in the same mall. The interior is cute as they have little booths in the front of the restaurant. 

I really liked their menu, it included pictures for every type of meal. Quite a variety, they had Thai and Chinese food options as well. 

I ordered one of their specials (it had a special banner on the picture in the menu), Vermicelli with spring roll, bean crud and grilled beef. You had the option to pick your meat. Chicken is my usual fair but I decided to venture out of the norm. Service too awhile for the food to come, I enjoyed my green tea while I waited. 

The spring roll was average, a bit greasy, no real crunch on the exterior. I liked the bean curd not sure what the flavour was. It was crispy. The beef was sparse, it was thin wafer of meat, nicely seasoned just wish there was more. The noodles and veggies were great, good balance of noodle to veggies ratio. 

I would come back and try out other items on their menu. It was good to scope of the competition in the same mall of my favourite place."}
{"text":"I purposely came here to take advantage of the Bun Rieu. There aren't many places in Toronto that can master this succulent meal and this place pretty much had it the closest. 

The restaurant is pretty much the same as any other viet restaurant and mix in the area where it's located makes it even more authentic. 

The restaurant is fairly clean and has enough space to hold a mass amount of people.

Their pho is pretty fresh and the broth is smooth. You don't get that thirsty feeling from the thousand ounces of MSG so that's good. It's not too salty, fatty and too little. The portion size is fair and the price shows it too. 

Definitely a must go but don't expect too much as it is definitely what you pay for."}
{"text":"For a hungry girl after an 8 hr road trip from the states, this place def hits the spot.  We came with our family of 7, and it's the first Viet restaurant that I've been to where you write down your own order!  It was pretty efficient.  I got the bun rieu, the portions here are gigantic! it was $7.50 and probably equivalent to 2 portions back in Eden Center in VA.  The bun rieu was very good, it had a lot of crab meat, blood, cha, and veggies-- although they served it with cabbage and not rao muong.  the husband got the com suong bi-- which for some reason is normal com, and the suong was pretty small but plenty of rice and other fixings.  My sister got the thai noodle soup.. she said it wasn't so great, it kinda taste like canh chua with noodles.  We also ordered a lemonade, coffee, and bubble tea.. all very good.  I would love to come back the next time i'm in Toronto... the soups at least hit the spot."}
{"text":"The service is very prompt and friendly.  I enjoy this location before the beef stew noodle is greater quality that other Peach Garden locations I tried.  I definitely recommend the beef stew noodle and is my ALL TIME favourite!"}
{"text":"Awesome Curried Pad Thai.

Just 4 stars because the service was kind of slow, and it's not quite a high end restaurant. Nevertheless, stop here if you need Thai eats and don't mind chilling for 25 minutes before you get your simple dish."}
{"text":"This has become a regular lunch spot for my family. Their salad rolls are made how they're supposed to be made with pork, shrimp and the right greens and noodles. Their ph ga is almost comparable to Ph Tien Thanh on Ossington. I enjoy most of their dishes. The bun Bo hue is quite good. They make their drinks promptly, which seems to be an issue with some of the other Viet places. They have a very large menu so there's lots to choose from."}
{"text":"Not too many Vietnamese restaurants I been to has such a good selections of Banh Cuon. I have this thing for Banh Cuon (Vietnamese Steamed Rice Roll). When I saw it on Com Tam Dao Vien's menu, I know right away I need to order that.

Banh Cuon Cha Lua ($5.50) which I intended to have as a snack was massive. I can finish that but I felt so stuffed after I washed down the whole plate with the iced cold jasmine tea.........

I left the restaurant full and happy without paying an arm and a leg..."}
{"text":"I like this place. I remember there used to just be the Asian grocery and Pho Dau Bo here.

Anyways, yes I think this place is good. Yes, I think you should come here to eat. My family likes to eat here. I think their banh hoi nem nuong with fried shrimp is very very good, sorry if my spelling is wrong, and good luck finding it in the menu! lalala~"}
