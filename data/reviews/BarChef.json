{"text":"Seriously the BEST handcrafted cocktails in Toronto!! Service is very friendly and they take the time to do things right! A must if you are visiting or live in GTA and never been."}
{"text":"For years, I had stuck to basic rum and cokes and simple drinks at bars because so many of the cocktails I'd get would be just...bleh.  The taste of the alcohol would be too strong or it would be too watered down or too sweet or too sour etc  I just popped in here the other day for a quick drink with a friend and had the basil dacquiri. Excellent!  Very smooth, easy to drink, nice flavour and the fresh lime juice was a fantastic touch.  Love the decor and the atmosphere. Sure it's not an every day pub and beer type place - but if you want that, you go to a pub."}
{"text":"A great addition to Queen W. Feels like a place you might \"find\" in NYC. They take their concept seriously. Drinks were exquisite. Had something sweet (but not too sweet) called Hazel's Lemons and then The Dirty barchef from the \"savoury\" list. Really, who needs food, but the carpaccio with guacamole/corn chips was excellent too."}
{"text":"I expected good drinks but not amazing food as well! Their Smoked Salmon and Mini Sliders just blew me away!...Will eventually go back for the $45 hickory smoked manhattan....."}
{"text":"Good selection of cocktails and drinks. Service is good. Come with a group."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Best handcrafted unique cocktails we've ever had. The molecular cocktails are a cool must try. I would take half a star off because the service can be a little slow, but I won't because it is understandable since each cocktail is handcrafted by trained mixologists. We always make sure to stop by whenever we are in Toronto...and hopefully we'll be dropping by this weekend. Best bar in the city!"}
{"text":"What a great night! We (group of 6) arrived at Barchef on  Saturday evening at around 8pm. We waited about 15mins and then were taken to a long table in the back that we shared with another group of three. We ordered a lot of different drinks. Everything from the molecular stuff to the sipping cocktails and punch bowls tasted and looked amazing. What really won me over was the service. The staff were incredible and very helpful with suggestions and recommendations. Cannot wait to come back and try more. My personal favs were the \"Spring Thaw\", the \"24 Karat\" and the \"Jimmy Cliff\" punch bowl."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks with my husband on a Saturday evening. They said the line will be 30 minutes and we were hesitant but it moved so fast we were waiting for 10 min tops.  The environment is cozy, bartenders are great, nice to see males serving instead of your stereotypical hooch.   The drinks: we tried the ones from their modernist section which is what they create and are known for. Yes at $30-35 a pop they are pricey but they are an experience in themselves and very tasty.   Had an overall great time and will go back there."}
{"text":"Barchef (Frankie) creates edible liquid art.  This gem is unassuming from the street but once you step inside the incredibly chic lounge you are in for the culinary beverage experience of your life.  On a Friday or Saturday get there early to snag a seat at the bar where you can watch Frankie work his magic; your senses will be dazzled with fireworks, aromas, and taste sensations.  Hazel's Lemons is the perfect balance of sweet & tart, not too much of either, just lovely and refreshing.   I put myself in Frankie's hands for a Freestyle and wasn't disappointed with my trio of savory concoctions....can't remember what was in them but it was a surprising and delectable journey, including the edible flowers.  The Caramelised Banana is like banana's foster in a glass, so good I had two.  Everything is made from scratch from the best & freshest ingredients and although these are some of the highest prices for drinks in the city it is worth every penny!    The decor is warm modern glamour; perfect whether you're out for a romantic evening or a night on the town with friends.  If you're out to impress this is the place to go.  Also a great spot for a ladies night because Frankie's drinks aren't the only things that will make you swoon; this stylish man with his killer smile and luscious drinks is trouble!!  Barchef would rival any NYC establishment."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place and slightly disappointed that I have been missing out all this time. I was a little concerned about the price, but it's actually not as bad you'd expect. The drinks are strong and $13 for a double is not unreasonable, especially when the drinks are this amazing.   I would recommend sitting at the bar because you can get recommendations from the bartender and watch them make the more interesting drinks. Even if you can't bring yourself to buy one of the molecular cocktails, you can still watch them play with frozen carbon dioxide (apparently it carbonates the drink!) and create vanilla wood chip smoke.  The drinks on the Sipping menu taste stronger and have a lot more nuance than the ones on the Sweet and Sour menu. We tried drinks from both and liked the Sipping menu better, but I think that's just a matter of preference.  The only drink that I wasn't a huge fan of was the Spring Air, it just tasted like grapefruit and it had way too much egg white foam on top. It wasn't bad, I just have higher expectations at a bar like this.  I'm still thinking about the Mezcal-esque, which was probably the best margarita I've had. The fresh lime really makes that drink, and the slightly smoky flavor from the smoked salt rim and hickory syrup adds something different and unexpected. I will definitely go back and have another one of these."}
{"text":"If you fancy a glass of old lady's perfume come here.  Horribly overwhelming drinks. I was drinking a bouquet of lavender, or maybe a vase of roses with a hint of shoe polish, or nail varnish remover with a dash of turps. This experience has put me off any sort of floral drinks for life! We got sucked into to the gimmicky dry ice, and took a huge walk to get here from down town, got soaked in the rain - it was not worth it at all.  We ordered four drinks from the modernist menu, three were awful. One was ok, the sailors mojito I think it was, but definitely not worth the hiked up price for a bit of dry ice. Night blossom was the worst, yes like eating a flower soaked in cold windex. I am not a deer. I had to fight my body's primal urges to vomit just to give it a chance.  Never again, not sure what the fuss is about. I won't be returning. Tight seating facing each other, not a date night drinking venue where you want to sit next to your mate. Strange location, nothing else to do nearby.  Almost gave it two stars because the waitress could see we did not like the drink and offered to get us another free of charge (she was clearly familiar with the look of disgust). We did not take them up on this as it was certain the next drink would be just as bad, we left. It's unfortunate because the effort to try something new and creative was there visually, but when it came down to flavor it was awful, a real let down."}
{"text":"Pretty good place, and the ambiance was good.  I went here on a date, so the background is pretty important IMHO.  The service was great, and the food was good, I just don't know if the price quite lined up with the quality.  Which is not to say that the food was bad, because it wasn't, it just wasn't as good as what I would have expected to get for the amount of money I paid.  So, I guess my rating is .... ehhhhhh."}
{"text":"I've been to many bars in Toronto, none of which have provided me the same quality of service as BarChef has done. I went on a Friday with a couple of my friends. It was our first time going to BarChef so finding it was a little tricky as the outer decor is dark and the venue size quite narrow. Be that as it may, we found it. Luckily we were able to be seated at a both in the back section. Soon after we were greeted by a very pleasant server who quickly took our order.   One thing that caught my eye as soon as I sat down was the water container already placed on the table. I've noticed from the other bars I've been to that nobody places water on the table, and when they do it's later in the night (if at all). Safe drinking is important, and I appreciate the small details BarChef does in order to make sure that is covered.   My one friend was having trouble picking a drink on the menu, thankfully the server was patient and provided her many options that she might enjoy. Patience is something that is lacking in many bars, not here.   I think the highlight of my night, among the great company, atmosphere, and ample service, was the drink I ordered. Among all the cocktails I've had thus far, nothing gets better than a SAINT 75 for me. Sadly close to 0 bars in Toronto know how to make this drink (I suggest you all try it someday). So I figured asking for this drink might be a lost cause, but I decided to ask anyway. Originally the server had no idea what this drink was, nor did most of the bartenders, which didn't surprise me. Soon after I was dealt the bad news, the server approached my table with a drink- to my surprise it was the Saint 75. She told me Mr. BarChef himself made it for me. It felt amazing knowing the establishment went out of there way to make me the most obscure drink so that I would be satisfied- even the smallest things make the experience that much more special.   To conclude, I must say, visiting BarChef was an experience. One that I plan on reliving again, very soon."}
{"text":"We went there especially for the \"Modernist\" experience and it was fantastic.  Each cocktail is made with innovative creation, using dry ice, flavored ice and special glasses.  Ever drink a cocktail using a bowl and spoon?  They can show you how.  Modernist cocktail is around $25 per drink, pricier than other regular cocktails."}
{"text":"sat at the bar with a friend. wouldn't think of sitting anywhere else. got to watch all the activity behind the bar - quite the operation!!   had an amazing line up of drinks (btwn the both of us):  1. Freshly Rasp'd 2. Ginger Lemon Mash 3. Sailor's Mojito (highly highly highly highly recommend)  4. Basil Daiquiri 5. Mezcal-esque 6. BarChef Rocket ....would recommend each one. all perfectly blended and presented.   the drinks we had were $11-13 which is very reasonable for what you're getting - booze mixed with all natural, in-house made ingredients in an awesome atmosphere. there is a page with $25-75 drinks - if you don't want to spend that, don't! for those people who deem this place expensive, think about the whole experience. it's well worth the money.   bar-chefs are knowledgeable, friendly, passionate and add to the experience.  hickory smoked wood chips on fire (literally), dry ice, minimal yet perfect decor. bunsen burners, things boiling over... felt like a really cool, tasty chem class.   ever been to little branch/east side company/weather up in new york? this place might even be a little better (i didn't think that was possible!!!). mixology, emulsification... mojito ravioli?? brilliant concept.   finally a bar in toronto that marches to the beat of it's own drum. how refreshing. far exceeded my expectations. will be back... many times."}
{"text":"OK, so I'm a huge cocktail lover. I met a person at the airport bar who was lamenting the lack of depth in their bloody mary (just like me!), and got to talking. Thankfully, they were a Toronto native, and tipped me off to this place to get my mind bent by some crazy cocktails.  I'm not going to lie - this place was a fabulous recommendation. My fav cocktail place in Toronto. There are a lot of things to really love about this place - cool, chill, yet unpretentious atmosphere. Incredibly nice bartenders (go on an off night - they are a blast to talk to, and really know their stuff. Thanks Aaron!). Incredibly inventive cocktails, at a price to match (unfortunately), but really are worth it. Keep your palate clean - don't pregame, and get your tastebuds ready for an out of body experience!  The thing about the more inventive cocktails is that the liquor taste does not smack you in the face. To me, this is sort of a double edged sword - it makes them a lot more accessible to non-career alcoholics, but some miss a certain subtlety that a stiff whiskey drink can have...particularly in the finish (I'm referencing this to a lot of drinks I've had at Bourbon & Branch in SF: http://www.yelp.com/biz/bourbon-and-branch-san-francisco or The Alembic in SF: http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-alembic-san-francisco). Also, I should say that I didn't try anything off the \"classics\" list when I was there, but I will do so next time for sure.   Will I go back? Absolutely...probably later this week :). And yes, you will notice there is a $45 \"manhattan\" on the menu. Is it worth it? At least once. My curiosity would have killed me if I didn't do it - the description and ingredient list was a little too irresistible for me to not get. It is very smooth (thank you crown royal XR), very dark (thank you hickory smoking), and very complicated (thank you vanilla bean & house made bitters). I loved it."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place on a Wednesday night, after too many drinks elsewhere, and it was just what we needed to end the night.  The vibe was incredible--the birch-tree wallpaper and the smoke from the recommended Fire and Ice cocktails made it feel like we were at a campsite in the middle of nowhere, very intimate and warm.  The drinks, too, were amazing: molecular gastronomy in a glass!  Each cocktail felt like a work of art, with flavours that you don't normally find in liquid form (I ordered a seasonal gin-based cocktail that was spiked with dill and coriander).  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Barchef is almost everything I expected it to be. Nondescript from the outside, dark on the inside, beautiful servers, molecular drinks. The only thing that threw me was the music. I expected some kind of trance or house music, but instead was treated to upbeat 60's hits. Love it!  This is the place to be and be seen in town. The drinks are creative and have a depth of flavor that you don't get at a \"bar.\" Beautiful people all around and top notch service.  I had the Scottish Breeze (x2) and the GF tried the Basil Daiquiri and the Rocket. We were both pleased. My guests were slightly less adventurous, opting for scotch and red wine.   While the music is great, it was a little loud. Be prepared to talk loudly to converse.  This place is a gem. Don't let the prices scare you. Truly an experience."}
{"text":"Ever since I heard that Barchef is the kind of place that'll serve raw oysters with a Bloody Caesar*, I've been intrigued. So when Kat F. made it a stop on the Yelp Cocktail Crawl, I was all over it like Kanye West on someone else's special moment.  The interior is dark, all black and purple, giving it a creepy Michael Flatley love-den vibe.   It was a Thursday night and the place was packed with slicksters in suits and chicks who stay skinny by barfing up their drinks in the john after midnight. They all milled around the bar, held together by the invisible layer of slime they were collectively generating. We opted to lounge on the banquette near the entrance.  I sized up the extensive drinks menu and ordered the Cocktail du Jour ($15)--a surprise concoction the bartender whips up that day. Cool. I like surprises and I let this be a test for Barchef; it was their one shot to wow me.   The waitress brought my CdJ: a raspberry vodka drink with sherry and vanilla syrup and about three inches of foamed egg-white head served in a large wine goblet. It was definitely a well-crafted drink, I'll admit, but I generally don't like sweet cocktails and I was a little offended that they thought I was the kind of gal who likes raspberry vodka. What do I look like? A former cheerleader from Jersey who gives hand-jobs in the bathroom?**  I loved the drink Kat F. ordered (Van Gogh's Downfall, $12 http://www.yelp.ca/biz/barchef-toronto#hrid:ayXS-cKEoD8kJVyBON97EQ) and I like the idea of a bar that approaches its drinks with an obsessiveness I normally only see in Japanese bars. It's pricy for sure but I'd rather pay $12 for a well-made cocktail than $8 for the well liquor-flat tonic water-desiccated lime wedge in a glass you get at every other booze joint. I'll be back to try another drink on their ever-changing menu--at a time before the smarmy brigade descends upon it.  ________________________ *For non-Canadians, Bloody Caesar = Bloody Mary with Clamato. Sounds ew but actually delicious. **Um...I'm not saying I know anyone who fits this description, I'm just saying..."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best bars in Toronto. Very creative and yummy cocktails. Great place for a date or a casual hang out for a small group of friends. The staff, especially the bartenders, are very professional and welcoming. I definitely will be going back during my next trip to Toronto!"}
{"text":"I am giving this a place 4 out of 5 stars because the drinks were very impressive! I had an amazing Black Truffle cocktail. It was the perfect start to my friend's stagette!"}
{"text":"BarChef is a trendy, chic bar that channels the spirit of artisanal drink bars in the Ginza district of Japan.  Coming here is equal parts for the experience as it is for the menu.  The restaurant is dimly lit and moderately noisy, creating a warm intimate atmosphere.  The drinks themselves are nothing short of pieces of art.  While most of the drinks on the menu are well-crafted, the selling attraction of BarChef is in the Modernist menu.  You'll want to try at least one of these out.  Be warned, you're looking at $25-45 a drink.    Every modernist drink has its own unique identity.  The Essence of Fall is nothing short of a centerpiece, a forest garden with smoky vapour and fresh pine and rosemary scents wafting, all to couch the syrupy brandy concoction hidden within.  The Smoked Manhattan, the priciest drink, comes served in a cake dome covering smoking hickory embers that infuse the Crown Royal and Brandy mixture with real smoke flavour.  The other creations, while less attention-grabbing, bear the same style of presentation and uniqueness.    Where they really drop the ball is in their service presentation.  The wait staff, while perfectly courteous, seemingly don't care much for the artistic aspect and read off their descriptions like bored news journalists.  Given how trendy and avant garde they've presented the rest of the atmosphere, to say the lacklustre effort was jarring is an understatement.  They'd do well to hire more artiste-savvy staff.    Unfortunately, the high prices and the lack of artistic values means that for most BarChef may be a one-time visit.  A shame, because it really offers something unique to the downtown scene in Toronto."}
{"text":"Oh, you want to order a traditional gin martini with extra olives?  Well too bad!  If you go here, you have to order drinks with a minimum of five ingredients and sit there in an overly dark room with clothing clearly not suited for the likes of this place because you didn't know this was going to be the after-work drink spot.    That said, hey, do you like to try different types of cocktails that are not your traditional gin martini?  Well, you've come to the right place.  With an extensive cocktail menu filled with lots of adjectives: these fancy-little drinks will definitely have your palette wondering what the heck you've just put in your mouth.  The flavours are playful and though some of the drinks are a miss and not a hit, you can at least say you tried it.   The price range is about $10-$12 but they do have the $20 section towards the back of the menu if you're feeling even more fancy than the usual $10-$12 fancy.  I tried the Louvre, some cucumber-infused thing, and the seven-forty or some such number.  I must say though that after this place, I was craving my usual drink(s)."}
{"text":"Got the Mad Men and the Black Truffle with a friend. Awesome service, unique drink/edible combos. The Black Truffle was amazing! And the leather/liquid nitrogen with the Mad Men was pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Drinks and ambience are awesome! It's a cool New York style speakeasy in Toronto. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Dark, long and narrow place; weird colored lighting. A bit dated if you ask me.  Liquor selection is quite limited, little high end stuff.  Close to zero wine/beer selection.    Sweet cocktails, varying in taste from cough syrup to Cool-Aid. I could not find a single cocktail on their menu that did NOT contain any syrup or 'bitters'. And that's what you are pretty much stuck with. Classic cocktails, not so good, lack of liquor selection. They make all the syrupy stuff themselves, apparently, and the bar looks a bit like Harry Potter's lab.   A poor (and 25 years younger) Carrie Bradshaw would probably like it here.   Excellent fries.   No Plymouth gin, which, in my book, automatically disqualifies ANY place from consideration as a watering hole.  And no, its not the LCBO, they have it.   One of the bartenders kept wearing a weird hat inside, trying to channel Justin Timberlake???  Ahh, before I forget they are trying to offer 'molecular' cocktails. Now, I've been to Alinea, that's REAL molecular stuff, but at Barchef, all you get is a little smoke from dry ice, and some gimmicks."}
{"text":"Amazing bar.  Drinks are pricey but I always order the most expensive one. Smoked Vanilla Manhattan.  It is the best cocktail I have had, hands down.  Frankie the owner is very polite."}
{"text":"I love this place. Really dark atmosphere, it's lit by many many candles. I loved the jazz music- they played lots of Billie holiday. We ordered the sailor's Mohito and Spring Essence which were both 25$ each and made in the actual kitchen. Presentation was beautiful. Both drinks were well thought out of and pieces of art. The bartender Matteo was interesting and...dreamy."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails. They take bar tending to a new level. Drinks that both taste amazing but appeal to all your senses as they look and smell great and make having a drink a real culinary experience."}
{"text":"Barche was an incredible experience! We didn't have reservations and came at peak time yet got a table in 5 minutes. The price is high for the lavish drinks but it's worth it, and snacks are cheap to pair with it. The waiters were so nice and checked in us frequently. It took a while for our waiter to come around with the machine to pay so another waiter offered us this pallet cleansing dessert like treat to end the experience. It was delicious and very unexpected! Such wonderful staff and food/drinks. I would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to BarChef months after they first opened, over 6 years ago. It is still the best (by far) cocktail bar in the city. Even from outside the place is oozing with cool, mystery and style. The dark, sexy, candlelit room makes everyone look and feel amazing. The service is always on point, knowledgeable staff who are happy to recommend their favourites and talented no BS bartenders who magically whip up anything on the extensive cocktail list OR are happy to show you their artistry with a free style. The small bites are perfect for the venue, all you would want to soak up the booze in your stomach. Whether going on a date, out with the girls/guys or for a special celebration, BarChef truly is the best option in the city. My favourites are the Four Seven Two and Symphony No. Five and from the modernists menu, the Daiquiri Adaptation. You really can't go wrong with anything.  Feel lucky to have such a world class establishment in our awesome city!"}
{"text":"Great expectations fall flat for my husband and I. They are trying to be like Aviary in Chicago (with the use of molecular gastronomy and mixology) but miss the mark. They are all about the show but do not deliver with the flavor. I had the Spring Thaw, one of their signature drinks and the gin just overpowered everything else. It was not well balanced at all. For a signature drink that's $25 I think I'm right to say I have expectations. I was sorely disappointed. There were 10 of us in total and none would return. We tried drink after drink, their punch bowls as well and it was all just meh."}
{"text":"We visited Barchef right when they opened, so it was nice and empty.  I enjoyed the atmosphere, pretty cool and loungy.  We sat right at the bar and was able to chat up the bartender as well as shake the hand of the owner.  We told them we were from Chicago, and they told us how Grant Achatz has visited.  The drinks were phenomenal.  They are very innovative, involved to create, gimmicky, but it works. After trying the Lavender, Olive and Cherry and Black Truffle cocktails, the name \"Barchef\" makes a lot of sense.  They aren't just serving drinks.  They are creating a dish for you.  They also make a mean mocktail and only charge $5.50 for them.  First place ever to make me an egg white mocktail."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday and it was pretty quiet.  The waitress recommended we try the Modernist cocktails which they are known for. We ordered the essence of winter and the sailors mojito. The drinks themselves were well crafted and well balanced. I liked the all of the edible component,  but for up to 45 dollars a drink it was not worth it for me. All of the dry ice and drinks served in a forest was complete overkill, but I guess some people enjoy the spectacle and experience. The thing that made me really dislike this place was that the waitress brought my drink when my one other guest was in the washroom. By the time he had returned, she had taken away all of what I paid 30 dollars for (the dry ice and the serving tray etc). I think it is general service decorum to wait until the entire party is there to bring out the food and drink (especially when its only two people and the place is not full at all). I was really excited to try this place on my recent visit but if you have limited time, I'd probably skip this."}
{"text":"Awesome bar! Came to celebrate a friend's birthday. Service was good, cocktails are molecular gastronomically crazy and we we were even treated to special shots courtesy of the boss man Brent! Highly recommended to check out for that special night or a weekend on the town!"}
{"text":"This place is like walking into a mad scientist's lair for finding the next drinkable elixir. It is really cool, you can see at the bar all the different jars of fresh juices and mix and they're sometimes boiling or smoking of some sort. Great place to bring a date and try a few different drinks but be prepared for the hefty price tags. Most of the stuff that's worth trying will be  greater $20, I even saw their famous Vanilla Hickory Smoked Manhattan being made as I walked in but at $45/pop I opted for Sailor's Mojito at half the cost. Great drink, very creative, and definately a conversation starter with your date but becareful cause they will get jealous.   All the drinks here are fantastic and they use nothing but the freshest ingredients. If you are a hard liqour fan they have some stuff you can't find at the LCBO. The service was fantastic as well, everyone is very informative with no attitude. They place does get packed up later on at night so arrive a bit early if you want a seat."}
{"text":"We got here early and things started out well enough. She got the Rocket and I tried the Sailor's Mojito, both were excellent. We then decided to try one more, the winter cider which is very fun as you mix it together, but the taste is somewhat unusual, definitely not for us. The drinks have nothing to do with the rating, they were great fun and for the most part delicious.   The rating is based purely upon the service we received. We arrived somewhat early around 730 and as the night progressed and it got busier the level of service we had diminished to the point where we had to wave someone down to get the bill. We waited 20 minutes after we were done with our last drink and our original server had all but moved on from our table it seemed. Had we wanted to order more drinks or snacks we wouldn't have been able to, and frankly after waiting that long we wouldn't want to anyway.   It definitely seems like we had a bad experience but I can safely say we won't be back to drop $20 a drink for terrible service."}
{"text":"It was fine. A man was eating next to us, I cannot,even a gun to my head tell you anything he was eating but he loved every bite!  We just had some drinks.  It is much more a place to be seen than to really have a love-made drink."}
{"text":"A cosy, dark, and beautiful bar to go with your date. It's tiny but they serve tons of drinks. I stopped by for a drink on NYE, it was not a suitable place for such an occasion but great for regular days."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of innovative cocktail bars .. Bar Chef has the fun wow factor that surprises you unlike anything else in the city. But the taste of the cocktail is always somewhat of a disappointment.  Great place to take a date for the wow factor but there are loads of other places to go to for a decent cocktail.   Also, ask the servers if you want a cocktail that comes complete with the pizzazz of smoke and garden .. there are only a handful on the very long menu list."}
{"text":"not a full out speak easy so don't expect booths for just you and your friends.  the waitress was attentive.   i didn't try any of their \"experiential drinks.\" mostly drank from the sipping menu page, which is generally fine. toasted islay smelled and tasted pretty good and if i ever came back, it would back for that."}
{"text":"Trendy dimly lit place with smoke - probably better as a date place or a night out with girls. Drinks are expensive so it's better to soak up the atmosphere and onto the next place.  Favourites are the essence of fall or sailor's mojito. Haven't tried anything off of the modernist drinks menu to rate it."}
{"text":"One of the best bars in the city, period. Definitely on the pricier side, but so worth it in terms of the ambiance, vibe, creativity in the assortment of cocktail choices and overall general experience."}
{"text":"Sailor's mojitos are the best! Hickory smoked Manhattan is pricy but good!  Overall atmosphere is very relaxing! BarChef is a great place for drinks for two.  It is very intimate and DARK, barely could see the menu. But once you know what to order it actually don't bother you anymore.  Love this place! Was there a couple of times and definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"BarChef is a modern and unique experience with a retro, almost Victorian or Steampunk flair.   It's impossible when you enter to miss the fact that this place is special.   The staff is incredibly friendly and interested in explaining their craft. From their in-house infused bitters, to cocktails bottled and aged.   You may find your cocktail experience includes edible components or aromatic enhancement.  It's molecular gastronomy meets mixology.   This is a must visit locale in Toronto and is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"I don't know about BarChef. I have now been there three times, and frankly I don't get what the fuss is all about. It is CROWDED and poorly designed in terms of layout, so you are always smashing into people if you do not have a table. If you are lucky enough to score one of the few tables near the front, be prepared to be blasted with cold air every time the door opens.    The cheapest drink on the menu is $13, they don't pack a punch in terms of alcohol content and every one I have tried (including ones with Bourbon) were too sweet and too watered down. Note that many of them are served in those teeny 60's punch glasses, meaning you will down all $13 in about 2 sips. These $60 bills for 3 drinks and no buzz...   I appreciate the craft and all, but the overall experience does not warrant the expense. Its far too expensive and the music is... really not for me."}
{"text":"The drink menu is very good (tried the Scottish Breeze and the Four Seven Two)  and both the fish tacos and the pulled pork sliders are delicious.  I like the decor and ambiance but if you require reading glasses to see menus regularly, you may find it very difficult to read the menu due to the soft lighting in this place.  Would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"My go-to drink place in Toronto. Was in town for 4 nights and spent two nights at Bar Chef. I've been sipping cocktails on 5 continents and the modernist drinks at Bar Chef are not only drinks but an experience. At first, you may shy away from the page due to the price but you're doing your senses a disservice. You get what you pay for. It's visually artistic and enticing to the palate. Didn't care much for the saffron sunset though on the sipping page but I would just recommend being braver than me and just jump in. Had the Apricot, Black Truffle and the Violette. Black Truffle remains my favorite - had it both nights. Thank you, Matteo (spelling?!) and Bar Chef. Well done!"}
{"text":"This bar is absolutely amazing.   From an ambience perspective, it has a cool, dark, speakeasy-esque vibe to it. From the moment you walk in, you'll notice its slightly obscure but modern entrance, and the rest of the bar kept dark. The bartenders always look dapper, and the service is always on point.   For a first time visitor, I'd recommend the Sailor's Mojito. Yes, it is probably the most expensive drink, but it tastes amazing and the presentation is impeccable. I'd also recommend the Scottish Breeze. Each of the modernist cocktails are are product of molecular mixology - a must try. All of their cocktails are innovative, and each ingredient a seamless addition to their concoctions. If you're going on a weekend, I'd suggest giving yourself ample time, as it can get busy. Otherwise, well worth the visit, and a great place to sip a drink with friends."}
{"text":"There is nothing else quite like Barchef in Toronto. If your tired of the same watering holes that only provides beer, mixed drinks and a sub par atmosphere, than Barchef is for you. It's a bar that has style without the attitude. The decor is sleek, simple and cool. The music is upbeat and trendy without distracting you from an intimate conversation. The cocktails come in an amazing variety of flavors that will fill all the senses. The bartenders Frankie and Aaron should have their PHD is cocktail mixology. Throw any base alcohol (vodka, gin, absinthe etc.) and a secondary taste (sour, sweet etc) at them to challenge them to a freestyle experience - where they will create a wonderful concoction tailored to your tastes. If you want to feel like your in NYC (PDT, B East, Death & Co), LA (The Varnish), or Chicago (Not Telling) for the evening - you've got to swing over to Barchef. Make sure you get a seat at the bar for a view of all the action.  Frank and Aaron are the real deal in the mixology biz..Cheers!"}
{"text":"truly the most creative bar i've been to. first, the atmosphere is very cool - long narrow room, dark, dimly lit, big bar area, chill lounge style. the drinks are just crazy (in a good way) - real oysters in ceasar, lime foam on top of mojito \"ravioli\" shots (a shot that's enclosed in a thin skin to hold the shape and then pops when it's in your mouth - sort of looks like an egg yolk, but awesomely amazing) - and that's merely a couple examples of what barchef has to offer in their creative mixology drinks. yum yum yum. it has a great list of sweet and savory cocktails that's unlike anything you've ever drank!   my friend knows the bar folks there so we got to try things that weren't on the menu. it can get pricey so not an ideal place for you to spend the entire night - but definitely a great starting point! i'm SO going back when i'm in toronto~"}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5 stars Pros: Incredible drinks and good ambiance. Cons: May need to wait in line, very pricey, and service is Toronto-level, i.e., needs some improvement.  Drinks are incredible if you order well. If your friends have been before, follow their recommendations. I followed the recommendation of the server for my first drink, an updated Manhattan (Antique Formula), and I was nearly punched out with its strength and sweetness. (I speak as someone who enjoys whiskey and bourbon straight). The Antique Formula is a drink you have to work up to and sip very, very slowly unless you want to flashback to being force-fed cough medicine by your mum. However, I really enjoyed my second drink (which I now forget, but was on the weekday menu), a refreshing, citrusy cocktail which went down easy.  The ambiance is fantastic for cozier couples or small groups of friends. We were squeezed into a small \"booth\" as a largish group and it was not pleasant. We were promised that we could move to a larger spot if one became available, but that never materialized. The music was good but loud, so you kind of had to shout at the server. Server disappears easily and the service does need improvement, especially at the prices of the cocktails.  Would go again, but only for one or two drinks and only after payday."}
{"text":"This is a must visit place. Great bar if you want to take someone for a special evening. Their signature cocktails are worth the price as they are truly and experience. All other cocktails are done to perfection."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance and the drinks here! I think this spot is rated one of the top bars in the world and for good reason.   I normally wouldn't spend 25-45$ for a cocktail but their menu piqued my interest. I tried the sailor's mojito which was very well made. The cocktail itself was great and the presentation was even better. They use a combination of sea sand and dry ice to give you the illusion that you're by sea. How cool!   This is a spot I would bring any one visiting Toronto to! A true Toronto gem!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous place for after dinner drinks and definitely a date night option. Drinks are pricey and definitely yummy. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable. The My drink of choice was Strawberries and Lavender. We also enjoyed a quick snack of spicy nuts. Yum! Will definitely be back to explore more of the menu. The presentation of some drinks is pure entertainment. One lady had a floral arrangement that also involved dry ice. Spectacular!"}
{"text":"So molecular. Dry ice. Attentive service. Everything made in house. Sure, it'll cost you $15 a cocktail, but it's a great spot to start or end your night. I had a manhattan, and the bitters had a lovely touch of clover in them. Just lovingly touched by clover essence. Lovely!  Don't ask for a Labatt 50."}
{"text":"Pricey but worth it, I got one of their speciality cocktails called the Sailor's Mojito. They come in fancy trays and they explain exactly what is in front of you. I did not like my drink and felt it was too sweet but I am sure the other drinks are amazing. My friend loved their drink and for the price it is definitely worth it. The place is a nice set up and dimly lit with candles for a romantic feel."}
{"text":"My go-to-bar when I want to impress anyone... The molecular drinks are very unique and tasteful. Intimate and chill vibe."}
{"text":"I was here last night and wasn't sure what to expect, but boy was I blown away. I went ahead and figured I'd try something off of their modernist menu. The cocktails were amazing. The creations were just spectacular. Well worth the price. Really made for a fun evening to try a few of their unique cocktails. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"BarChef is pretty hidden with its black doors and drawn black drapes - I could very easily have walked right past it without noticing this cocktail bar.  I was recommended to order one of their Modernist mixed drinks, so I tried the Sailor's Mojito ($25) - beach essence, sailor jerry rum, mint, fresh lime, vanilla syrup, mojito ravioli, fresh lime and vanilla air. It made quite the grand entrance, smokey and smelled amazing! The mojito ravioli is completely new to me, so when the burst of flavor was totally unexpected!   I tried my friend's Hierloom Caesar ($25) - infusion of thyme, shallot, garlic, fennel, tomato water vessel, clamato snow, celery snow, pickled beet brunoise, parsley - and it was SO DELICIOUS. It's almost like drinking a hearty soup with subtle hints of tomato. I was in awe of the presentation, how the top of the bowl melts into the bottom also with the smokey effect.   My only complaint is that they don't accept reservations, so our group of 10 had to wait over 30 minutes to get a table and eventually had to be divided up into two tables. It was also extremely loud inside, I had to yell into my friend's ear just for her to hear me, and I was sitting right next to her.   Overall, service was excellent. The staff did a great job explaining each drink, and how to drink them. They were also very accommodating with separate bill requests. If you're normally not a drinker, let me warn you the drinks here are STRONG. Barchef's specialty cocktails may be pricey but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Molecular cocktails = (TAs)Ty  (Bu)t  EXpEnS1ve  Remember when you were new to drinking and you wanted to get your buzz on...  Taking all the booze in your cabinet, you threw everything together in a shaker, added ice... voila! It's a drink.  Now charge $45 for your concoction and serve it at a bar on Queen street.   Okay, I actually did like the drinks here! Some of the drinks were odd but pleasant, however, the sweet and sour confusing my taste buds probably isn't my thing.   We came here for drinks on a Thursday night around 11pm.  There was lots of space to sit and stand.  The decor is modern and offbeat.  I really liked the black and white plush chairs.... oddly matched with the into-the-wild tree wallpaper.  It's perfect if you wanted to have a fancy cocktail night... in the middle of the woods.  Floral Fizz. ($20 Molecular) * Frozen carbon dioxide (Buh? ...Gee, I couldn't taste it) * Riesling  * Yellow chartreuse * Cardamom syrup * Apricot bitters * Lavender sugar rim * Topped with coconut foam  The drink was okay but didn't look \"molecular\".   It was super sour.  I was hoping for more sweetness and floral accents from the Lavender sugar...The flavour was a bit harsh.   The best part was the foam... the things that I would eat that off of... Anyways, yeah.  Peat  ($13 Sipping) * Islay Scotch *Cinnamon infused vermouth * absinthe rinse * lemon twist  This drink was one of the better ones of the evening.  It was refreshing and well, you can't really go wrong with absinthe and Macallan single malt (which happens to be my scotch of choice).  The drinks here are damn expensive... but if you are looking for something different, you'll find it here."}
{"text":"Sweet tooth? Get a Rocket. Like fresh and neat? Get a Basil Daiquiri. Big party? Get a punch. Any, really. Adventures type? Get a modernist cocktail or better talk to bartender!  *lovelovelove. Been here before will come again. And again."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. Drinks aren't cheap but a fun experience for the pallet."}
{"text":"This is a good late night last drink place! They have fancy cocktails with liquid nitrogen and a good selection of absinthe! If you want to impress, that's the place to go! Location is great too and we always get a good service.  Be careful if you go there with lots of people. All the drinks are such masterpieces that you will want to order them for yourself too!"}
{"text":"Great place for a fancy (and expensive) cocktail night. The place itself is tiny so you may struggle to get a seat but once inside the ambience is super cool and the service is fantastic. The servers are all well versed in the background and particularities of each of the cocktails and the cocktails themselves are extraordinary. Each one is not just a great drink but a show as well.  Try the absinthe if you don't know what to order, the actual preparation of the drink at your table is half the fun!"}
{"text":"I like the cozy atmosphere. It's a nice spot to bring a date. The drinks are very gimmicky but that's what justifies the prices. You'll leave with a memory for sure. I wouldn't go there to drink with the boys but for date, double date or triple date, I absolutely would."}
{"text":"Came with me and my coworkers on Saturday night. Super packed but we didn't wait too long before getting seated.  Server was so friendly and kept checking on us. Food and drinks arrived not as long as we thought considering how packed it was. I loved their drink menu and you should definitely go for their apps."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night and sat at the bar.  Overall drink quality is good.  Atmosphere is good.   Drinks however are way overpriced and service was so so. If this was 5 years ago I'd say the signature drinks were innovative but now I can get them at major cities in the world for a lot cheaper and have them prepared in front of me instead of in the back.    The bartenders knowledge was limited (did not know what's in the bitters) and I had to ask three times to get an answer.  I did not really like my drink and he didn't go out of his way to make sure i was happy.  I would have expected him to ask if I wanted another drink when I accidentally spilled mine.  So overall an average experience that cost way way too much."}
{"text":"This is by far the coolest bar I have ever been to in my life.  I dont get how anyone says it is not one of the best bars. I can see if you just like rum and cokes or bud lights that this wont be your bar of choice... But other than that this is the spot.  Menu is split into different type of drinks, forget the exact break down but something along the lines of easy sippers, heavy booze, and then like crazy modern drinks.  You have to try some of their crazy drinks and their shot raviolis."}
{"text":"Wow, not sure how to describe this other than to say look at the photos. This takes craft cocktails to a whole new level with a multi sensory experience with the drink, taste accompaniment and visual.    We got the Cedar, Day Turns into Evening, and Manhattan and all were off the charts.   We bought the recipe book signed by the chef to try and duplicate this in some small measure at home."}
{"text":"If you're someone who truly enjoys cocktails and gastronomy then I would put Barchef on your to-try list.  Barchef isn't a lounge or a bar in my opinion. It's an experience.  Don't go for regular cocktails get something unique off the menu or even have a bartender make you something off-the-cuff.  The cocktails are so unique and fun to enjoy.  Yes they are pricey but you sip them a lot longer than you would a regular cocktail and you'd probably only order one or two for the evening.  The Smokey Manhattan is probably the show stopper of the menu. It's a beautifully crafted Manhattan carried in a smoking vessel to be infused with all the wonderful tones and flavours of the smoke.   The space itself can be more loungy in my opinion.  If you're not sitting at the bar your basically missing most of the action."}
{"text":"Service: 4.5/5 (We accidentally broke the glass while playing around with one of the fancy cocktails; they replaced the whole thing, no questions asked)   Drinks: 4.5/5 (Fun and interesting for their amped up cocktails)   Value: 4/5   Repeat: Maybe (my favorite is still Spirit House)"}
{"text":"Molecular gastronomy is making it big in NYC and was even featured on Top Chef. Drinks using gels and foams and \"airs\" are all found at Bar Chef. This place is crazy! Drink prices start high for some of the cooler items on the menu. I am told they have wine and beer, too.  The atmosphere is also a reason to visit. Stop by on a weeknight for after-work drinks or a weekend to blow your drinking budget on one fine drink. Not for those who would rather be across the street at Tattoo Rock Parlor... this is folks who want to appreciate the drink, not drink to get drunk."}
{"text":"Huzzaahh!! Finally a cocktail bar within driving distance that knows how to make drinks the way they are supposed to be made - and in ways I never though possible. Yumm-O!  I was shocked and surprised that I had missed all the buzz about this place until some friends (non-Yelpers believe it or not) said it was basically \"where all the cool kids were going\". No kidding - Barchef is awesome.  The candle lit tables surrounding the main attraction (the bar) are abuzz with people straining to read their menus but the music is kinda retro-geeky cool. Some funky old tunes mishmash with modern day hits. Adding to the general trendy ambiance (of so old/weird its cool) is the fact that they have reels of old silent films being projected on a wall just to the left of the DJ booth - SAweeet!  However, enough about the look and feel, how does a Barchef cocktail taste? Unbelievable! I went with a couple friends for a quick stop and here is what we ordered:  Friend 1 - (asks for a Coors Light...smh), server talks him into order a Red Stripe (you go girl)  Friend 2 - slightly more adventurous asks for Jack and Diet Coke  Me - after a fill read of the menu like it was the Saturday Star, I turned it over to our server and simply said - \"give me the house favorite\". Here is what I ended up with...  The Four Seven Two (which I believe takes its name from the bars address - won't be forgetting that anytime soon now that's for sure) :Bourbon, Cola Bitters, Fresh Lime, Muddled Mint (lots of it) and Mint Syrup. At $13 I still felt like I was getting the better end of the deal - that Sh&* was goooooddd!  But what about my friends, how did they react? Friend 1 was floored by his Jamaican brew and Friend 2 simply said \"Holy Crap Kris - this is strong\". Thank you friends, welcome to a TRUE TORONTO COCKTAIL BAR.  Other items of note that will be on my TODO list next time I am here will be one of their steaming molecular drinks and the shared punch bowl.  Will gladly go here anytime with anyone - Let me know I just need an excuse!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend spoils me in every aspect apparently, he now spoils me with cocktails too. He took me there to have their Hickory Smoked Manhattan. AMAZING! He didn't let me look at the drink menu because the damn drink cost him $45 but, well worth it. I'm sure we will be back to test out other cocktails when we visit Toronto. My boyfriend ordered himself the Old Fashion, which was delicious. I am typically am not a fan, but we ended up switching drinks at the end because I took a liking to his drink. So spoiled, I tell ya...  This lounge is a must. If you want to check out a place that is trendy, with a great atmosphere  and even better cocktails. This is it."}
{"text":"Love the vibe in this place!! Smokey and dark, just like many of their drinks.  Do not miss the Truffle - you get the most incredible edibles that go along with it.  Also, a must: the Manhattan - it comes out with a huge lid filled with smoke that is infusing the drink. The cup needs to be wiped down after to remove the soot! High quality, delicious drinks!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love BarChef but a few things fell short.  We arrived around 10:30-11 pm on a Friday night. It was packed but we were told that the wait for two people was around 15-20 minutes. The hostess told us that we could go have a drink at Rush Lane and she would call when a table was available. We had a round of drinks at Rush Lane. After 30 minutes or so and no call, we decided to walk back over to BarChef. The hostess was sitting another party of two (which I would told that I was the only party of two on the list when I initially put my name down). The hostess acknowledge us and stated that we would be seated shortly. Twenty minutes after being seated, we received a call saying our table was ready! Really???  The drinks were good. I loved the presentation of the Mad Men. This cocktail was good when it finally arrived from the kitchen! It took about 45 minutes to get this drink after we ordered it! We kept being assured that it was coming. It was very frustrating to say the least. Great drink, but not if you have to wait this long.  Four Seven Two was very good and made at the bar, so no issues here. It was my favorite, but I also liked that I didn't have any problems getting the drink in a timely manner.  Skip the food items here. We tried the truffle potato chips and sliders, which neither one was good.   The atmosphere is really nice and upscale. It's sad that the service from start to finish diminished our experience."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of Whiskey along with some of the most creative cocktails! Chatted with their manager by the end of the night. Great service and a designated date location. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Really amazing concoctions! I tried the Pear and Rosemary and Toasted Islay, which were both tasty with distinctive flavours.The staff were very accommodating, efficient and polite. We were a party of 9 celebrating a friend's birthday and they took such good care of us, plating and serving our cake and even found us candles to put on the cake since we'd forgotten about them altogether! Very much recommended!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal cocktails with special effects in a candlelight room. Every cocktail is far more than a drink. Ans so it's their price. Will be back"}
{"text":"Amazing creative barchefs.  An adventure for the senses.  You don't drink these cocktails, you experience them with your eyes, ears, nose and mouth.  We tried four of the molecular masterpieces and then indulged in a number of fantastic original concoctions.  My only disappointment, they couldn't leave me with secret recipes.  But honestly if they had I doubt if I could of reproduced if I tried.  One of best drinking experiences of my life!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited BarChef on a recent trip to Toronto and it certainly lived up to the hype and our expectations.  There's a very lively cocktail scene in Chicago where we're from (Aviary, Violet Hour, etc.) but BarChef was refreshing for a few reasons, not least being price and the lack of a wait.  We were anticipating a long line to get in so we went early, but to our surprise we walked right in with no wait.  We had two cocktails each and found the total bill to be very reasonable, even without the \"discount\" due to the exchange rate.  I'm not sure if there's anything else like BarChef in Toronto, but if you're into trying new things and willing to spend $25-40 on a cocktail, it is certainly worth a shot.    We had the Cedar, truffle/coconut drink, and a few others and all were enjoyable.  Overall, BarChef has a great ambience, great staff, and wonderful cocktails.  We'll definitely visit next time we're in town."}
{"text":"We ended here on a mundane Tuesday and as we walked in with nondescript front. The door setup is kinda odd as one has to turn abruptly as there is very little space between the two doors. I was looking forward to showing this spot my friends from out of town as people recommend this as the go to spot for Amazing cocktails. When we walked in the place empty and I mean empty as we were the only people in the bar. We thought why do they bother even opening on Tuesdays then the Symphony performance ended and people started to pour in and the place got busy. I am proud of the mojitos I make and had heard so much about this spot that I had try these. Friends also followed suit.  In the meantime I kept them showing pics of the amazing cocktails they do on the phone.  Finally our drinks arrived and immediately drew the ooh and aah from us.  Well here we have it folks I had to actually ask the server on how to drink this cocktail (a first one for me:) The smell was coco-nutty and as explained it is supposed to remind one of the beach. They achieved what they set out to achieve here, lotsa cold smoke which emanates aroma of all sorts.  I tried the mini deconstructed version of the mojito first and one is hit with citrus punch initially followed by a soothing hit of rum. Very impressed. Then we went for the main version of the mojito served in a glass. The foam on top was very citrusy and the main packed a wallop. It was mainly rum I think as there wasn't hint of club soda if you ask me. Not a traditional taste of mojito for sure but an excellent drink nonetheless. Then someone at bar ordered the Manhattan (my friends thought the place was burning as they couldn't see the bar) and boy that drink is a visual feast. Vanilla, hickory smells and smoke. We wished one of us had ordered that drink. Ah well next time. I like the setup as it is relaxed and one can have a conversation here.  Service is good without being overbearing.  High recommendation here folks as I have found my favorite bar in TO.  4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Somewhat overpriced for the quality of pour, but an enjoyable experience nonetheless. They need to improve their edible accompaniments to their beverages, I wasn't sold for the $25 I was spending per. Go with what's in season, you'll know what I mean when you browse the menu."}
{"text":"Man, if you wanna spend a fortune on a crazily inventive cocktail this is the place to go.  Frankie was charming, his cocktail was ridiculously good, I walked out a different man.  A great place to impress a date."}
{"text":"Absolutely recommend!!!! Been there done it!!! A must try:  'CEDAR' and 'SAILOR'S MOJITO' with extra 'MOJITO RAVIOLI'!!!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I am not a cocktail person. I drink them too fast, or they are too sweet, or too boozy. But something about the concept at Barchef really appealed to me, so I wanted to check out it. Plus I figured I could just drink wine if things really went awry.  But: I didn't need to! As the name implies, they really know what they are doing when it comes to booze. I tried the Chamomile Julep and the Four Two Seven and they were both really balanced and enjoyable. The ingredients are fresh and from what I understand mostly made in-house.   I was there on a Thursday night and while there were lots of people there, we were able to grab seats and enjoy our drinks. I also liked the dark, old-timey-ish setup on the bar with jugs and ladles and brown bottles of liquid concoctions."}
{"text":"I'm normally a die-hard beer drinker but enjoy the odd cocktail every now and then. Bar chef is my go-to cocktail bar in Toronto (and reminds me of Le Lab in Montreal). Barchef was ranked #7 in the world for innovative bars.    I really like the atmosphere, the lights are dimmed with multiple cozy seating options. I enjoy grabbing a spot on one of the comfy black couches.      The service is always excellent. Anyone new to the bar asks a multitude of questions about the drinks and the staff are always eager to respond. Servers are also great at making recommendations, just tell them what you like.  Drinks prices range from $8 for specials all the way up to $45 for the Vanilla Hickory Smoked Manhattan.  If you feel like experimenting, try one of the Molecular drinks. These drinks are incredibly unique, complex and deliver one hell of a visual experience. Get your cameras ready.  I ordered the signature Vanilla Hickory Smoked Manhattan ($45). The drink is served in a giant glass dome with smoking wood chips that infuse the drink with amazing smoked flavour. The waiter uncovers the drink which unleashes all the smoke - what an experience. On the down side, I smelt like the smokey wood chips all night.  Other standouts include the Coconut Mojito ($13), the Basil Daiquiri ($13) and the Rocket ($13). I liked everything I tried here.  I never tried the food but the sharing dishes really look good, especially the sliders and charcuterie plate.      Highly recommended not only for the drinks but for the spectacular presentations. It's fun to watch the \"mixologists\" make their signature creations and to see the looks on customers faces when their smoking drinks arrive.     BK"}
{"text":"This place is great!   Gets really busy on a weekend night especially but worth the wait. We luckily didn't have to wait too long. Got the bar seats for two. Probably the best seats since you get to watch how the drinks are made.   We ordered the Essenes of the fall and their signature martini. Both out of this world amazing, flavour wise and presentation, really worth every penny.   The drinks smoke out of the cups, the scent is amazing (essence of the fall, really feels like you're drinking a cocktail in a forest).   The servers are really welcoming and upon bringing you the cocktail explain the drink and what's in it."}
{"text":"This place has many reviews, so I don't have much to add.   Love the atmosphere and the cocktails. I think it's a great place to take visitors.   That being said, I have to mention that I think the \"modernist\" drinks are gimmicky and overpriced. The dry ice really doesn't serve much purpose, other than to provide some good pictures and video. These drinks are something that I'd expect at a touristy joint in Vegas.   I'd recommend sticking to the normal cocktails... they are tasty, and worth the $15 or so that they cost."}
{"text":"What a new tasteful and adventurous experience. The modernist drinks really challenge your palate and the different textures of the entire drink plate are so innovative and carefully thought out. I've never tasted before what I tasted on my plate (the Black Truffle) and it was amazing. The staff are so knowledgable and really compassionate about their drinks. Definitely recommending this gem to all my friends visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"This is not the kind of place you go to get wasted on a Saturday night. They hand carve the round ice, for god's sake. This place is pricey and I'm not that big a fan of the communal seating, but it's a place everyone should go to once. I don't know if the manhattan is worth the money, despite the effort that goes into making it, but if you want a $45 instagram post, get it."}
{"text":"Completely in love with this place and we are not surprised It was voted the top 100 best bars in the world by food and wine magazine. This was a complete experience, including molecular shots. I strongly recommend BarChef to anyone who visits Toronto, Canada. The mixologist use molecular gastronomy techniques to create unique experiences. They used a process called reverse spherification technique, which consists of submerging a liquid with calcium content in a bath of sodium alginate. The sodium alginate is mostly used to create these spheres with liquid inside that burst in the mouth, it is incredible. They are also served with \"aromatic essences\". The Sailor's Mojito (from left to right-drink, essence, shot) includes Sailor Jerry Rum, mint, fresh lime, vanilla syrup,a mojito ravioli-alginate shot and vanilla air, coconut oil and beach essence. The Aviation Shots were alginates served with a red grapefruit essence, also both feature a component called an air which is made with soy lecithin."}
{"text":"Unbelievable experience! The atmosphere reminds me of a sexy, smoky speakeasy. Sure some of the cocktails on the menu have a steep price tag but it was well worth it.   I indulged in the Lavendar, Olive and Cherry while a friend of mine had the Sailor's Mojito. Both of these were classified as a 'molecular' cocktail and were $25 each. Total perfection!  The bartender serving us was one of the owners (I think). Very friendly and entertaining.   I can't wait to go back. Do yourself a favour and go. :)"}
{"text":"I came to Barchef last night and my drink, or shall I say, my drink paired with an exotic dessert was fantastic. My friend and I ordered off of the Modernist menu and I would definitely recommend you do the same. The modernist menu is a bit more pricy but the drinks have two parts. They have a dessert and a liquor.   I ordered the Daiquiri Adaptation and it was fantastic! My beverage arrived in a coconut shell and my dessert was made of coconut water snow and dry ice. It had lots of flavour and toppings.   The waitress informed me on how to enjoy this exotic drink and snow combination. She told me to first take a small spoonful of the coconut water snow, which tastes like a lime mojito sorbet, and then place it in my mouth and follow with a sip of the beverage. Together this was the best **dessert** I have had since discovering I am both lactose and gluten intolerant. I would definitely go back to try this at the end of the night to satisfy my sweet tooth.   My friend ordered the Vanilla and Hickory Smoked Manhattan. He said it was his favourite drink on the menu (he comes here a lot with clients). It smelled like roasted marshmallows. Unfortunately I couldn't try it because one of the ingredients could have gluten in it.   I would definitely go back to Barchef. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the waitress brought out my drink and we had to wait another 30-45 minutes for my friends drink to arrive. It would have been nice if they came out together."}
{"text":"I went to Toronto for a conference a couple weeks ago, and my husband Matt B. flew in for the weekend, as neither of us had been before. We only had one night in town, which happened to fall on the 8th anniversary of the day we started dating--no longer an important anniversary, but a great excuse to go big in what was technically a foreign country. We made the most of it, having an extraordinarily decadent date night. We had a reservation at Alo, but we decided to kick things off with a visit to BarChef.  This was an impromptu visit. We found the place on Yelp a little over an hour before our dinner reservation, and decided we wanted to squeeze in some over-the-top cocktails as long as we were going big. We had a very short window to get this done--our reservation was for 9:45, and we arrived at BarChef at 9:15. The restaurant was just a short walk away, and we figured we had a few minutes' leeway, but we were definitely rushing. Luckily, we were able to get seated almost right away, and proceeded to enjoy a sinfully extravagant speed round of drinks.  The space was fun and lively, with a fancy lounge atmosphere. It was busy when we arrived, on a Saturday night, but not so busy that there wasn't room for us to sit down. I think it was more crowded when we left, but it looks like you can walk in here on a weekend and expect to drink without too much hassle. We got a nice high table for two, and a server saw to us right away. We explained that we were short on time and asked for the check to arrive with our drinks. She got it, and accommodated us without apparent judgment.  BarChef has an extensive cocktail menu, with most of the drinks hovering around $15 (that's Canadian dollars, which would actually make this place reasonable for what it is in Los Angeles, where this tier of cocktail bar charges the same in US dollars). But we didn't come here to drink sazeracs--we came for the dramatic modernist cocktails. We'd only ever seen drinks like these at Aviary in Chicago--literally the Alinea of bars--and were excited to see what this place had to offer.  After some deliberation, we ordered the Vanilla and Hickory Smoked Manhattan and the Essence of Fall. The bar took somewhere around ten or fifteen minutes to whip up our drinks, leaving us about twenty minutes to consume them. This window contracted when our server got our order wrong, bringing us the Pastels of Violette instead of the Essence of Fall (we'd been debating between the two of them). We thought about just going with it, but we wanted the ridiculous forest cocktail. She took the Pastels of Violette back (what a waste! I hate when bars send out the wrong drink and then don't just let you have the free drink) and put in the right order. We drank our Manhattan and watched the clock tick down on our second drink, which took a while to assemble (I don't think they put a rush on it, but I also know that our time crunch was stupidly unusual).  Both cocktails were marvelous. The Vanilla and Hickory Smoked Manhattan came in an enormous bell jar clouded opaque with smoke. Made with Crown Royal Special Reserve, vanilla-infused brandy, cherry and vanilla bitters, hickory smoked syrup, and smoked hickory and vanilla, it infused before our eyes. Our server removed the cloche when it was time, and we enjoyed a wonderfully smooth, rich Manhattan dense with smoky burnt hickory flavor. At $45 Canadian, this was the most expensive cocktail I've ever had. Kind of extreme, even as a vacation indulgence, but it was delicious with great presentation, and I have no regrets. The Essence of Fall ($30) was even more elaborate, described on the menu as \"a transporting and immersive journey, as if you are entering an Ontario forest on an early autumn morning.\" It involved brandy, maple, Fernet Branca spherified granita, balsam fir, rosemary, sweet vermouth, orange blossom, fresh mint, cedar, moss and soil. It looked like a centerpiece, the cocktail nestled in a tangle of wood and greens. The final piece of the presentation was a pour of dry ice smoke tinged with aromatics--pretty sure this is where that moss and soil came in. The drink itself was fantastic, fragrant and balanced. It was also a \"transformative cocktail,\" meaning the flavor profile changed as the Fernet granita melted. Of course, we only had about ten minutes to let the cocktail transform, so we were bearing down on that cube of granita with a spoon, encouraging it to break up and melt quick. I left with the last big hunk of it in my mouth, freezing my cheek.  I wish we'd had a few hours to spend at BarChef. It was a special place, with great ambiance and destination cocktails. I'm glad we got to check it out, and would definitely go again if I found myself back in Toronto."}
{"text":"What can I say- I absolutely love Frankie and the BarChef team, they've done a few events for me (yes, they will be a part of cool events).  When you walk past the storefront, the place looks closed- if it's on operating hours, I can assure you, it isn't. The bar drowns out the outside light with blackout drapes to give the inside a dark, alluring, smokey vibe. Open the door and you'll see plenty of happy people inside.  We spent far too much money in this place trying as many cocktails as we could- from Mad Man, which they give an antique leather-infused scent to so it legit smells like an arm chair, to the daiquiri adaptation (coconut drink comes in sand- don't try eating the sand) with some awesome edible snow consisting of toasted coconut and maraschino gel. These drinks were on the higher end of the price point scale, so we also tried the Rocket (mimics the red, white and blue popsicles you ate as a kid) and the backwoods boulevardier.  The cocktails are a bit expensive, but it's really because of the time and energy (and infusions) in creating them. Think about it as going and buying a plate of food prepared by a chef- the more expensive drinks come to you served just as such, beautifully presented and meant to play with all your senses. Here, they truly are Chefs... of liquor!"}
{"text":"Hidden away on Queen west behind an unassuming black door, BarChef has an establishment which feels very classy and up-scale.  The cocktails are expensive, but you would be hard pressed to find more interesting presentation or taste.   We arrived late on a Tuesday and settled into one of the very comfy sofas. Our waitress was over quickly and attentive of our needs for the duration. We ordered a mix of drinks including 2 of their signature 'Modernist' cocktails. These came out with an impressive flair and they tasted great.   BarChef would definitely be a great date spot.  Highly recommended for it's uniqueness, but you have to pay for it."}
{"text":"Yes a unique drink experience! The drink was insane(essence of fall) Great presentation great taste that changed as the ingredients melted. Just a very fun and unique drink.  Pricey but with it. Wish i would have gone sooner so i could have had more than one drink. Very dimly lit but a real nice place to have a good conversation etc.  Definitely get the specialty drinks as most people order them for a reason.  If I'm back on this side will come again for sure"}
{"text":"If you're in Toronto, this is a must-try.  My friend and I dropped by around 7pm on a Friday night.  We went rather early as we knew this place would get crowded.  We asked to sit at the bar because it's always more exciting to sit at the bar.  The inside was pretty dark and loud.  The bartenders were super nice.  When they arn't busy, you can often see them chiseling ice to create spherical ice balls.  I ended up ordering the Four Seven Two ($15), which is named after the location of BarChef.  My friend opted to order from the Modernist menu, a Spring Mojito($25), to get the BarChef experience.  It definitely did not disappoint as the price was quite steep.  Both drinks were well crafted."}
{"text":"Our server was extremely rude, her name was Ashley, other servers were unhelpful and on their phone despite the customers asking for assistance. The drink was also awful, I ordered Daiquiri Adaptation and all I could taste was the melting paper straw, even though the drink has only been sitting there for 5 minutes or less."}
{"text":"The best time to come to Barchef is undoubtedly during the week. I came here on a Tuesday night and it was not crowded at all. Alas, I was able to have a comfortable non-crowded cocktail-sipping experience without \"the scene.\"   I would have sat by the bar, but we decided to get be a bit more comfortable. It is very dark in here and all the bottles and 'potions' at the bar add to the overall feel. The waitress was really friendly and knowledgeable, she knew all the ingredients for each drink by heart.   I decided to go with a sweet and sour cocktail--the almond and the orange cocoa cocktail. They were both GREAT drinks, the almond not as strong but the rim was surrounded with crunchy bits which made for a beautiful presentation. My orange cocoa cocktail literally tasted like orange and cocoa and was a bit stronger which I liked. I saw someone having the echinacea molecular cocktail but perhaps I'll save that for another time. At $45/drink, I have big expectations for those.  We also tried some of their small plates. I would suggest the sliders-- they were so juicy and delicious. The frites with the truffle mayo aioli were very bland and burnt. The beef tartar was tiny and nothing to rave about .   To sum up, I would definitely come back only for the drinks."}
{"text":"My experiences have been mixed (hurray for cheesy puns) but keep in mind that the few times I went here was back in 2010. I remember that some of the drinks and ingredients described on the menu ended up sounding and tasting way better in my imagination than they did in reality. I think the price factor plays a psychological role though. Some of the herbal notes are very intense and so be careful when choosing what you order. A waitress brought my group free samples one time which was pleasant.   As the name of this Queen West spot suggests, the man making your drink is a bar \"chef\", i.e., a mixologist. His name is Franki Solarik and he's earned a reputation by winning mixology competitions and igniting the bar chef trend in Canada. This man is seriously passionate about your cocktails.   All of the drinks are skillfully concocted from an array of spices, herbs, homemade bitters and other unidentified potions sitting stylishly on the bar top. Franki will even personalize drinks based on specific taste preferences but newbies typically start by choosing from the four-page drink list, which includes a section entirely dedicated to molecular drinks. A 45-dollar Vanilla Hickory Smoked Manhattan stands out to intrigue some and to shock others. A snack menu is also available until 2 am."}
{"text":"It was good and fun when they opened up, however with time their drinks started tasting like medicine cabinet. Staff is inattentive: both waiters and mixologists. Very loud, hard to talk. This review is based on my past 3 times on different days of the week."}
{"text":"Truly one of a kind! This bar has the friendliest staff and bartenders and the most interesting modernized cocktails! I had one drink that smells, looks and tastes like the 'essence of fall' and another that was like the ocean. These cocktails are a bit pricey but they do have other traditional cocktails to choose from. If you're visiting Toronto or have lived their your whole life, definitely go check this place out!"}
{"text":"Dark, loud music, a trendy place. $45 for the signature \"hickory smoked Manhattan\", unusual, a one time experience. Sailor's mojito, thick and sweet. Shrimp tacos, excellent, except one couldn't see them!"}
{"text":"Was recommended to try Barchef while visiting Toronto. Went on a weeknight so bar was somewhat empty however service was phenomenal and the waitress was very friendly. Tried \"The Rocket\". Was delicious. The place is a little too dark inside for my liking but definitely worth a stop for a great cocktail."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place. The entire experience, from watching the bartender chop off ice from the giant block on the bar, to a smoked Manhattan that is served under a smoking glass dome, is amazing. I tried one of the 'molecular' drinks...black truffle...and words can't even describe the flavour! I would have ordered more and stayed longer, but these drinks are pricey...not a place to go if you want to order from the wine list. This is a bar for serious cocktail enthusiasts! An experience for sure."}
{"text":"very cool but pricey place. Its a good stop for one or 2 drinks, to pick up the vibe and then move on. I had THE famous Manhattan there.  Quite a show! with fire and the steam! I loved it! The drink itself was delicious, couldn't even taste the whiskey in it. And it was pretty strong. But it was the whole experience that counted. The waitress was a super excited person about the bar. loved that. She knew everything about all the menu items and gave us a pretty good description of them. I went there on a Wednesday night and the place wasn't busy at all."}
{"text":"By no way is this place cheap, but it is by far the nicest and coolest place for drinks if you're willing to shell out some serious cash. It is decorated much like a speakeasy, the music fits that image and it's quite enough to actually do some serious catching up with your friends or your dates. Just sitting there will make you feel fancy-shmancy.   They have regular cocktails, but you shouldn't go there for those. Instead, get something from their special drinks menu that focuses on having 3 components: drink, eat and smell. Behind each cocktail is a story and they are all served to you like a piece of art. Seriously, I could look at their drinks all day.   If you have a large group, they also have punch bowls. The price tag might look steep, but they really are strong and a bang for your buck (at this place) if you have enough people to share it.   The only reason I'm only giving this place 4/5 is because of the price."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Awesome cocktails, music, and vibe. Drinks are deep in flavor and complex, definitely thought and care has been put into each drink. I'm not too good with the super strong trasting drinks so I had the Daiquiri Adaptation (excellent) and the Coconut Mojito (excellent). My friend had the Black Truffle (which I liked a lot bit our server told us that because of the truffles, some people like the different taste it had to offer while others didn't, but I absolutely loved it!). Another friend had their signature drink, the Vanilla and Hickory Smoked Manhattan... What beautiful presentation!! A definite must try! The drink was too strong for me but my friend that ordered it is a seasoned and appreciative drinker and loved it."}
{"text":"Anna was the best. I've been to places all over TO but she just rocks it. Everything was perfect.  The drinks we're awesome. The bartenders were amazing. Loved it all - but Anna needs a raise."}
{"text":"This place is one of the most interesting cocktail lounges I've ever been to because they implement molecular gastronomy into their cocktails!   The drinks are a little on the expensive side (can be around $30 for the really creative ones) but they are worth it for the creativity alone that goes into them.  I ordered the sailor's mojito, which was a really good mojito served with a small \"amuse bouche\" of limey-tasting foam and a small bubble filled with minty mojito-y goodness.   The decor of the place is interesting too - looks like a swanky science lab inside with bottles on the walls."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is cool! Even for someone who's not much into alcoholic drinks, I was impressed by this place and what it has to offer.  Actually didn't yelp this place before coming in. Had just seen people come in and out before as I passed by, and yesterday I happened to be with someone who had wanted to come here for a long time. So in we went!  Neat atmosphere, dark with mist/smoke and candles. I got the toasted fizz which turned out to have a black licorice taste to it (which I don't like, but some others might!). The toasted fizz just came in a regular champagne glass.  But then! My friend's Night Blossom came, and that was something else. The presentation alone was quite jaw-dropping. It was a bowl of noodles with snow and jelly on the bottom, and then the liquid was poured on top. It's served with chopsticks and a spoon so that you eat it like ramen.  We sat at the bar and our barchef Mateo was super friendly. If you want the full experience here, order something from the Modernist menu."}
{"text":"The staff was incredible and very helpful. It was a great experience - not a place I'd go to on the regular, but rather on special occasions. The drinks were flavourful and were presented very professionally."}
{"text":"Cozy place for socializing with friends or dates. They have normal cocktails from $14-16 or more fancy, extravagant cocktails for $30-$40. The extravagant cocktails come with the allure of an experience either in the form of smells, visuals or tastes such as smoke or earthy materials that depict Ontario and it's nature. Definitely puts a dent to my wallet, but it's a nice experience once in a while."}
{"text":"I went with a group of around 7, we did make a reservation and had a high table to the left of the bar (right in front of the DJ) ready for us. The server was friendly and when it came to choosing the drinks she was very helpful in making me decide once I told her what kind of thing I was looking for.   The big advantage here was that since I was in a group of around 7 and each of us got 2 - 3 rounds of different drinks, I got to sample a lot of the drinks on the menu. And they were very hit or miss. Some of the drink were just not great tasting, and I don't mean in a way that gin and tonic is not super tasty(I do enjoy gin and tonic fyi), they just didn't seem to sit well with some of us.  Some of them were indeed excellent, I would like to say all 3 of my drinks were amongst our favourites, but then again I did have the servers backing when ordering them.  I wish I could remember exactly what I ordered, I know one was a certain award winner and the other was one off the $25 menu.(Mojito as pictured above).  My first pick was a peach bellini of sorts, now I may not have the greatest knowledge on drinks, but in my head a bellini means an ice drink (thank you Milestones) but over here, it was just a normal drink that had some champagne in it. Slightly disappointed by that but it was OK.  I don't think some of the drinks are worth the amount they go for, the environment here is not the greatest for socializing as they just play the music too loud to hear anything(maybe being right next to the DJ did not help?). This place gets 3 stars because most of us left disappointed in the outcome of some of the drinks, but at the same time, the ones that hit it off with our drinks did leave very satisfied! I was expecting more though, while our server was friendly, I still didn't get a \"friendly\" vibe out of the whole place.  Definitely worth a visit if you want to try something like this out. I would suggest talking things over with your server if you need help with anything."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim Saturday night as we were in the area looking for a place to sit, chat and drink after dinner and I remembered a friend had talked about this place.  The drinks were a wide range of prices but definitely leans on the side of pricier especially given its location isn't in a 5-star hotel or the financial district.  However, the drinks we had were both tasty and strong which makes their $13 a pop price tag reasonable especially compared with other bars that boast innovative cocktails.  Too many of these and you won't know what hit ya.  We sat at the bar which gave us a great \"front row seat\" to viewing the bartenders/mixologists at their craft and there were lots of people ordering drinks with lots of smoke (dry ice?).  It must have been popular as we noticed the smell (smells like a shisha bar) as soon as we walked in and our clothes smelled like it when we got home.  There were also lots of couch-like seating for slightly larger groups.  We were 3.  This wouldn't be an ideal place for a large group of people - too busy and wouldn't be able to all sit together.  This place is ideal for checking out different cocktails (their specialty) and they have a very limited selection of beer in bottles in case you have someone in your group not up for cocktails.  So this may not be a place that everyone will like.  Everyone from the bouncer, to the hostess, to the bartenders were friendly and courteous.  We had the Strawberry and Soda and the Coconut Mojito and both were delicious.  I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I'm not usually one that likes to pay $$$ for drinks or small plates of food, but when it comes to something unique that you cannot find elsewhere, its totally worth it.   Barchef was the first stop on my last night of singledom with the girls. They don't take reservations but we got there around 8:30pm on a Saturday night and nabbed one of the high bar tables for the 10 of us.   Since we were a big group we got the punch bowls. The Fifth Ave was our first choice, Raseberry Vodka, Blackcurrant Liqueur, Vanilla and other fruity stuffs. It was smooth and was amazing. $90 for a large bowl.   We got a 2nd bowl to try, but it was very different, infused with chartreuse (which we googled - it's a liqueur and where the colour got it's namesake). But wasn't a huge fan of the lavender and spicy tasting.   All that, came out to about $20 a person, which wasn't too bad. One day I\"d like to come back and try the wood burning cocktail that we smelt. Other drinks seemed to be expensive but decently priced. Just be prepared to drop at least $20 for drinks.   Could it be really gimicky? Possibly, but the reviews don't lie."}
{"text":"Loved BarChef! The ambiance, customer service, and cocktails were top-notch. This bar is a hidden gem with some of the craziest presentations for cocktails! I ordered the Spring Thaw and it came in an extravagant flower arrangement and topped with dried ice! Super cool, and the cocktail tasted amazing as well. It's a bit on the pricey end for the modern cocktails, but worth it for the experience!"}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite bars in the world. The service is wonderful and the cocktail experience itself is phenomenal. During a 3-day Toronto trip, my fiancée and I came here twice.   The space is very romantic and great for a date or intimate drinks with friends. They have one of the best coconut mojitos we've ever had. I couldn't resist the Vanilla Hickory Smoked Manhattan and it was so worth it. The giant smoking bell jar really makes for some drama.   I think about this bar all the time and recommend it to all of my friends passing through Toronto. Everyone loves it!"}
{"text":"Amazing drinking experience. When I visit Toronto again, my evenings will end here. It elevated cocktails and how they should be experienced. It is worth every $$$."}
{"text":"awesome! Recommend springfield cocktail. It is amazing."}
{"text":"Want to enjoy a cocktail or two in what I will describe as the best place for first date drinks then 'jobs a good 'un'.   The mood of the bar is relaxed and staff are friendly. The bar is dark...reading the drinks menu is like reading in Dickensian times (by candle light). My eyesight is not great so I almost fall over bar stools trying to make my way to the washroom.  The drinks selection is superb and varies in price with some of the cocktails costing $45 ...these will impress!   There is a distinct smokey smell in the bar but it is pleasant and warming.  I really do like this bar!   It is unassuming and not pretentious. Great spot!"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in here for a drink last night and I thought it was a pretty cool, little spot. The bartenders are extremely knowledgeable--or maybe it's all for show. The drinks and beautiful and unique but the price tag is quite high and the pours are small. The drinks are strong enough that you don't need a big portion, but if you're the type of person who drinks quickly, you'll probably want to be careful here to not get too drunk or too expensive."}
{"text":"Just went to Barchef with a group of friends for my bday. Loved the experience! All of the drinks were delicious! The atmosphere was amazing and the service was top notch! Our waiter was super fun and brought us shots on the house for everyone at the table for my bday. We tried all 4 of their punch bowls, which were all superior in taste to most other Toronto lounge bars.  I had one major issue, I hadn't eaten much at all and I came home feeling like I could drive my car (I would never attempt that after drinking 10+ drinks), but this leads me to think that they are lacking in alcohol content. I also had 2 shots..that were definitely alcohol. Would love to know if others thought the same... Although, I would return and try some of the other cocktails mostly for the atmosphere and the deliciousness of their concoctions.   Thoughts...?"}
{"text":"Their motto is \"A modern approach to cocktails\". This must mean their approach is commercialism--any place that measures their whiskey pours strictly by a shot glass is not about \"mixology\" or the experience of drinking.  On a positive note, their cocktails were tasty."}
{"text":"Walking into Barchef, i knew i had found a good place and wouldn't wanna leave. You're immediately hit with the greatest smell in the world. This smokey sort of maple smell is very strong but definitely in a good way. The inside is very nice and one if the nicer cocktail bars i've been to. The real reason i wanted to come here was the drink menu. The prices are a bit steep ranging from $16-$50 for cocktails but if you're gonna have a $50 cocktail, this is the place to go. They know what they're doing here. You can tell just by looking at the menu. My bourbon was absolutely perfection. I got my drink to match the scent in the room, which was smokey maple. One of the best drinks i've ever had and my friends agreed with theirs. The only negative i'll say is that the wait for the drinks was a bit long. Then waiting for the check was long as well. We did a lot of waiting and the place wasn't even packed. At the end of the day though, you're going for the drinks and they absolutely delivered!"}
{"text":"Cozy, dark, and lively place. The drinks are a bit expensive but quite worth it for the experience."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to check out Barchef last Friday evening with a friend before a night out on the town. You could easily pass right by it on Queen St West without knowing it was there. I met my friend just past 8 pm and we were quickly seated, it was busy but not that busy at the particular time. The place is dark with a modern decor and dimly lit with candles with a really cool and sexy ambiance.  Once we were seated, the server explained the drink menu to us and it was really nice that each table had a large glass jar of water. We decided on quite a few different drinks. The Sailor Moon Mojito ($25.00 plus tax), the Coconut Mojito ($14.00 plus tax), the Rocket ($14.00 plus tax), the Basil Daiquiri ($14.00 plus tax), Grolsch beer ($9.00 plus tax) and a few Gin and Tonics ($8.00 plus tax). The presentation of the cocktails were beautiful and most importantly the drinks were really well executed, a perfect balance of the flavour components, the sweet drinks were sweet but not overly sweet.  Barchef is definitely a unique establishment in Toronto that serves amazing cocktails that are beautifully presented, creative and well executed but are priced definitely at a higher price point in comparison to many other cocktail establishments in the city. I definitely recommend Barchef to anybody that is looking for a unique drinking experience. It's perfect for couples, first dates and even a few friends going out before a night out on the town."}
{"text":"So this is what it feels like to be in a hipster version of a James Bond movie. Shaken, not stirred? More like shaken AND stirred, because that's what you gotta do with some of their interactive, crazy concoctions. This is a classy and upscale establishment but not too upscale as our server (very nice) had no problem sporting a t-shirt with an armful of cool tattoos.   Came into this lounge on Saturday night with 4 friends and no line-up. The atmosphere was good, not too loud but with enough chatter to keep things interesting. Hopefully your phone has a light, because that's the only way you'll get to read the menu. And you'll definitely want to read the menu. It's got your classic cocktails and your beer/wine, but some items would leave you baffled with just the name (Mad Men? Spring Thaw??).  We each got a drink and the next hour was one of complete boozy relaxation.   Basil Daiquiri ($15): For a lightweight, this was danger in a glass cup. It tasted sweet, delicious, and had only the slightest hint of alcohol. I would've downed 3 before I knew what was happening, but luckily the price point stopped me.   Coconut Mojito ($15): Exotic and just as smooth as the Daiquiri. I had a couple sips of this and the only thing stopping me from trying more was my boyfriend's death glare as I drank from his glass.   Saffron Sazerac & Backwoods Boulevardier ($15): Both were categorized as \"sipping alcohols\", which means they're super strong. This was coming from two of my friends who could actually drink. They were apparently both great cocktails though.   Oceanic ($30): What was this weird aquatic contraption? It involved pouring some white chocolate liquid into a flowery ice disc that melted into a whirl of mist over some blue jelly and white foam. I'll tell you what it was, it was COOL.   Cedar ($25): How about a light snack with a glass of gin? They give you tiny pear discs with some white foam that's supposed to be \"cedar air\" on top unsweetened cocoa nibs that look like gravel. Taste-wise....eh. But you get to feel more in touch with nature, I guess.   My first visit has got me thinking about this place for days. BarChef has got something for everyone, and even something that no one would ever dream of. Sweet drinks, strong drinks, and drinks that spew out fog. Pick your poison and wash away your worries with each delicious sip.  (78/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"A-1  service! Quite pricey, but it was worth a visit. Our server was so sweet and nice :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, best cocktails I've had (not that i am a cocktail guy). Great for dates or groups. Its pricy but you know where your money went. Great service too."}
{"text":"overpriced, pretentious, way too hip, not enough substance and the cocktails certainly weren't as amazing as advertised."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I absolutely hate licorice flavor and therefore usually hate absinthe but the French absinthe and the presentation of it was amazing. Our waitress Felicia was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Barchef is the cool place to go where you always should make a reservation before heading there. They're almost always busy!   Fancy cocktails and sophisticated atmosphere, it works for small groups and big group gatherings. This is not a place you go to chow down shots. It's a nice you go to appreciate artistic drinks and sip slowly as the drinks are not cheap ( not crazy expensive either ).   If you haven't been, definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"A pal and I went out for long overdue drinks at Bar Chef on Saturday night. They don't take reservations so we went for 8:30 (it was freezing and we also didn't want to wait in line). Luckily, as soon as we arrived, we were seated at one of the small tables in the back. It gets very busy so don't be surprised if you have to wait. BC reminds me of bars that I've gone to in New York; it's unassuming from the outside, but when you go inside, it's dark with modern decor. The menu is extensive with a number of snack items along with mixed drinks and straight liqueur. I'm not usually a fan of mixed drinks, but the drinks listed were so unique that I was excited to try at least a couple. We opted for the $14 drinks (they can get more expensive based on how elaborate you go). I ordered the Coconut Mojito (2x) and Strawberry/Lavender (1x); both drinks were winners. After reading about the sliders, we wanted to order them, but they ran out so we had fries with rosemary mayonnaise instead. Service was excellent. I really enjoyed my experience here and can't wait to return!  Good for: drinks, celebrations"}
{"text":"amazing drinks here... i love everything i have tried here.. real artists doing their thang... i would love to see this business grow nationally!!"}
{"text":"This place is known for its \"modernist cocktails\" which I assume means \"order a drink and 30 minutes later a punchline from an episode of Portlandia will appear at your table.\"  This is a great concept in the following cases: 1. You are under 12 years old and find excessive use of dry ice exciting  2. You don't like drinking 3. You don't actually know what cocktails are  The cocktails we tried encompassed the full flavor spectrum between \"very sweet\" and \"extremely very sweet.\" Yech.  Would not return."}
{"text":"This is an extremely unique bar!  An upscale bar that combines art with their drinks! I came here towards the end of 2017, this place has a policy of seating you when 75% of your party has arrived - so if you know someone who show up late to hang out all the time, make sure you don't come until their here too, or else you'll be standing at the door for ages! The ambience of bar chef is an upscale dim lit spot for Toronto people to hang out after work or a fancier night out with friends.   I ordered the Pastels of Violette, which was \"A juxtaposition of the iconic London Fog featuring our vanilla bean charcoal cream, lavender infused orange'd cognac, juniper and rosemary, Earl Grey.\" I just checked out their recent menu and I didn't see it anymore - I guess it wasn't too popular of a drink.   Sitting down, I was fascinated by all the people who received their drinks and orders as their display of the drink is a work of art! Each drink comes with an additional piece and occasionally dry ice, which makes it even more fascinating.  When I finally got my drink, the hostess was explaining to me the drink very quickly as the dry ice began to dissipate - I wonder if they timed it, cause right after she said the last sentence, the dry ice was basically complete, and she took away the pretty art piece, leaving me with the drink only. I noticed that this seemed to happen with other tables. Frankly speaking, I wasn't even really listening to her speak as I was fascinated with this art piece, and was quite disappointed when I really only had 30 seconds with the piece before I was left with the drink only.   The drinks alone costing $25-$30, I would have appreciated if we would have more time with the art piece instead of promptly taking it away.   I personally was not a big fan of this drink myself. I felt that there was too much charcoal cream added to it that it had a burnt smokey hard taste when drinking this. I really like the lavender and earl grey mixture as it was really light."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I've only been here once and am basing my experience on this one (and only) visit.  1) From the moment you walk into the place (assuming you can find the little black door), it screams douche-baggery.  The bartender/servers with funny mysterious accents and the suit-only clientele confirmed my suspicions.  2) A $45 Manhattan?  Is this a joke?  For $45 there better be 5 oz of alcohol in this thing and be stirred with the bartender's diamond dick.  Ridiculous!  3) Hey suits, you mind not staring me down on the way to the bathroom? Thanks.  I would have headbutted you right then and there but you looked busy with your fellow suits giving you a reach-around.  Congratulations Barchef, you've just been blacklisted."}
{"text":"The drinks are not cheap. But let me tell you, that hickory smoke Manhattan is worth the hype.. at least for me.  I tried many drinks on the menu ( I'm not an alcoholic, just been there a few times), and it's a hit or miss for me. I didn't really enjoy the absinthe, but then again, it tastes like mouthwash everytime, and I don't know why I still order it. There's this lavender drink which I also didn't fancy. Overall, great atmosphere, excellent music and get the vanilla hickory smoke manhattan!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place without any preconceived notions and thoroughly impressed by the decor, service, drinks and music. It was swank and sheik and had the potential to be very pretentious but the 80's music from the DJ put our mind at ease. We didn't wait long to order though the place was packed. I told the bartender I just wanted his best rum drink he said ok without hesitation. I asked him if he preferred being called a mixologist. He said he was a bartender. A very good bartender. This place was rated one of 10 top bars in the world and it is deserved.  We were bar hopping but ended up closing this place out. Great vibe. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this place, it's appropriately dark, has a classy vibe but didn't feel pretentious because they had a pretty eclectic music playing loud enough not to be background noise, but not so loud that I had to struggle to hear my boyfriend.   I ordered an old fashioned and my date had a 472 (I think?).  The drinks were both tasty.  I'm not sure if they were understaffed, but the 5th star is missing because of exceedingly slow service.  We sat with empty drinks having asked for the bill for about 20 min, and we were seated at the bar.  We had plans to have another drink at another bar before our dinner reservation but by the time we waited 20 min and paid, we had to miss out.   Will definitely be back and hope it was a one-time thing!"}
{"text":"Oh the trials and tribulations of Barchef.  I want to love this place.  The first time I came here was on a Wednesday night, so there wasn't a huge crowd.   The drink menu is extensive, and that night we all decided to try a cocktail from their list, and then split a bowl of punch.  The cocktails were fantastic (I think I had one called Picasso's dream), and the punch was from outer space.  From that moment, I was in love.  Came back on Friday, and it was louder, but not terrible.  Still a bit difficult to chat, but we got another punch, the brandied Apple, and again it was delicious.  Their use of spices like cardamom, star of anise, and cinnamon, in a cocktail, is exceptional.  I thought to myself, \"I must bring my girlfriend here, I must bring my family here\".  But then my mood would change when I came back on Saturday night.  I return with my parents, who are in town for a Saturday, and some friends.  When we enter it's a half hour wait, which is totally fine.  But what's not fine is the unbelievable decibel level that the music is at.  I cannot say a single thing to anyone around me.  And at that moment we all decided to leave.  The drinks are good, but we enjoyed the drinks paired with a laid back atmosphere.  And at 12:45am at night on a Saturday, we were really hoping to get that atmosphere and drinks again, but instead ended up at a typical bar where you can't talk to anyone and just look at your phones or stare at each other because nothing you say can be heard by anyone.  So this place would have nailed 5 stars.  But it fizzled because I can't be in a place with music so loud it hurts my ears, where i cannot say anything to anyone.  If you just want a good drink, go here.  If you want a good atmosphere, go here on a weekday.  But if you want both, don't come here on the weekends."}
{"text":"So I had just come across some extra money and decided to go to barchef with some friends...being slightly tipsy already, I convinced a friend to buy a $45 cocktail so I wouldn't be the only crazy person at the table...That's right, a $45 cocktail!  I know by this point everybody thinks I'm crazy, but you know what, I have no regrets! The cocktail was delicious, presented beautifully, and is definitely something I can knock off the \"stupid things to spend money on before I die\" list.  Honestly though, the place has fantastic drinks and most fall between the $8-12 range, so don't be put off my craziness! Also, another thing I need to rave about is the sliders...my god they were soooo good...  This place is pretentious but the drinks and snacks are great...If you're up for a stylish night out, it's worth hitting up barchef!"}
{"text":"This place was super cool and the drinks were great but there's something about the lighting that needs to be turned up just a notch. The decor is all dark and moody and they pull it off amazing. But I felt like I couldn't see who was across from me... Thankfully they have this one lonely candle at the table, but at times when I was reading the menu I either had to be that obnoxious guy with his iPhone light on, or set the table on fire to have a bit of visibility. Either way the place is cool. Hipster crowd. Bartenders wear sick bow ties and suspenders. Drinks are like $10-15 and the service is good. Great spot for a drink after dinner someplace else. Or if you want an intimate spot to chill with someone who doesn't look very good in natural lighting."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!!!! Visited BarChef yesterday with my girlfriends.  Perfect place for night out!!!  Service was great! Girl was very polite, good knowledge of their menu. Didn't want to go through the menu and just told her what I was looking for. She got very well! Cannot complain! All cocktails were actually exciting to look at and drink!! Music was right for the mood of this place.  Suggestion - bar offers small plates so it's better to eat before coming;) P.S. one of the aspects for rating places is WC:)))  will give 5***** as well. Small but very clean....at least on Tuesday night;)))"}
{"text":"I was intrigued with the idea of the bar serving up mysterious smoky cocktails so came here to see what it was all about.  This place is DARK. As in you can barely see the face of the person across from you and you need to hold a candle up to the menu. I came with my girlfriends and we were not prepared for how intimate the setting was.. Probably not great for a first date or with people you are not that close with..  Nevertheless we knew we wanted to go for the modernist menu as that's what they are really known for:  Essence of fall ($30)- the plating of this drink was nuts! Very cool actually. I felt like I was transported to a forest that just experienced a rain drizzle. Such a strong pine and foresty smokey smell which I personally was not a huge fan of but my friend really liked. The drink itself was brandy and drew a really strong punch - clearly not for the faint of heart.   Sailors mojito ($25) - one of their most popular items. The mojo came with an interesting lime shot and the coveted smoke but other than that.. Not all that special.  Black truffle ($25) - coconut and elderflower liqueur, on the really sweet side and just as strong. It had spoonfuls of palette tasters on the side and was an interactive experience. Can't say it tasted good though..  In hindsight the lighter options such as the sweet & sour menu may have been a better choice for us since we are not used to straight hard liquor but I can say that I do appreciate the creativity of the place. But the reality that I just paid $30 for a single drink because the smoke and plating seemed a tad excessive to me."}
{"text":"Really cool place w/ upscale ambiance & very hip vibe. Expensive but good. Had the seasonal special & a drink in a coconut with pineapple snow which was great. One of the drinks was good initially but became overwhelming over time (it was a seasonal spice drink with cinnamon & other spices) Overall, it was a cool atmosphere & i wish i went with a bigger party on a weekend to really feel it."}
{"text":"My wife and I spent two hours at this bar and had an enjoyable time. It was busy but we didn't mind waiting 20 minutes for a table for two. We were glad we stayed!  The drinks were incredible and we were most impressed with the modernist revisions to old classics. The drinks were artistically presented with dry ice and were complimented with incredible extras - sand and coconuts for beach drinks, foliage with the Essence of Fall etc. The drinks were visually appealing, had complex aromas, and had intense flavours that transformed as you savoured them. By far, one of the best experiences I've ever had at a cocktail bar! Inventive gastronomic additions to the cocktails were pleasantly surprising and very complex. Everything worked!  When I had the Essence of Fall, it felt like I was sipping from a Group of Seven painting. We will definitely have multiple repeat visits!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Super original and awesome atmosphere.  they put a lot of work into perfecting their cocktails. It can be pretty pricey for their signature ones but definitely worth trying!! It's dark in their, mostly candle lit. Makes a really cool environment.  If you're afraid of the dark, probably not your scene. Theirs no ghosts or monster, just awesome cocktails!"}
{"text":"Nice bar, drinks are awesome for photo. A good place to chill with frds. They need to improve their snake options."}
{"text":"Best cocktail lounge I have been too, worldly cocktails prices range from $32-45, but they do blow your mind! Recommend this spot if you are looking for an upscale lounge."}
{"text":"Literally the best cocktail concoction I have EVER experienced. From the ambiance, the staff, the soaking/marinating bottles of indiscernible delights to be later added to the ingredients to imbibe...perfect. The presentation was impeccable, and every sip left my tastebuds screaming \"MORE!\" This wasn't just a drink, it was a lesson in imbibing."}
{"text":"If you want to have an exceptional experience, in every meaning of the word, you must check out BarChef!  Atmosphere:  The interior is cozy, dark, comfortable, and modern with a touch of old world class. The music is never too loud, and the  character of the space is hard to resist. Also, IT SMELLS AMAZING.   Service: I've been here handful of times and the servers/bartenders have always been friendly, helpful, very informative (they tell you about your drink, how to drink it etc), and the wait for your drink is never that long.   Drinks: Regarding the beverages, they're otherworldly. Think what would happen if Narnia + Wizard of Oz + Harry Potter were to combine in drink form. Basically, pure magick! Seriously.    Price: Yes, it is pricey... but I think that depends on how you look at the menu...  Menu:  -- Sweet & Sour $15: Many upscale bars in Toronto charge upwards of $17 - and they're basically just fluffy martinis you can find recipes for online. Here, $15 will get you something delicious, original, and most of all perfectly crafted.   -- Modernist $25 - $45 - When you hit the $30 range you're really in for a treat, I've had many off the Spring & Winter menus, they are a work of art. We're talking scented dry ice, melt in your mouth flavored 'snow' (it's not actually snow!), serving platters with sand, flowers, and branches.   -- Modernist $45 - Vanilla and Hickory Smoked Manhattan, which is to die for! It's presented on a pedestal, encased in a glass dome (where it 'smoked' at your table), and served in a heavy crystal goblet, with a large hand chipped ice ball. If you have the money, you MUST try it.   There is simply nothing like BarChef anywhere else in Toronto."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink with a friend early evening. Environment was quite dark, felt a little gothic and ominous. Bartender was attentive and fun. We sat at the bar and I had a Fig Thief. It was very complex and tasty. I am a big fan of their cocktail descriptions, informative but makes the drinks more approachable."}
{"text":"I was really worried after reading Kat's reviews, but I had a much better experience than others, probably because the place was EMPTY on Thursday night when I went. In fact, my friend and I were the very first customers when we arrived for an after-work beverage at 6:30pm. We were greeted by a very nice, very friendly British server with a wealth of knowledge about the menu. My friend ordered a Fig drink and I had a buttery bourbon drink. They infuse their liquors and add all sorts of fresh herbs and they are very original, clean and much more complex and layered than what I am used to drinking at bars. I also had a Four Seven Two, which was like a bourbon mojito - recommend! Another friend is quite picky (no fruit, only vodka) and they were very accommodating and made her a custom drink that she liked very much. As people have mentioned here before, the drinks are not cheap. I feel that the quality of the ingredients and the uniqueness of the creations make them worth it. The food is top-notch as well, and priced very reasonably. We had the frites with rosemary and mayo, and a cheese plate with 4 different cheeses, some olives, nuts, and figs and delicious toasted bread. All in all, I had a very good experience. You really can't bring someone who just drinks beer, or wine. You need to go with people who are willing to try something different. I'll be back, and I'll bring one of those people. I do feel like I may need to go back quite soon. We were there for a good two hours, and there were only a scattering of people there. Most of the other people were couples on dates, and they were young - early to mid twenties. I worry that on a Thursday night between 6:30-9, approximately 10 people were there, and we were 3 of them.  Go to Barchef so I can go again!"}
{"text":"Pricey but oh-so worth it. If you like your booze you must come here at least once. The infused cocktails are spectacles and the taste is incredible. I had the vanilla hickory old fashioned and the flavour still comes to mind when I think of it. An amazing, boozy marshmallow that will transport you to the campground of your dreams while you sit in a spiffy Queen West bar. I will most definitely be back for a special occasion or date night."}
{"text":"was very happy to stumble into this place friday night.  it was really great, and the scene was fun.  great drinks, and honestly so impressed by the cocktails.  you really ought to check it. can be a pain on the pocketbook, but if you go prepared you'll be fine and frankly, it's worth every cent.  we spent a lot of time there, and it can take some warming up if you're not already into the scene, but truly a lovely experience.  we only got there at 11pm or so, really have no clue how the whole happy hour/after work scene is there, and our snacks were minimal (edamame and pears/prosciutto). it's definitely darker than these photos, but it works.  came here after a dinner at peter pan, perhaps my favorite restaurant in all of toronto."}
{"text":"Loved my experience at BarChef!  This is not a place to hang out the entire night but more a place to start or end an evening because drinks are more expensive then other places in the city.  My friend and I each had a modernist cocktails because we were celebrating her birthday and wanted to experience something different.  I had the sailor's Mojito and it was delicious especially the edible part of the cocktail.  She had the Daiquiri Adaptation and again the edible part of the cocktail was memorable. Will keep this place on rotation but only for special occasions I would say."}
{"text":"So amazing. Social media worthy drinks, excellent food and exceptional service. Can not recommend highly enough. Just go!"}
{"text":"Most phenomenally exquisite bar I've been to in a long time!! Great staff, great atmosphere, amazing music and don't get me started on the drinks. Barchef takes mixology to a new level of sophistication! This isn't a place you go to just have a drink, this is a place you go to experience a drink. The molecular cocktails or \"modernist\" cocktails; as Frankie Solarik (mixologist extraordinaire) calls his concoctions, are something to behold. It is an experience for not just the pallet, but all senses on deck. Scent, sight, taste and even sound are all part of what makes Barchef like no other \"speakeasy\" style bar you've ever been in. With style and loads of class to go with it, you will not be disappointed with anything you order here. Be sure to try the molecular shots, such as the Sailors Mojito and of course imported Absinthe with authentic absinthe fountains imported straight from Paris (the only proper way to have a glass of the mystic green fairy). If Frankie co-owner and author of the best selling book \"The Bar Chef\",is behind the bar when you are there, feel free to let him freestyle your drink. He won't disappoint. be sure too pick up a signed book while you're there so you can have a little fun at home! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best, most unique bars in the whole of north America. I just ate my cocktail with chopsticks! An absolute must if in Toronto. Mind blown."}
{"text":"If you're into molecular gastronomy and booze and you've come to the right place. For cocktail drinkers like myself, it was like falling down the rabbit hole like Alice in Alice Wonderland. Every drink was unique and had it's own flavor. Presentation, taste, smell and texture, Barchef unites all your senses together for nothing less than an amazing experience. From serving regular cocktails for the less adventurous to the spectacular. Such as a coconut daiquiri served in a coconut, the form a granita and in jello form.  This is a must for all cocktail lovers who are feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"I have a lot to say about Bar Chef however if you are looking for a simple yes or no answer, then yes I would recommend trying it!   I've been following @barcheftoronto on Instagram for a couple weeks and the marketing of their \"modern takes\" cocktails are truly something to behold. The concept of bringing chef level creativity to the cocktail menu truly is unique and requires dedication and talent!  Knowing I would be in Toronto for a week, I was beyond excited to see what they had to offer sooner than later. I did not want to read any reviews in advance as I truly wanted it to be a first time experience.   Walking into the restaurant from the frigid 20 degree weather into a dark black candle lit room felt warm and mysterious. I was overwhelmed with feelings of pure excitement as we were escorted to our table. How can you not be intrigued by the assortment of drinks, the friendly smiles and the giant wall of house made bitters. Unfortunately this is where things took a bit of a turn. We were seated at the last table on the left of the restaurant, unlike the rest of the dimly lit landscape our table was overly bright with white lights reflecting from the bitters display case. I would have to imagine this is the worst seat in the house as it not only was too bright, but it spotlighted the extremely cheap and tacky chairs, tables and wall decor. Moreover the uninspiring plates for some of the appetizers we ordered in advance simply didn't match the extraordinary creativity of their signature cocktails we came there for. Additionally, although the wait staff was welcoming and informative, their execution from order to table was beyond poor. Some examples include the table being filled with finished appetizer plates and instead of taking them away before presenting our 25-30 dollar showpieces of a cocktail, they just slid and pushed them onto the table. Also as a rule of thumb they brought out my cocktail with the appetizers and I had to wait 15 minutes for my other two guests drinks to arrive before even trying mine. We had ordered 3 separate \"modernist cocktails\" so I'm sure some take longer than others but this was a huge mistake in my mind. It destroyed the opportunity to wow the entire table with (1) unveiling of each person's cocktail.   Our first cocktail and I would say best tasting was the \"Black Truffle\". It was more of a tasting experience than a drink but I absolutely loved It! The plating was elegant and the 5 individual soup spoons holding the individual mouthfuls were delicous. It was a perfect combination between sweet and savory and you could really taste the truffle. The dill as a garnish was perfect with the combined flavors!  Our second drink was my least favorite and was called \"Pear and Juniper\". Although the plating was artistic and beautiful, I found the Cocktail to be overpoweringly sweet. We weren't able to finish It.    \"Essence of Fall\", our third and most elaborate drink, was hands down the most impressive and unique drink I have ever been served. This drink represented the entire reason for us coming to Bar Chef. A punchy but sweet brandy served with a frozen ball of ice bitters (of which was delicious) combined with a gorgeous nitrogen show flowing through the miniature forest right on the table in front of us, was dreamy. The only thing that ruined this experience as I stated above were all the dirty plates surrounding and even placed in front of this culinary art piece.  There is no doubt in my mind that Chef Frankie is extremely passionate about what he does, you can see it in his eyes as he walks the floor asking every single table how their experience is and if they have any feedback for him. . I believe with a little more investment in the decor, serving plates and updated protocol on the front of the house, Bar Chef will be and even greater success. I am happy to have visited Bar chef and am looking forward to my next review!"}
{"text":"It's a cool place to go for eccentric drinks. Nice atmosphere inside. Service is good, food is nice as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely unique experience and delicious cocktails! This is the ultimate speakeasy bar which is oh-so one of a kind here in Toronto.   The spirit concoctions literally start up fireworks in your mouth! Love the dark, smokey atmosphere and decor- makes me feel like I'm at a turn of last century.    Been here over 4 times and this is one place I always bring my out-of-town family and friends to!   Stay fabulous guys!"}
{"text":"Frankie Solarik has made a name for himself as someone who has stepped out and helped the city step out from the shadow of new York and it's top bars. I love cocktails and fully appreciate places who are pushing things like Walker Inn in LA, The Aviary in Chicago and here at BarChef in Toronto.   Convincing my Hamiltonian friends to tag along with me on my cocktail adventures was not hard seeing as we were here already, but having hit multiple breweries and multiple cocktail bars already we decided to make this our last stop knowing nothing would really top this. We saved the best for last. We came in on a weeknight and were seated without a wait. The dark interior set the ambiance and because the drinks are so captivating the only real way to experience them (it goes beyond garnish and plating) is belly up at the bar. Chatting with the staff we bro'd up pretty quickly and the veil of servitude was gone and it was a little more omakase in that we weren't to be one of the cool kids or just to have drinks we'd never had before. I was here to learn, pick the brains of others and not have this catered experience. We actually didn't indulge in many from the modernist drinks finding the dog and pony show to not be worth the added experience, cost and time.  We started with the spirit forward sipping menu which mentions tasting notes. That helps keep things approachable for the novice who may not put flavors and ingredients together the way chef's and bartenders do, but we were also trying to limit our bar tab. We knew we couldn't last long considering the hundreds of dollars of alcohol we'd each already consumed that day. I found the Pear & Rosemary to be aromatic af. Not overpowering, but in that way you can taste it before you drink it. Symphony No 5 was spot on 5 distinct flavors in balanced harmony. I'll order anything with Chartreuse tho. Dark Necessities kind of threw me off as I don't find the flavors of violet to match with cacao. Rosemary and Maraschino didn't do it for me. I get the concept, but think the execution needed refinement.   We had elyx a single farm vodka which is velvety and will breed a new batch of drinks or at least elevate the category. Valentine Gin was juicy and bursting with flavor. Plantation's 20th year XO was superb, just too good to mix. Eldo 21 year was the perfect balance of age and price, smooth, a hint of extinguished aromatics roasting. I was actually not impressed with their bourbon/whiskey selection relying heavily on readily available offerings like too much Evan, Jim, W.L. Weller, Crown, Club and not enough higher proof, more rare stuff. I get that it's not a whiskey bar, but I really wasn't sure what they were going for in terms of backbar stock. I was very interested in the Dillon's absinthe as I visited the distillery in Grimsby and they did not have it, so it's a private offering. Unlike Dillon's gin's the mouthfeel was great, but to me lacked the vegetal notes and may have been too floral.   We stayed away from the snacks as it seems like Canada is heavy on charcuterie and I find it's not ideal for cocktail pairings. Of the modernist drinks we did have Sailor mojito which gave just enough style, but to me I didn't get the pronounced acidity. Daiquiri adaptation fell flat being pretty \"just tiki\". The daiquiri is the standard and I didn't feel this elevated it. Black Truffle had great balance of salt, coconut liqueur, but the elderflower was out of place. Essence of Fall was just for the garnish and to have another sphere ice drink. At this point we went to spirits and classics having had enough for one night. Excellent and to spec.  We are right on the limit as we leave having found a new level in rallying multiple times in the day and seeing diminishing returns we also had to make the train. We bid adieu and talked of future trends thanking them for letting us step foot into their creative space. Too often innovation is not appreciated in part because it's not focused and thought to be just creativity for it's own sake. Not here at Barchef. Yes you can come and have drinks you've never had before and come here because it's cool, but it's cool for different reasons and the more you dissect that the more you will appreciate the elevations."}
{"text":"A wonderful place for a romantic drink and getting to know someone. Drinks are served in edged glass and some drinks ie. Aviation is served with fumes coming out. Service is fast and diligent. Ambiance is warm and classy. However the tables are very close together. Too close for a private conversation."}
{"text":"One of the best places for cocktails in the Downtown Toronto area.  I've been here 3 times throughout 2014 - 2015 and this place has never failed to disappoint me. The cocktails range from extravagant cocktails with dry ice trailing the server to plain but tasty \"mixed drink\" style cocktails. I usually prefer sweeter cocktails, so I stick with the \"Sweet & Sour\" portion of their menu. I highly recommend the Strawberry Sour - the egg white foam topping on the cocktail really makes the experience. Overall, the higher prices are justified.   The service is also spectacular. I was debating between two cocktails - The Gala and The Toasted Fizz, and the waitress was immediately able to provide a contrast of the cocktails which made my choice a lot easier. The waitresses here really know their cocktails.  Tip - For those in groups, I recommend going for the punch bowls because of the value. Although the drinks feel a little more watered down because of the ice in the punch bowls, this is a great way to share in a larger group."}
{"text":"Dark, cosy, and romantic, this place is a place you take someone when you want to impress them!    Located on Queen W, it looks unassuming from the outside, but walk inside and you are in another world   The service is really friendly in here.  There are sofa/lounge type seating in the front and in the middle/back of the place there are tables and there is one big communal table at the back (beside the bar).  The drinks are why people come here - they are unique and interesting.  I had the Rocket - tastes exactly like my favorite old school popsicle the Rocket!  Other drinks come with flowers, tree branches, smoke, yes all those tricks of the drinks you see on tv.   The prices of course match.  So have a drink, nurse it well and enjoy your time here."}
{"text":"My journey in Toronto to visit some excellent restaurants and bars, while there for work, continued at Barchef the night after Marben.    I am a huge fan of specialty cocktails, mixology, etc., so I wanted to see what Toronto had to offer.  Could it compete with San Francisco?  I had to find out.  I started to research places and came across Barchef.  The word was solid and so I started to look at the menu.  I came to the infamous \"Molecular\" section of the menu and Barchef now had my undivided attention.  Vanilla Hickory Smoked Manhattan Crown Royal Cask 16 In-House Cherry Vanilla Bitter, Hickory Smoked Syrup, Vanilla Cognac, Smoked Hickory and Vanilla $45  Hang on a second...$45...I'm confused...that can't be right.  But it is accurate.  I've never paid $45 for a cocktail.  I had to think about this one and then do a little more research.  I just couldn't understand how a Manhattan, of all drinks, could cost that, let alone be worth that.  But as I read more about Barchef, I kept coming across reviews with the same themes. They were shocked at first, but took the plunge and were ultimately completely won over.   I was still skeptical, but even more curious now.  So at this point, I had to have this drink. And thus began another day of telling everyone one I was with, every hour on the hour, that I needed this $45 Manhattan.    So I finally made it to Barchef.  The time had come to order my much dreamed about Vanilla Hickory Smoked Manhattan.  And I won't bore you with every step of the experience and also to leave a few surprises.  But the thing is, it is just that.  An \"experience.\"  It was a perfectly executed, masterfully crafted cocktail, that from the moment it is delivered to the table, to the final sip, that is just as amazing as the first, does not disappoint for a second.  It had won me over.  The $45 Manhattan experience was worth it.  No regrets.  Out of the five other folks that had one along with me at the table, I can definitively say that no one was disappointed, and everyone was extremely impressed.    Add to this, excellent service, nice lounge atmosphere and a variety of small plates perfect for sharing and not to mention, delicious, the result was nothing short of another well deserved 5 Star Yelp Review.  Barchef made quite an impression.  They know how to give SF cocktails a run for their money in my opinion. Well done!"}
{"text":"The modernist drinks here are quite an experience. I spent $25 on the Sailor's Mojito which was the best money I've ever spent on a cocktail. This drink, described as \"beach essence, sailor jerry rum, mint, fresh lime, vanilla syrup, mojito ravioli, fresh lime and vanilla air,\" engages almost all of your senses. I really enjoyed the vanilla air and the mojito ravioli which enticed my sense of sight, smell and taste. The mojito ravioli, which was molecular fun, was unlike anything I've ever had before.   I also tried one of the sipping cocktails, the Apricot Sazerac, which was beautifully balanced, with the apricot adding a lovely flavor.   The dark, relaxed ambiance of the bar is the perfect setting for such well executed and inventive drinks. Also, they play a good mix of music from different genres. On top of that, service was excellent and when you ask the bartenders questions about the menu, in the way that they describe and explain the drinks, you can see that they truly enjoy their craft.   All of this just goes to show why BarChef is one of the best bars in the world."}
{"text":"Here it is.. my long awaited Birthday Review @ Barchef!... being someone who's up for new experiences, I wanted to find a place that would be a good atmosphere, and most importantly good drinks for me and my friends as I had not celebrated my birthday with them in Toronto for THREE YEARS!  I had read somewhere that Barchef was one of the top 100 experiences in the ENTIRE WORLD! That's pretty epic and it made me even more excited!  Getting all dressed up and wanting to make sure that I was going to secure enough seats for our crowd, I arrived in an empty bar at 8pm (they opened at 7 on Saturday). The room was dark, but classy and the waitress lit the tealights so we could see in the back. The bar was lined up with house made bitters and a large assortment of alcohol in the back.  My first drink was the strawberry lavender - strawberry infused lavender and elderberry bitter, lavender infused grand marnier, lime, and lavender sugared rim.... the drink was sweet, but not too sweet with lovely hints of lavender. The sugared rim definitely added to the overall flavours and for $12, I was happy. Throughout the night, I had the opportunity to sip some of my friend's inventive concoctions:  - Coconut mojito - made with coconut milk, it was very creamy, and minty at the same time... perfect for a dessert.  - Barchef Rocket - definitely tasted like a blue raspberry popsicle. Too sweet for me, but lived up to what it was meant to be.  - Sake Sour - by far the best drink I had that night out of the standard cocktail list - made with sake, cardemom cumin syrup, lime, egg white, apricot bitters, coconut rum and thai basil sugar rim. The egg white froth was fluffy with a hint of burntness that reminded me of creme brulee. I never wanted the drink to end.  Although I was very interested in the $45 vanilla smoke hickory manhattan which is smoked in hickory chips, it really was not my kind of drink........ instead, I was drawn to the Sailor's mojito @ $20. I was told that it would make me feel like I was at the beach! I watched as the bartender took the time to make this piece of art.. and lastly, he took out the liquid nitrogen and poured it into this little dish. It smelled of the beach and suntan lotion.. pretty impressive I must say. It also came with a mojito ravioli on a spoon. Not sure what the wrap was made of but when I put it in my mouth, this lemon juice and flavour bursted in my mouth. It was sweet and powerful, full of flavour and excitement! The mojito was smooth and very consistent in taste, not what I usually find in other mojitos where I have to crush the mint to enhance its flavours time and time again. It was definitely a must -try experience.  By the end of the night, the place was packed, the music was pumping and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.. I'd definitely want to come back to try all their other inventions.. I mean, how could I not?"}
{"text":"Why do people go here? I don't understand. The cocktails? Yeah those are great, but they are not worth the price. I make a better mojito than the ones they make here and the only thing I'm lacking is some fake smoke created via dry ice. They're literally charging you like 20 bucks for a drink because there's some smoke coming from the tray. I don't understand it.   I don't think this place has any character. It's nice inside, cozy and dimly lit. If i was going out with some balla like Jay Z i would let him take me here. But otherwise, I would just go to the Hideout, drink and enjoy myself somewhere without praying that I don't max out my credit card paying my bill.  PS I had the apricot something or other, it was pretty much two ounces of really sweet and spicy liquor. Yuck."}
{"text":"I go here because I am pretentious, better dressed, more well-read, and perhaps more educated than you to use another Yelper's words.    The drinks are fantastic.  There are only a couple of places in town that serve drinks like this.  Anything added to your drink was made from scratch including sweeteners, emulsifiers, and bitters.  Many of their drinks are \"molecular\".  Without getting in to details, fire is usually involved.  Great care is taken for every drink made.  Because of this service can be a bit slow but it is worth it.    The people there can be a little pretentious but it is pretty obvious who is there to show off and who is there to enjoy a drink.  It is easy to start up conversation there since everyone is drinking something interesting and wants to talk about it."}
{"text":"After years of wanting to visit, I finally did. Everything about this place is an experience and the drinks live up to the reputation. The Four Seven Two was a good start (almost like training wheels) and the Fig Thief (bartender Mateo's specialty) is a cocktail which I could've had two of. Can't cry at all about the Japanese Fried Chicken, either. This place is definitely worth the experience.  UPDATE: Drinks Review  Mad Man -- Rather interesting twist on the Manhattan. It took me a while to get used to the sippy straw but after a while you get the swag goin'. Points for sheer creativity on this one.   Vanilla/Hickory Manhattan -- THIS is a drink that demands your respect. Yes, you're paying a bit for the process but even without it, it could easily be a $30-35 drink. It's like sipping on a toasted marshmallow (cuz there's no way you're chugging this)."}
{"text":"Fun place! Really cool vibe, good music and even better cocktails. Obviously, the cocktails are expensive but you should be aware of that before you walk in.. You're paying for an experience, not just a drink. I had the hickory smoked Manhattan, which is their signature drink. I really enjoyed the presentation, and you could definitely taste the smokiness, it was great. I also had the coconut mojito, which is more of a regular cocktail but delicious as well. I wouldn't expect amazing service.. The service was good but they're not especially attentive or friendly. However, the place was really busy so it was understandable. Oh, we were also brought this really cool free snack at the end (I guess we spent over a certain amount?)... Nice gesture! Overall, I enjoyed myself and will definitely return in the future!"}
{"text":"Came here on my first night out in Toronto and was thoroughly impressed. A trendy bar with excellent food and service. What's not to love?  Ordered the shrimp tacos and fries along with a bottle of champagne. Was not expecting much from bar food, but holy moly!!!!!!!! Quite possibly the best shrimp tacos I've ever had in my life! I highly recommend getting them :)  Service was excellent. Our bartender left us with the best first impression of Canadians :)  Perfect date night spot or a girls night out. 10/10 would come again.. and get those damn shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"Learned about this cocktail bar on Yelp a long while ago and I finally got to try it on my birthday.  It was indeed a wonderful cocktail experience.  I'm so glad Toronto has such a unique and amazing cocktail bar.  I would give Barchef a 6 stars if it will open at 6pm instead of 7pm!  I hope you hear me.    The decoration was very classy though the lighting was a little too dark to read the menu.  Service was good and drinks were amazing to the taste and, of course, to the presentation!  I ordered the most expensive cocktail in my life, but it was definitely a lifetime experience. The Essence of Fall, I will always remember you.    There are less expensive cocktails on the drink menu I have to try on my next visit."}
{"text":"Very cool place. I love the interior (Very dark, lots of candles, black/leather furniture). Amazing!  I went last night (valentines day), and they gave out a free complimentary martini which was nice.  The food is pretty good here! If I wanted to nit pick, I would say that the hamburgers could have used some lettuce or something (to give it some crunch), and the arancini (risotto balls) could have used a little more salt (bland). Otherwise food was great. I recommend the olives!  The drinks were nice, some better than others. They have some interesting things that you couldn't find anywhere else, but in the end everything is quite average with a couple of twists here and there. The molecular drinks are fun as well (great presentation).  So in the end, it's a great place to bring friends (birthday, a quick \"dinner\"/drink, etc). But come with a big wallet :) because the most expensive thing for what you get, is the food. So if your hungry, just be conscious about how much everything costs!  Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"A special place.   One of those places you MUST go to at least once in your life. Yes, this bar has molecular mixology cocktails, but honestly it is also just a really good bar. Some of my favorite cocktails were things I ordered on the $8 tues-thurs menu!  I did have the Sailors Mojito and it was glorious. You really get your $25 worth.   One of my favorite things about the bar was our bartender who was totally unpretentious and very friendly. We chatted with her for a long time and honestly I would have gone back if I had time on my trip."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night, so it wasn't too busy. The interior is has a really comfy, and classy vibe. It's super dim lit, and there are cushy couches scattered about. This seems really nice place to go with a date for a long chat.  I had one of the sipping cocktails, but be warned - these cocktails aren't for the type of people who like fruity drinks. I had the \"Symphony no. 5\", and it was definitely the most unique drink that I've ever had. It was an incredibly complex drink, with ingredients such as vanilla brandy and orange blossom water. It also had this medicinal taste to it, but not in a bad way.  Next time I go back I'll want to try one of the modernist cocktails. Someone in the bar ordered the signature Vanilla and Hickory Smoked Manhattan and the scent just filled up the place.  Overall, the bartenders are really experienced, the drink are incredibly imaginative, and the atmosphere makes for a great time overall."}
{"text":"I try not to review places based on one visit, but this place left a particularly bad taste in my mouth. Maybe I am just not trendy enough to understand why I should be paying 15 dollars for a drink.  I came here on a Wednesday night and it was full of bar owners and 22-year old drunk girls. It took forever for the bartender to even ask us for a drink because he was too busy trying to impress everyone with his flaming brandy and dry ice. Seriously, he took 20 minutes to make one drink for some rich suit and it had dry ice served in a bowl. Maybe this sort of thing is cool for people who have seen it all, but I would have been more than happy if he just pulled a beer out of the fridge and popped off the cap.  While the bartender took his sweet time making drinks the owner explained to his \"clients\" what he was doing. It was as if I walked in on some bartending convention that I was surely not a part of. I felt uncomfortable and out of place. I finished my 15 dollar drink (which just tasted like alcoholic Kool-Aid) and was out the door -- heading to a place where I wouldn't be looked down upon.  This used to be a jazz bar before it was Bar Chef and I would always walk by thinking the place looked cozy and interesting. I regret not checking it out back then because I'm surely never coming back here. If you are a big spender and want to pay extra for snobby service then by all means this is your place."}
{"text":"When we first got there, we noticed the door painted in black with no windows. I felt like I was walking into a prestige VIP club. You probably wouldnt walk into this place unless u knew about it. We were seated in no-time. Surprising as it was a sat night at 10pm. It definitely got busier after 11:30pm. The place is dimly lit with very loud music of various genres. We orderd the sailor mojito and Scottish breeze to start.   The sailor mojito definitely lived up to the hype and reviews. It definitely touched all my senses as per the website.  Atheistically, it looked amazing. The dry ice let out a beautiful breezy smell. The drink tasted fantastic, a touch of sour, sweet and minty. The moment The mojito rivolio touched the mouth, the richness of the drink bursted out sending all my taste buds to heaven. As the waitress was describing the drink, I felt immense excitement and pleasure to try the drink. A+ for activating all my visceral sensations! $25  Scottish breeze: it had a strong black licorice taste which seemed to mask the taste of the alcohol.no fancy presentation like the modernist cocktails, but it was \"only\" $14. B+  We ended up splurging and ordering the spring thaw after. This definitely lived up to the name of the drink. The presentation was really cool. When the waitress poured some liquid on the moss that surrounded the drink glass, the dry ice smoke came out and it smelled like a forest. The drink itself was ok - it had a bitter citrus Taste. We didnt like the taste as much as The sailor mojito, but The presentation was cool. Definitely felt like spring with this drink.. A- $25  Overall, this place is a must-try. I probably wouldn't go back unless they updated the modernist drinks since it's pricey and the novelty would wear off after awhile. However, a great place to take someone for a special occasion or an out of town guest."}
{"text":"This is one of my top cocktail lounges - and ice been to many in Canada and the US. This was my second visit and it won't be my last. The staff, the decor, the bartenders, the DRINKS - it's all amazing. The thought and artistry they put into these cocktails is insane. Pretty much 70% of our conversation the whole night was about our cocktails."}
{"text":"Their Modernist cocktails are the equivalent of molecular gastronomy for cocktails. Inventive and delicious. Each comes with three parts that stimulate the senses of sight, smell and taste."}
{"text":"*300th review*  BarChef is a destination cocktail bar where their modernist cocktails will appeal to your five senses. You can see it, smell it, touch it, taste it, and hear it. Ok fine, the last one isn't true... but you can definitely hear me saying, DAYUM that's one sexy ass cocktail!!  Highly recommend ordering the Spring Thaw ($35) for your first-time visit. It legit came with a floral arrangement and dried ice (really cool fog effect). I honestly felt like I won an award because the presentation was so big and flashy!! The actual drink tasted floral and refreshing, and there was a fruity liquor-infused ice ball that reminded me of an alcoholic SLUSHY (the kid in me was very giddy). My husband tried the Toasted Islay (pronounced eye-la), a more manly, sipping cocktail, and was definitely wowed by the complex notes.  5-star service from the staff and bartenders, who were not pretentious at all. They won't judge you for taking 100 pics of your drinks either. Similar to high-end restaurants, the server will describe the different components of your drink upon serving. Also, worth mentioning: the space was gorgeous and romantic.   If you are a cocktail enthusiast, celebrating a special occasion, trying to impress your date, or just need a photo for the 'gram, then a visit to BarChef is a MUST! It was my fave part of my Toronto trip, and I'd definitely return next time.   Pro-tips:  1. Go during warm summer nights for no/shorter wait; I guess everyone headed to rooftop bars instead. 2. Follow them on Instagram @barcheftoronto for secret-menu/exclusive items! You're welcome."}
{"text":"Pretentious and expensive, but the mixology and ambiance are at least worth one visit if you haven't been."}
{"text":"I been coming here on a very regular basis and is always impressed.   Service: Amazing...from the hostess who seats you, to the bartenders always very friendly. Even Frankie comes up and chats with everyone.   Very knowledgable in recommending drinks, and just making it feel very warm. Bartenders do a great job of explaining the drinks to you.  Drinks: Some of the best drinks i had.  I usually am a scotch/bourbon whiskey type guy. that being said. ORDER the sailor mojito shots.   5 bucks...and they taste amazing There in house made bitters for me are amazing as i do like  a strong drink.  The kensginton and symphony #5 are my fav.  But the Mad men..something to be experienced Now those drinks are not for everyone, but girls i go with usually love the Rocket or there Daquiri.  The Manahatan for 45 bucks, looks cool, presentation is amazing..but honestly not for everyone.  First time there with a bunch of ppl, just order one for the table, take a few pics.   Myself..i love it as I mentioned...whisky drinker :)  If your not..this super strong drink isn't for you.  Food: Some good little apps, the pakaros are great...but lets face it..this place is not meant for food.  Overall...have to try it once.  You may be like me coming back regular.  The menu is always changing (Frankie actually let us try a sneak sample of a new drink...i swear its like dessert lol) Price wise..a little more than other places on queen W, but not bad relative to downtown toronto, as drinks average 15-25 dollars. Of course there are some higher ones.   But they are a healthy dose of alcohol...I personally say its worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome and unique experience I suggest everyone pays a visit of this restaurant. My drink was amazing definitely mesmerizing!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest... I got suckered into this gem after seeing a viral social media video float around about this spot. I've had it bookmarked on Yelp for about a year (at least) so when I found out I was going to Toronto, you best believe this was the first place that came to mind.  I was like a kid who couldn't sleep on Christmas Eve in anticipation of Santa Clause breaking into my house to leave presents. When the day finally came- you best believe I built my day around BarChef to amp up the anticipation.  BarChef is truly an experience on its own and I'm so happy I was able to experience it firsthand. Not only is the customer service SUPERB but the ambiance is hard to replicate.  Upon entering and snagging two chairs at the bar, my friend and I took a gander around to understand the dynamic of BarChef. You're approached by craft experts who take pride in knowing what each bottle, bitter, ingredient is kept behind the bar (and kitchen). We've all been to some upscale bars but the allure of BC was one of my faves. It's like a live interpretation of a set inside an Edgar Allen Poe literature piece where their drinks are a combination of art and science.   There are small bites available to keep you through the dinner hour, but the main star of the show is their Modernist Cocktails.  Be warned these cocktails are not your average spend but the presentation alone is worth every penny. I was enamored with the description of the \"Essence of Fall\" drink and was ready/excited to bite the bullet of the $30 CAD price tag.  (I had a few more drinks after this one and my tab was more than fair! They have regular priced cocktails too so no worries.)  Their Modernist Cocktails have a strong stance on presentation and I encourage you to look over all the details before you take a sip or go snap crazy on your phone. It's dimly lite inside the bar so please ask if you can take a photo before blinding the folks next to you... It's just common courtesy.  While my drink was prepared in the Kitchen, the staff explained to me the different senses which would be heightened upon delivery of my drink.  I still remember them pouring the hot tea into the forest which had a lovely aromatic scent that lingered around me. From the smoke of the forest cascading down to the bar table towards me, I was being taken to a new micro-place. I kept gandering at the forest in front of me holding my drink asking myself if I was ready to drink the elixir provided by Artemis.  These drinks are boozy as hell so don't go chugging it like any other cocktail. It'll smack you right across the face before you know it. I had the luxury of seeing my friend make this mistake with his. He opted for the Apricot which had nitrous balls for consumption.   What was pretty neat about \"Essence of Fall\" where all the edible elements in the presentation. From the flowers to the \"clouds\" each had its own distinct flavor. Also, make sure to take your time enjoying this drink as the nodes change throughout time. The cocktail is like a frozen ball but every sip was like taking a drink from the Greek God's goblet.  I'll be back BarChef and can't wait to see what new adventures await for me..."}
{"text":"Great place for a date thanks to the showy drinks and dim lighting. Sit close and share."}
{"text":"I loooooooved BarChef! My friend and I arrived after 11pm on a Friday night. It was busy and we were lucky to get the last two seats at the bar. Water served immediately upon being seated along with a carafe for refills. Our bartender's name was Mateo and he was so genuinely friendly and nice. He explained the menu to us and gave us a few minutes to decide on a cocktail. They have a great selection of spirits and the vibe and decor reminded me of a speakeasy. Our plan was to bar hop that night since we were only in town for the weekend, but we ended up staying put because we enjoyed it so much. Good mix of people, smart casual dress, dimly lit. Not pretentious at all.   My cocktails were so delicious! They infuse their liquors in-house, as witnessed by the entire back wall shelving filled with jars of all sizes labeled with the infusion and date. I had a gin infused with strawberry and another gin infused with lemongrass. Presentation was A+. They use a lot of dry ice and essential oils in their specialty cocktail presentations which makes for a fun show and pleasant aroma. Reasonably priced as well. Love the different glass styles for each drink. They fashion their large ice spheres by hand from a large chunk of ice that sits out on the bar. They do have a tapas-style menu, however we only had libations.   Great spot. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place is so unique and special!  Yes the drinks are on the expensive side, but it is the experience and presentation that suggests a higher quality and price point. The menu is filled with works of art that are edible and drinkable. I love the multi sensory experience of aromatics, presentation, and texture that Bar Chef masterfully evokes.  So much fun and a great bar to celebrate something special."}
{"text":"One of my complaints about Toronto when I first moved here was that I could not get a decent drink. Everyplace I went to either watered down their drinks or put too much of the liquors in to save money on bases. So when I heard about Bar Chef, I was cautiously interested. Would they screw it up or come through?  While I can't lie and say that they measure up to truly great places (Alembic in SF or Violet Hour in Chicago), they are doing pretty decent (said with understatement). LCBO has dealt them a crap hand by not importing a lot of the more interesting liquors being used in other cities (Maraschino LIquor, Creme d'Violette, Applejack don't even get me started about the lack of a good gin selection) but they are making due with what they have. I think that comprises about 1/2 a star above/ A trip to the bar will show that they are making bitters and syrups themselves and making the effort to make infused brandies, gins, and vodkas.   Looking at some of the other reviews, it seems like there has been some negative attitudes or service encountered. I've never had a problem with any of the people I have encountered there but I also make an effort to go on weeknights when it is a little slower. If you go while it is slower on weeknights you can avoid amateur hour and get a little bit more time to ask about more obscure things not on the menu, what might be in a drink or suggestions for things to make at home.  I'll close out on a suggestion: more bourbon and whiskey drinks. All the gin and vodka drinks are great in the summer but not as much in the cold winter.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place is steps away from my condo and I think it's the coolest bar in the city. They make drinks that are scientifically capable of enlightening your tastebuds.  :). Some nights they have a DJ spinning wicked tunes.  Love love love it!"}
{"text":"We had finished a very tasty meal at Loka and were looking for somewhere to grab a post-dinner drink (and maybe even more food) when I remembered wanting to try BarChef. We walked in and I was immediately thrilled with our choice. It was dark and loud and exactly what I was in the mood for.  We were seated at the bar and presented with an extremely extensive menu. The drinks are all quite innovative and different and I wound up getting two:  Scotch Bramble (\"Orange Scotch, honey and black pepper syrup, fresh lemon, cherry and vanilla bitter, tonic water, bitter almond\"): Though perhaps a touch sweeter than I would've liked, this was definitely a very flavorful and potent beverage that was incredibly easy to drink.  For my next drink, I noticed that they had a handful of varieties of absinthe on the menu and since I'd never tried the notorious drink, I had to order one. (I went with the Dillon's.) The bartender first brought out this elaborite statue-type thing that contained icy water, and we first thought we were meant to refill our water glasses. But when the drink came out, complete with the cube of sugar above the glass, it became clear it was meant to drip water into the beverage and dilute it to my preference.  It is, as expected, an extremely strong drink. I was basically coughing after every sip but I enjoyed it. It's so different from anything I've ever had before. And the presentation was certainly quite stellar.  We also decided to order a couple of dishes to snack on:  Croquettes (\"mushroom and prosciutto\") and Japanese Fried Chicken (\"soy and sesame\"): Both of these items were just about perfect and completely hit the spot. They arrived piping hot, too, so that's always a plus.  Now, the big downside to our experience was after we had received our food and second drinks we were literally ignored by our server for the rest of the night. We would've ordered a third drink each but the bartender was too busy with other orders to check on us. We finally grew so annoyed we just wanted the bill but still he didn't check in with us at any point, even after we were sitting there in our coats. Finally we flagged him down, which I hate to do because it just seems aggressive, and asked for our bill, although I'll admit I was tempted to just walk out. Is it really theft if you're not given an opportunity to pay?  It was a horrible ending to what was otherwise a superb experience. Much as I love the vibe and offerings in there I doubt I'll ever return."}
{"text":"I had the chance to share three cocktails amongst my party and have to say the creations of the drinks are designed to be \"unique\" but nothing really special that would bring me back at $25-50 a cocktail. The service was good, our bartender explained each drink and was attentive. I believe the the bitters are made in house which is a bonus, however the crowd were beyond our years (We're in our early 30s) and would be the primary reason for not returning."}
{"text":"Really nice bar to go to, love the music and the unique variety of drink they have . It's a must !!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! My boyfriend and I were visiting Toronto, and I did some major searching to try to find an awesome place to get a drink before we headed to Lee for dinner. Barchef kept coming up as an amazing cocktail lounge, so we decided to try it out, and I wasn't disappointed!   We are from Chicago, and have been to Aviary started by Grant Achatz - this place is basically the pioneer of molecular drinks, cool presentations - the \"experience\" of drinking. Also connected with Alinea. Needless to say - Barchef had some big shoes to fill!   We sat at the bar, and I decided to go all in, and ordered one of their molecular drinks - I told our awesome bartender Keely the flavors I liked, and she recommended the Cedar. It was SO good, and the presentation was amazing - they had their own interpretation of the forest presented beside the drink - all edible ingredients that were supposed to bring out the flavors in the drink - amazing! I can't remember the drinks my boyfriend got, but he loved them equally as well. Not to mention they make all their own bitters and mixers here, and they are all beautifully lined up on the bar - I highly recommend sitting at the bar so you can see all the magic happen!   The owner Frankie was there that night and said hi to us - the vibe, drinks, service, etc. here is top notch. If you want an experience please go here!"}
{"text":"Craft cocktails that will definitely impress you! They think of everything for each drink."}
{"text":"When I think of summer drinking in Toronto, invariably I think of the Mojito at Barchef. It is may be the most photographed drink in the whole bar. The molecular gastronomy component, dry ice beach and actual libation, all of it is art, wrapped up in sophistication, enveloped in the darkness that is Barchef. It's naughty, it's sexy and it beckons one to drink it.   The drink pretty much summarizes Barchef for me, and I've been here on various occasions -- with girlfriends, large groups, family, and out of town guests. Never have I had a bad experience. They offer drinks of every liquor base, house-infused syrups and something for everyone - everyone willing to shell out 3 digits for the bill of course.   There is always a house DJ on Thursday night and weekends are always packed, so come prepared to fight the noise and crowd. Punch bowls are whipped out and sparklers fill the space. One of my favourite drinks is always something with elderflower or fruit syrup, but the martini three ways will always blow you away. Either with caviar, olives or rosemary foam, it is consistently impressive every time.   Despite their great drink menu, the food menu pales in comparison, but it's not too far to fall. I love the lobster poutine and their cheese plates, with the ever present balsamic vinegar jelly. I would warn against ordering a charcuterie plate. If you're hungry, there are plenty of cheaper and more filling options along this strip of Queen.  If you're looking to impress real cocktail aficionados, steer away from the Ritz, Barchef is THE place in town."}
{"text":"This place is class! I finally had the chance to go with my artists after work and while it was more just to hang out, we had a great experience! Right from the start, our beautiful hostess (I know her name but out of respect of privacy I won't mention) was able to get us a booth seating. Very comfortable and relaxing environment. The drinks list is extremely creative! I had the fox tail and it's a sipping type of drink and it was very tasty and strong. However, be prepared to shell out money in this place. While they have a regular drink menu, they have their specialty drinks list, which is the sole purpose of going to Barchef in the first place. The staff there are extremely pleasant! Great smile, great attitude.   Overall it was an awesome place! This is the kind of place that you wanna take your date with you, or spare the moment to try out the menu. Once again, if you're looking for just a whiskey and coke kind of drink and don't want to pay a lot of money, go elsewhere. Come here for the experience that you won't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"One of the most interesting and unique bars in Toronto. Definitely love the concept of their unique drinks. Very expensive but it's worth the experience. Atmosphere was okay, a lot of mature people and extremely dark... I could barely see the menu so I had to take out my flashlight on my phone.  Ordered the Daiquiri Adaptation which was very strong but had a nice, sweet, edible treat. I also ordered the Sailor's Mojito which was also pretty potent. Love love love the presentation!   Service was okay. My friend and I went on a Thursday night around 9-10 and it wasn't too packed.   Would come back here just to try more of their drinks. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique bar in Toronto and is willing to spend $25-$45 on a drink."}
{"text":"Hmmm...let me tell you about barchef...  Drinks with tapas for the full effect of the flavors? Winning.  Loved.  You just have to go."}
{"text":"Yes, the drink are expensive BUT the experience is worth it! As soon as you walk into the place it has a unique sweet aroma, like incenses but not quiet. Each of us ordered a different $25 drink to try the various types.  The Mad Man was served in a very cool pipe shaped glass, the drink was strong but smooth. It was accompanied by a leather aroma smoke which was please to the senses and cubes of jelly as chasers. I enjoyed this drink thoroughly because it was completely new to me.  The Mojito is a safe choice for people who want to simply enjoy a drink and the order the first recognizable drink on the menu. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't special either. This drink also came along with a aromatic smoke diffuser.   The best tasting drink was the daiquiri, served in a real coconut on a bed of sand with cute umbrellas. The cool factor of this drink was that it was served with frozen alcohol pellets on the side, similar to those dotted ice creams you would at the movies."}
{"text":"Easy to drop some serious dough here. They have a cocktail for $45. They char vanilla wood chips first and put the drink on a bed of it and cap it with some glass dome to get an aromatic effect. They do a lot of that here. The rest of the drinks are a bit more reasonable at between $10-20 or so.  I had 2 drinks here:  the madman: this drink is interesting but ultimately not spectacular. I forget the exact composition but it involved the use of some cinnamon infused liquid, a blow torch and some dry ice (you know on second thought, just about every drink here involves a blow torch and dry ice)  forget the name of the second drink but it was some play on a gin and tonic. It had cucumber bitters in it (all bitters prepared on site) and was very refreshing, if a little too anemic on the gin. A better and more affordable drink than my first.  My friend's drinks were a cut above mine. I tried them too. The first was some grapefruit based drink they lit on fire and concocted in front of him. A really complex flavour combination and very tasty. His second drink was also good, but i forget which one it was now.  This is not a place I would go regularly. It's too expensive and not my scene really. But it gives you loads of great ideas for your own mixology experiments. A good place to try once for the novelty."}
{"text":"Went fairly late on a Tuesday, so the place was close to empty.  Would be an incredible chill date spot during the week, though--everyone else there was a couple and seemed to be having a great time.  The bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable--can't recommend them enough.  I'll dissent from the crowd and admit that I actually didn't love the Manhattan.  Don't get me wrong, it's kind of amazing to see the drink brought out under glass, and it's interesting, but there was too much vanilla for me, so the whole thing tasted sweeter than I would have liked.  (That said, I don't in any way regret ordering it once.  But for the novelty more than for the actual enjoyment of drinking it.)    The reason I'm going 4 stars instead of 5 is because this strikes me as the kind of place that's frequently either conspicuously empty (Tuesday) or stupidly full (Friday & Saturday), neither of which is really my thing, and a reason it's not clear that I'll be back unless I'm on a date."}
{"text":"Not enough good words to describe this place. Let's start with the coconut martini, phenomenology. I could drink this forever, I also had the ouster shots, loved them.  But the best thing, the Manhattan. Wow wow wow. O words, expertly created to perfection, everything about it is amazing. It tastes better as you drink more if it. The melody of tastes that you experience are indescribable. I know it's pricey but you have to try it. I already miss the taste."}
{"text":"A quick review. Came here a month ago after dinner. Were recommended drinks from the Modernist Cocktails list. We had the Sailor's Mojito and the Oceanic. We really enjoyed the Sailor's Mojito but the Oceanic fell short. The Modernist Cocktails are $25-45, while the taste of these drinks are hit and miss, the presentation of them are typically impressive. Albeit a bit loud, the ambiance there was excellent for a date."}
{"text":"Updating my review so I know which drinks to order again when I return!  - Basil daiquiri: reeeally good. It's sweet and not as basil-y as I expected, but more pineapple-y. They should've named it really-sweet-pineapple-with-a-hint-of-basil daiquiri haha. Good thing I like really sweet drinks! -Scottish breeze: bf says he wouldn't order again  Also, our faves, 427 and rocket were just as good as we remembered!"}
{"text":"BarChef elevates Toronto entertainment to a new level. This is the first venue I've been to that has such a fantastic and diverse range of cocktail options. The decor was stunning, the service was excellent, and the drinks were fantastic! I highly recommend BarChef for those who appreciate the complexities of well-balanced cocktails."}
{"text":"The minute I walked in, I got the feeling of a vampire bar, like that of From Dusk Til Dawn, but not Mexican infused like the movie.  Everything was dark, black, dimly lit, giving it an extravagant vibe.  It was pretty busy, with what looked like well- to- doers from the city who don't mind spending $12 on an Old Fashioned.    We settled in to two open spots at the bar and of course got some weird glasses and water carafe to match the vibe.  The bartender who served us didn't seem too intelligent in terms of how to interact with people nor how to ensure patrons are well taken care of, because we weren't.  It took forever just to get a drink.  Literally requested to cancel our order but it came out within the next minute or two... from the kitchen.  It was some over- the- top drink that had dry ice in a volcano dish or something... A+ presentation but all we wanted was a mojito, not a diorama on the prehistoric era of dinosaurs.  Side note, don't order a Moscow Mule here either; all it is is sour mix or lemonade mix, no ginger beer.    Needless to say, we had a drink and bounced.  Not my scene, not my flavor, not my paygrade.  I'm sure the over trendy peeps love it and rave about it but it was not a place I'd recommend or go back to when visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Really nice lounge ambiance.  Drinks were ok. If you want spectacular drinks, you have to order in \" The Modernist \" cocktail pages. 30-45$ a drink.  My friend had the \" aviation gin \" with soda which we all tried and didn't like. We told the waitress and she said she would ask her manager for another gin. The manager came and chatted with us. We tought we would get the next drink for free but he charged us, saying that my friend drank the whole glass. I explained that he only drank it since he was too shy to say anything so I said something. Anyways, in the end, he didn't charge us but I had to convince him. For an once of Tanqueray gin, as a customer, we shouldn't have to argue. Customer satisfaction should be a priority."}
{"text":"I have NEVER seen anything like this place in my life.  Never.  It was a recommendation from the lovely fellas at Suite 114.  The cocktails there defy descriptions.  My group all got different cocktails and it was a show, everything was interesting and delicious.  The atmosphere was lovely and relaxing.  I wish you existed in Washington DC.  If I find myself in Toronto again I will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"Perfect place for drinks after work while enjoying almost other worldedly cocktail experience.   Our waitress check whether it's our first time at the bar and took the time to explain different sections of the menu.  The price point may be high compared to regular cocktail as some came slat $30 or $25. But it's worth every cent that I paid.   The daiquiri is my favourite, because it came with alcohol coconut flavored shaved ice with toasted coconut and alcohol jelly and edible flower. Definitely something I've never had before and tasted better than most desserts!  The outside of the bar is very low key. All this time I walk along queen street I would have never thought to push through the curtain and check this place out. But it's full of wonderful surprises. Recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was beyond amazing! It was like walking back into the 1920s. Their cocktail were super tasty and created perfectly. The visual for each cocktail was gorgeous and special. My friends and I had a great time talking with the employees who love working there and talking about each of the cocktail my friends and I got along with their favorites. They do not take reservations so I would say get there before 7. There was no wait."}
{"text":"I mean.....yes its smug that a lot of the cocktails are $25 and one even $45, however the place was really cool inside and my $25 cocktail was pretty fun. Some sort of gin, elderflower combo with spoonfuls of truffle something. Eat a spoon and then take a sip. It worked and I'd get it again. Plus.....$25 CAD is like $20 USD so that made me feel a little better about it. Cool for a drink before dinner but it would get expensive drinking here all night."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails, particularly the mad scientist science experiment concoctions. Great atmosphere with funky eclectic mix of drinkers. Bar is rammed and staff friendly but extremely busy. Music bizarre but very well chosen mix that seems to suit everyone. Would go back for the steaming mojitos any night!"}
{"text":"On a slushy snowy night during a business trip to Toronto a colleague and I treked to Bar Chef since we heard it was one of the best bars in town,  had a great cocktail menu and lots of folks in the restaurant business went there after work.  It's a dark bar with lots of candlelight that set the stage for couples to enjoy intimate drinks and groups to sit around nice low cocktail tables and enjoy drinks and conversation.   Because it was a Tuesday night and the snow storm there weren't a lot of people in the bar and there were plenty of open tables,  If you are looking for a cheap happy hour place this isn't it.  This is upscale and drinks aren't cheap especially if you order from the molecular menu.  They do have a punch menu which would be the way to go if you are with a group.  Drinks run $14-45 each where the punches are $50 for 4-6 drinks.  I had Sailors Mojito from the molecular menu.  It was a typical molecular experience with dry ice providing a fog for the sailor and a small 'pearl' of mojito inside an alginate shell - sort of a jell-o ball shot with a liquid center.    The drink itself wasn't very well balanced - it had the sour but was missing something to balance the lime and tequila - maybe a bitter, sweet or savory herb would have done the trick.   The visual nature of the molecular drink is a bit wasted in such a dark bar as it was hard to see even with the candle next to it.  My coworker ordered a Winter juniper which had a nice herbal, earthy almost evergreen taste.  Typically I'm not a big gin fan but this was a great well done cocktail.  The service was disappointing - the waitress didn't seem enthused or interested in explaining the cocktails or making recommendations.  It felt a bit like we were a bother coming in and that she wasn't very excited to be there and certainly didn't make us excited about what we ordered.   When I didn't finish my drink she looked at it but didn't ask if I liked it when I asked to order another drink.     The next drink I tried was really good - the Basil Daiquiri.   It was very well balanced, complex and nothing like any daiquiri I've every had.  Non of the flavors dominated although the coconut made it reminiscent of a less sweet more mature version of a mai tai.  The pepper and basil really added some great background notes that made this drink clearly not something every bartender or mixologist would just mix up on a whim.  When I go back I'll be getting another one.  The place started to smell like a campfire of cedar trees that was light with vanilla extract when a guy at the bar was served his $45 Manhattan.   Event though I didn't have a drink of the manhattan  and was at least 5 meters away, it's smoky cedar vanilla flavor filled the space so much that when I got ready for bed I noticed my hair smelled a bit smoky.  The guy drinking it looked pleased but it wasn't clear if it was because of that or that he had a woman with him who was clearly really into him and the smoky drink was just the beginning of the flames that were going to burst later that evening.    Another cozy couple was drinking absinthe at the table across from us.  It came in an interesting jar where they poured it over ice and it came out spigots on each side.  At first I thought they ordered off the punch menu which would be a great thing to order with a crowd.  Bar Chef is clearly keeping up on the trends since punches are all the rage in the mixology world now.  Overall I'd recommend this place if you like to savor and appreciate great cocktails. Bar Chef fell short of 5 starts due to the service and that the molecular drink was more show than taste.  I'm intrigued by the work that goes into designing a molecular experience but am irritated when it doesn't focus enough on the flavor and taste aspect.  In this case even the visual experience was lost in the darkness so I couldn't even enjoy the dry ice fog or see the beauty of the sea foam & pearl (assuming it was cool looking since it was too dark to tell even with my iphone light) .    If you are in Toronto head to Bar Chef after dinner or for a late night drink with friends or a date."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some cocktails that are given as much care as a high end chef does to an entre, check out Bar Chef on Queen West. Each cocktail has a carefully selected ingredient list and prepared with care. I can honestly say I haven't even heard of some of the ingredients and find some even confusing.. Air? However, the end result is some fabulous tasting spins on old faithfuls and some creative new concoctions.  It is pretty pricey for a long stay, but definitely worthwhile for popping by for a couple drinks after dinner or before heading out.  Thursday seems to be absinthe night at Bar Chef, clients are treated to a specials menu where they can have the old world spirit prepared in a variety of styles."}
{"text":"3.75/5 stars. Gf and I went on a busy weekend so there was a bit of a wait. Hostess kindly added us to the list and gave us a call in 30 minutes while we wondered Queen st.  Dimmed light atmosphere and modern decor. Definately a speciality bar for their dry ice experience which puts all 5 senses into a drink. Worth a try but around  $25-35 for a drink.  The most disappointing part was that my old fashioned drink was averaged. For the price, I expected the bar tender to smoke the drink with wood chips but that didn't happen.  Absinthe was also very neat. Slow drop ice cold water over a sugar cube into a shot glass of absinthe.   Bill came to $100 or so for 2 people."}
{"text":"Drinks are life but when you drink often, it is really hard to find a bar or pub that stands out, one that you want to go to for celebration, or a special occassion, or just because you love it so much.  Everything about bar chef is what I want from a late evening hangout. The environment is calm, and dim. There is something exotic about this place that I can't put my fingers on. It's not a bar to pick up girls, or to order a huge plate of nachos to share with 5 other people. It's a perfect place to catch up or go for a romantic date.  They have a huge list of drinks, many to choose from. The price is high, but you pay for not only the drink, but also the presentation. Each drink has a theme, and the server will introduce it and present it to you before you enjoy the art! Service is friendly and welcoming.  It is not located at the best and safest part of downtown, so be safe and go with someone you know at night!"}
{"text":"Feast your sensory overload at one of our favourite delicious date night escapes. This is where the gods must go to celebrate, anything you order will be a home run and its the only spot where its almost more exciting to sit at the bar and watch all the alchemy happen first hand. Added stealth bonus mix is the in town celebrity guests, we were lucky to raise a glass to 'Hannibal's' charmers Mad Mikkelsen and Hugh Dancy. Our golden greats are the 'Vanilla and Hickory Smoked Manhatten' that is delivered on burning ambers in a bell vintage glass jar and is worth the marinate minutes of anticipation, as well as the 'Sailor's Mojito' anything that promises beach essence is a win for me. Bliss is this!"}
{"text":"My dinner date and I stopped by for a quick cocktail before dinner on a Friday night.  The service was very friendly and informative.  We opted for some of the fancier \"molecular mixology\" designed drinks, both of which were $25.  I know this seems steep for a drink, but these aren't your mothers cocktails.  Each drink appeals to the taste buds as well as the eyes, many having dry ice and smoke components and unexpected molecularly (is that a word? Don't care) altered tastiness.  I ordered the Black Truffle which came with 5 loving spoonfulls of what can only be described as a cloud and a generous portion of truffle.  One is supposed to take one of these spoons and chase it with a sip of an accompanying cocktail which blends beautifully.   My date had The Tea Service which was served in a pretty tea cup and was poured for her at our seat by the server.  It bubbled happily as he poured and was made even more complex by the elderflower ice cubes he added for her.    We were also surprised by a third bit of tastiness on the house.  I feel as though I won't do it justice by describing it, I'll just say that you take it like you would an oyster and it tasked like the best mojito you've ever had.   For those not excited by $25 cocktails, there are some available in the low teens.  I've had those bad boys before and can say they too are definitely worth it.   Go here."}
{"text":"I went here after one of my elite Toronto friends recommended it as his \"everyday drinking bar\"... Ya maybe for the king of Spain!  But honestly, drinks are expensive, and they have every right to be.  Amazing flavours, creative mixology, strong drinks, excellent atmosphere!  Try to order the drink with the dry ice and jellies.  I don't know if its still around!"}
{"text":"Ok the complete truth on this. Gastronomy bar that is very different but very expensive.   Atmosphere - kinda sucks If you sit at the bar, it's way more enjoyable. Wait time - terribly terribly long - but thats just what you get when you walk into a gastronomy bar. Let's get serious.  Now for the good stuff - if you're ready to spend some good money ($300 will get you in a good place, and $150 bux should get you tipsy) then you'll be impressed. It's all about trying different things here. Franky Solaris does a good job with creativity and uniquness here, but then again ,he's the only one doing this in Toronto.  My most memorable drink has been a $45 manhattan, which literrally tasted like being in boy scouts. Some ppl would say this is over rated and over priced, but for me it was the experience of it.  What i recommend: Go here before going out for a special fancy dinner. It will get you in the right mood and take only cash to make sure you don't end up spending more than you might want to. Have one drink and ask your friends if you can try theirs. Then maybe have a twisted arm and take a second one but promise that will be it. Then leave to dinner. Then go back there another time with a friend who would appreciate this and when you get your first paycheck of the month. Have no reservations about money and then you will have a good time.   oh and don't go on the weekend."}
{"text":"Very interesting place for cocktails. The cocktails are more of a work of art, and at a price of $25-$35, they match. They are beautiful and surprising, and you're there more for the experience rather than the taste. You don't get to keep any of the things they bring. I believe I got the \"Spring\" cocktail, and it came with dry ice and a bouquet of flowers that they took back after 20 minutes or so. It was definitely an event, but a little empty over all. The menu is sparse. It would be nice if they included dollar oysters to their menu."}
{"text":"What can I say? Amazing, unpretentious, meticulous. I can't say enough good things about this place. The modern cocktails are well worth the cost, the presentation is an experience unto itself. The bartenders clearly love what they do and want patrons to enjoy themselves. At no other place would I expect to order a $30 drink and have the bartender make sure I'm into the flavor profile and then advise against it. They really care about whether you'll enjoy your drinks.   I had the mojito which I thoroughly enjoyed. Bartenders really take the time to describe each cocktail in enthusiastic detail. Great for a special night out. Check it out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is the CHICEST and SEXIEST cocktail bar in Toronto! Now that I got your attention lol... This IS the perfect place to wow your friends on a molecular gastronomical drinking adventure :D   The cocktails are unique and absolutely delicious! If you are planning to splurge a little... treat yourself to a molecular cocktail on their Modernist menu. From your taste buds to visual presentation... it triggers all your senses! BarChef has certainly got it down to a fine art.  Black Truffle ($25) is one of my fave. It uses elderflower liquor (sweet but strong!) and it is perfectly paired with 5 spoonfuls of black truffle goodness. This one is heavenly if you're into truffles! I wouldn't share it if I were you... $5 per bite lol.  Vanilla and Hickory Smoked Manhattan ($45) is a must try (...at least once!). It looks spectacular, and it tastes sweet and smooth! Vanilla and cherry liquors go so well together. The smoked Hickory is very aromatic... reminds me of roasting marshmallow on an open campfire!  Funny thing - I don't know why I always crave for BarChef in the middle of the coldddd winter lol. Since you can't make a reservation, waiting for a table out in the freezing cold is a bxtch and I still end up doing it after all these years lmao. Hostess is not very nice about it when 20 ppl try to cram inside their tiny waiting area lol.  But seriously, BarChef is fantastic! I'm so amazed by their creativity and imagination. Definitely will revisit again :)"}
{"text":"Each cocktail is an experience, from the presentation to the last sip. It's a must bar if you are visiting Toronto and definitely a place to bring a date. Creative recipes, highly recommend #blacktruffle #aviationalegiate #sailormojito #madman"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come to barchef for months!!! The interior almost reminds me of a speakeasy. This is an awesome spot for two or three people. Large groups will get seated at the couches by the doorway. I would suggest sitting at the bar to chat with the bartendars. They really go through the menu in detail and you get to watch them do their magic! The menu is split into three sections. Would recommend trying something from their modern drink list. These are barchef's OG drinks and come with the whole theatrical performance. I tried the Pastels of Violette. The drink was steaming as it arrived!! Although a little too sweet and creamy for my taste. We also tried the Vanilla and Hickory Smoked Manhattan. This is their iconic drink. Quite the splurge too ($45 + tips and taxes). The bartender crafted an iceball carefully and placed it inside the Manhattan. The drink arrived on a display while being fused with hickory smoke. 5-10mins later, the drink was revealed. You can taste the smoke within the spice. I've never tasted anything like it before. It was incredible. Side note - really enjoy the music that night, lots of feel good throwbacks and jazzy songs."}
{"text":"I have wanted to check this out for some time and finally got the opportunity in the form of a Harry Potter-themed scavenger hunt for a bachelorette. So pretty random.   The staff here was absolutely wonderful. They were super helpful in explaining the menu and warning us about drinks that may have flavours we may not enjoy. They took our scavenger hunt photo and were very friendly. The bartenders and waitresses are also very nicely dressed.   They even provided us with a sample of one of their modern fusions. So we had one of the apricot steam fusions and one of those spoonfuls of bubbled alcohol (this is not an apt description, it tastes and smells better than I'm describing it). My group also all grabbed a different drink and every single one of them was absolutely marvellous.   I cannot think of a single criticism. I will say we went there while it wasn't very busy, so perhaps it's not as great in the late evening. But the atmosphere, drinks, and service definitely were worthy of the price."}
{"text":"This is a great date spot to end or start your night - It's not too loud and the atmosphere is great. The drinks are pretty expensive though (the cheapest being 13 and the most expensive being 40+) but they were pretty great. They're not your average drink, so it was hard to let the price bother you once you tried one.  I gave it 4 stars because when you go and its busy, they'll take your name and say they \"aim for 15 minutes\". No. It's about 30+, which is okay because there's tons of places you can go around it, but honesty is always best. They also don't have a phone service for the people waiting, so you have to just stand around either inside or outside and wait."}
{"text":"I've read tons of reviews about this place and have had many people recommend it to me. The drinks were beyond anything I could've imagined - it's great to go with a big group as the large, fancy drinks are about $30 and enough to share. Although somewhat pricey, you're paying for the aesthetic of the drinks. The service was fantastic, however I was a bit upset (though I didn't mention it at the time) because my server had spilled an entire tray of drinks and some of it got on my shoes. I did not receive any sort of discount but I still had a fantastic time!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails- the coconut mojito is so yummy, not too sweet. Atmosphere is cool kinda speakeasy-esque but service was irritating! Our waitress spent most the night chatting w friends/other staff, couldn't get her attention for the bill, repeatedly had to try calling her over to close our tab."}
{"text":"Bar Chef is such a treat! We went to celebrate a friends birthday and had a great time. It's worth ordering their specialty cocktails just for the presentation alone! The basic cocktails are around $15 but the more elaborate ones cost ~$30. Perfect place for special occasions. Look forward to trying their other cocktails!"}
{"text":"Creative and cutting edge cocktails.  They are taking the art of the cocktail it a new and exciting place.  Still keeping the old school traditions- just adding new twists."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing! Wonderful setting for evening cocktails for a date, group outing, or fancy hang out. The ambiance in this lounge / cocktail bar is upscale, classy. Pack a few dollars because this place isn't cheap. Cocktails range from 15-60 dollars, but I would say they are made with such passion and they have a majestic feel. I highly recommend the coconut mojito, probably one of the best drinks on the menu. A delicious blend of coconut, lime, and mint! The rocket drink tastes like candy and brings back that old skool feel of candy/jolly ranchers, delicious. Got an appetite? No problem, cheese platters are available, $40, but very filling. Try the sliders, made with organic ingredients, but they are extremely small, however pack a huge taste, and are worth a try. After a few drinks, some apps, decided to grab another drink: the Daiquiri Adaptation, this is one of the best desert drinks on the menu. Get ready for this. It comes in a coconut, and its placed in a sandbox with seashells and sand, and comes with a side bowl of coconut/lime sorbet with chunks of pineapples...just an amazing experience. This place has the best cocktails in town, and one of the best environments. Servers are very helpful and work like a nest of worker bees, helping each other out, just helpful in all regards. Best service, wish more places were like this. $$$$ 5/5"}
{"text":"Love this place. The bar tenders and servers seem to really take pride in their drinks. Try something new when you come here, something you wouldn't normally do. I really recommend the 'Black Truffle'."}
{"text":"Awesome drinks! Quite pricey for the molecular ones but they're quite exciting. The vanilla smoked manhattan ($45) was awesome!! They burn hickory chips and they cover the drink and let it infuse with smoke. My hair and hands smelled like campfire afterwords so if you don't like that smell, not for you. I on the other hand absolutely LOVE that smell so it made me fall in love instantly. Symphony #5 ($13) was a bit strong and I definitely wouldn't order that one unless you like the taste of pure gin!! The drink with muddled sage and grapefruit ($13) was awesome!  The atmosphere was gorgeous. The food was pretty good! No disappointments (except that it took 15 minutes to say they were out of what we ordered....) Sliders, baked brie... Quite delicious. Nothing super spectacular but a good complement to the tasty cocktails.  Service was friendly, patient and attentive. Not much passion when it comes to talking about the drinks but the menus are really well done and were quite self-explanatory. Prices range from $12 or $13 for the first few pages of cocktails, to the molecular ones ranging from something like $25 to $50.  They don't open the larger dining area until past 10 so if you come at an odd time there may be limited options for seating.  Overall, it's a great atmosphere with great drinks and I can't wait to go back! It's really great to see a place in Toronto focus this much on the art of drink mixing. Most places have boring cocktails that taste mediocre but this place was great. Definitely try it out if you appreciate fancy (but pricey) cocktails."}
{"text":"Hands down BarChef is one of the best cocktail lounges I have ever been to.   One of my last nights in Toronto I went on a mini bar hop down Queen St. W with a girlfriend of mine and BarChef was one of our stops. Yes, it was a wee bit expensive. But, it was SO worth it.   We walked in and immediately I noticed the large curtains you enter through, candlelit ambiance, and overall dark, romantic atmosphere. We sat ourselves at the bar and took a look at the cocktail menu. Our bartender, Mateo was so wonderful! He walked us through the many types of cocktails that they served. We settled on the modernist cocktails, ranging in price from $20-$30 in price. I got myself the Pastel Violette (Unsure if that's what it was actually called, but along those lines). Basically, it was the alcoholic version of a london fog. Damn, it was amazing. It was beautifully presented, well crafted, and so, so, so delicious. It even had edible flowers and everything. Mateo mixed my drink right in front of me and by pouring the two mixtures together, it created a beautiful smoky effect. Check out the attached video.   I have to give credit where credit is due. BarChef, you sure know what you're doing. The service was impeccable, the drinks were unbelievable and from what I could tell by the food menu, they've got some tasty options on there as well.  Date night, girls night out, just looking for a damn good drink? Come to BarChef."}
{"text":"Oh how to begin......What an utter disappointment.!  We went to Barchef as seasoned patrons of Toronto's cocktail scene.  After being told to leave the bar and go elsewhere while placed on the callback list (they don't allow standing- yes, you read that right), we were finally saved from enduring the kool-aid saketinis at the sushi shop next door, when the cell rang.  We were quickly ushered in and to our table as I noticed the median age of the clientele were early 20 somethings with nary an idea of what a classic cocktail would be... But I'm generalizing, aren't I.  Ok then, let's give this place a chance.  After waiting a cool 10 minutes for someone to hit our table, an extremely young (and rehearsed) waitress insists we purchase $35 'Modernist' cocktails as to truly appreciate the experience of the bar.  What an embarrassing joke of a creation- udon noodle bourbon soup with patchouli spheres? WTF? A glass slipper with smoke- dusted, sugared down bourbon with what seemed like Turkish delight squares and a smoking vat, of, well smoke- simply for effect?  Is this an adventure in mixology or an episode of Drink-Boss?  Okay, Okay, so we didn't like the modernists and we felt stupid for agreeing to this travesty of alcohol wastage, but why judge so quickly?   Well then how about the sazerac which tasted like pancake topping, the Manhattan that had no bite, the mohito served with bubble bath foam on top.... Oy, it just got worse and worse.  My personal biggest issue was the lack of knowledge from the clearly overmatched wait staff who completely could not read a customer properly or even offer suggestions..... What do you recommend for an Irish whisky fan that offers a twist, then strong armed into another 'Modernist'- lord.   But the icing on the cake was the sour faced blonde 'Manager' delivering a tray of over $100 in drinks and asking my friend to put his tiny bag of skittles away using the most bourgeois, nonchalant conjecture.  \"We don't allow outside food\" So f'n rude! Over $200 later, and it's not like he had a bag of Taco Bell on the table- it was a little bag of skittles used as an after meal mint .... I could go on, but I figure I should mention that I gave Barchef 2 stars because the decor is stunning, dark, brooding and inviting. Too bad the most important entity was a complete let down.  Barchef is enjoying the success brought on by a relentless overspending Gen Z who want to play Mad Men, but are clueless. This may work for the clearly schooled owner-duo, but how happy could they possibly be, not honing their craft and attracting the real mixology fans- established, with fatter wallets and authentic demands?  Do yourself a favor, don't go."}
{"text":"a place that prides itself on its ability to make drinks should be able to make a good, straight up manhattan. and barchef failed on that front. my manhattan had far too much bitters in it -- it was really surprising.  my friends' drinks were ok, but, in my opinion, too sickly sweet.   in a way, the drinks seemed to cater to the modern credo of just making it a little sweeter, and your clientele will smile.  the reason i'm giving the place 3 stars is because the woody smokiness in the air was quite nice, and the atmosphere was really appealing. go here and get a very simple drink that they can't mess up, and relax."}
{"text":"My sister has been talking about taking us to Barchef for a couple of years now. Finally our 4 schedules lined up and we made a date.  We walked in at around 9:00 p.m. were thrilled to get a table (with comfy chairs) immediately. We were glad we arrived when we did as we noticed people who came after us were asked to wait.  The interior was dark and mysterious with candlelit tables and lots of people sitting at the bar. On our next visit (and there WILL be one) we'll sit at the bar as that's where you can actually watch the magic happening.  We were greeted right away and handed menus. We had to use our phones to actually read the menus because it was so dark, but that was fine with us.   We opted for 4 of the 'Modernist Cocktails' first as those are the fancy ones with all the special effects. I got the Black Truffle and all I can say is WOW!!!!!!! It was out of this world. I kinda wondered what a $25 cocktail might look like and I was not disappointed in the least. I was given a glass with a gin, elderflower and coconut mixture and it tasted divine. The waiter told me to take a sip and then eat the contents of one of my 5 tasting spoons. They looked amazing with a black truffle snow, smoked Maldon salt and a coconut foam. What a taste sensation! I would definitely order this again.  My husband got the Mad Men cocktail ($25) and it was served in a glass that looked sort of like a fancy bong as it had a thin glass straw attached to it. It was served with some little jellies on the side. They had a flavour of tobacco and cherry and were really interesting to pair with the drink which had bourbon, vermouth and maple.  My brother-in-law had the Essence of Fall ($25). This was an amazing sight to behold. It looked like a little forest was being delivered to the table. There was dry ice wafting all over the place and quite the spectacle.  The drink was made from brandy, sweet vermouth, balsam  fir bitter and rosemary syrup. There was a huge sphere of maple ice in the middle of the drink. He really enjoyed it too, but wasn't inclined to finish the maple ice.  My sister ordered the Oceanic ($30). It was so cool to look at. There was a glass bowl on the bottom with 'sand' in it, made from violet foam and grapefruit essence. Then there was a Curacao gel and fresh tarragon to represent seaweed. Perched on top was a bowl made from ice which has white chocolate and cedar. It was pure white with blue and green etchings on it. It looked like china! In the bowl were a couple of rolled up jellies made from Curacao and elderflower cream and also an elderflower foam. On the side was a jug of warm white chocolate 'washed' water with coconut rum and lavender infused maraschino liqueur. When the waitress poured the jugful of liquid into the bowl, it was magnificent. The bowl broke and fell into the glass bowl and there was mist all over the place. Everything was stirred together to make the whole thing taste like the ocean.   We decided to have regular cocktails next. They're not as spectacular, but still really delicious. Each of the ones we ordered was $15. My sister had the Four Seven Two, which is purported to be bourbon and coke meets mojito meets mint julep. It had Bourbon, cola bitters, fresh lime, muddled mint and mint syrup. It was pretty good, but a pretty sour. I wouldn't order unless you're a big fan of sour drinks.  My brother-in-law had the Backwoods Boulevardier. It had Backwoods infused bourbon,  sweet vermouth, Campari and flamed atomized essence of tobacco. He liked it, but thought it was a bit bitter. I, however, loved it! If you're a fan of bitters, this is a good one to order.  My husband had the Dark Necessities. It had Bourbon, violette liqueur, caraway infused maraschino, rosemary syrup, sweet vermouth, and cacao bitters. It was good, but was just a little too overwhelmingly 'herby'.   I had the Scottish Breeze. I LOVED it!!! It had Orange infused scotch, mint, raisin bitters, honey and black pepper syrup, soda and atomized Islay. It was just the perfect mixture of sweet, bitter and delicious scotch flavour. I would have it again for sure.  We could've stayed there all night, just trying more and more cocktails but just 2 drinks each ended up costing almost $250 with tip so I'd say this is more of a special occasion place where you only order a drink or two.   We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of Toronto's finest cocktail bars. They are known for their special variations of cocktails. They are quite strong, flavourful, bold and unique. If you would like to come and enjoy and unique beverage and share a romantic date, a friendly catch-up or a small group gathering, I would highly recommend Bar Chef. The bartenders in the back present these cocktails in an artistic manner full of essence and personality.   I personally ordered the essence of fall. It was presented with dry ice, in a rounded cup with little plants around it. There is an ice ball in the cup that as it melts, the alcohol flavour is enhanced and it actually becomes a little bit more sweeter and bolder. I highly recommend this if you want the full bar chef experience. It was a little bit strong for my taste, but I did enjoy it quite a bit.  My friend ordered the sailor moon mojito and it was amazing as well! It was gearing towards the more sweeter taste palette. If you'd like a sweeter drink but strong, choose this one!   Service was great, environment was pleasant and unique and selection of drinks were numerous! Come and try bar chef :)"}
{"text":"Overpriced, overhyped, but decent. Expected stronger drinks for the price. It's something to check out once."}
{"text":"Been here several times with my girlfriends and we always have a great night. Stepping into Barchef is like entering the world of great gatsby. It is pricey but a lot of care  and production is placed into the creation of all the drinks here! They have a pretty good wine selection as well."}
{"text":"BarChef is and exciting and surprising place to stop for a drink.  From the selection of modernist cocktails, we ordered the Spring Thaw and Black Truffle. I really enjoyed the frozen shavings of lime, coconut, and truffle that accompanied the liquor. It was a delight balancing the cold bites with the sweet alcohol. The Spring Thaw was served in a bouquet and liquid nitrogen was used to water the floral elements that imparted a subtle yet refreshing fragrance to the cocktail.  The only thing is that it is a bit dark inside, so it was difficult to appreciate the creations. Nevertheless, all cocktails appeared beautiful and different from each other. They run approximately $30 each, but with the strong USD, you can think of them as discounted ;)"}
{"text":"OK ... to sum it up ... this is my absolute preference for style and neighbourhood of a lounge bar.  Funky ass, wear what you wearin', graffiti'd up, cool Queen west --- MEETS --- stylish, clean, designer, boutique, exotic, a cut above the rest ambiance. Now apart from the decor ... this place is all about the actual drink menu.  I can't do it justice, or quite frankly remember at this point ... but there were certainly 2 different kinds of absynthe.  A special one for my friend who needed to eventually go home to his wife, and educated Aussie staff provided the green coloured less pungent-stink-o-licorice-what-the-hell-were-u-drinking variety, vs my cloudy stiff as nails smelly ass version.  Both equally as impressive with ice cold water in a large lemonade stand like bong contraption slowly pouring cold water over a melting cube of sugar on a holey spoon atop this mix.   I can only describe this so well because I can accurately recall the ingredients, whereas the more intricate cocktails (\"signature\" whatever it was called crown royal based one was $45 ... even being my birthday not feeling down with the crown).  Ah haaah, I do recall one of them having pomegranite seeds, like 2\" thick at bottom of the glass.  I did a lil swirl like action in the oddly chosen champagne glass to serve that one in.  It's all coming back to me now.   There was a raspberry vodka with all kinds of mint and lime ... yummy.  In the $11 or $13 range. Concoctions of all sorts.  Pick your poison is the name of this game. Now - on Thursday-Saturday nights, beyond 10, it does get busy ... but I would typically enjoy this place on an off night, grab a big cooshy loungey couch and table to yourselves, and sip away. Nibbled on some apps and food.  The menu was sparce, but better than decent.  Pizza was great.  Thin crust and cut for ya.  Calamari was flavourful and not stringy or cheap-ass.   I like it."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to go here. It finally happened one day on the spur of the moment. The hostess was friendly and accommodating and the place had an upscale, decent ambience.  The drinks were disappointing even though I chose 2 of the $25 ones.  I did enjoy the company of the couple sitting next to me and here's one off my bucket list, so that's good."}
{"text":"My friend and I checked out BarChef on a whim, hoping to have a few drinks before finding someplace in the area to have dinner. The whole BarChef experience is one you have to have foe yourself. The cocktails were amazing, albeit a bit pretentious. Expensive but worth the experience once. I probably wouldn't go back, but I'm happy we experienced it and would recommend to anyone looking for a unique bar experience."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Bar has a unique fancy atmosphere (dark, candles), the staff was friendly and enthusiastic. We tried 3 of their molecular cocktails, a mix of cocktail and an edible component. The experience was worth the $25-30. Mine (Night Blossom) tasted like a soft cloud of whisky and patchouli, served in a bowl with chopsticks. Take a look at the gallery to see what their creations look like. Would have loved to try all their drinks."}
{"text":"I came for the amazing cocktails.....   and still managed to be impressed.   Impressive flavour and texture; unique presentation....   plus great conversation with some of the most talented bartenders around.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Wow! I made a huge deal of visiting this place during my work conference. Even made my coworkers wait a half hour after midnight, after driving 11 hours from D.C.  WORTH IT. We put our name on the list, and their staff called twice just to give us updates on when our table would be ready. Customer service at its finest in the TO! My colleague and I both ordered a modernist cocktail, you know, the ones with the entire show. She ordered the one in the shrubbery with the aromas (spring ___?), and I ordered the black truffle. When mine arrived, I was a little less than impressed. (Perhaps wanting a whole circus show with my drink) But, just one sip of my drink and the complimenting teaspoon of heaven that came with it, was everything this entire place was hyped up to be. My colleagues drink presentation was amazing... but so was the cocktail! Thank you BarChef for giving us a taste of what you have to offer. I'll definitely be back next time!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We had to wait about 20-30 minutes to geta  table but the wait was worth it. the drinks are creative and imaginative and delicious!! I enjoyed the lavendar cocktail while my husband indulged in some other drink i cant remember.  my favorite thing here was the ambiance. they had the most perfect dark environment ...super sexy sultry and perfect for a date!   the table beside us ordered that crazy expensive concotion which was very theatrical coming out but given the amount you get... i didnt htink itd be worth the price tag. maybe some other time.  will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Trendy atmosphere, but extremely loud and dark. It's difficult to converse with the person beside/across from you and all your clothes will smell after coming here. Seems a bit outrageous to be paying $40 for a drink \"experience\", the emphasis being on the experience as taste is secondary. The presentation is actually quite impressive, but more of a novelty thing. You can go for the \"cheaper\" cocktail menu (~$15), but then again, I could also go anywhere else for that."}
{"text":"Get ready for an experience unlike anything else in Toronto, or anywhere for that matter. barchef is the new creation of co-owners Frankie and Brent (both ex-Kultura) and a standout in the boring old bar genre.   Frankie is no bartender, he's a true mixologist, award winning, and with a passion for creating cocktails unlike any you could ever dream up yourself. Brent is a sommalier, an exceptional food and wine guy. The two of them bring their skill sets together at barchef in a cozy bar/lounge setting.  barchef offers seating at tables where you can enjoy great appetizers and small plates from an interesting menu along with your cocktails, but what barchef is really about is the barchef himself - Frankie. Try to come at a time when it's not so busy, sit at the bar in front of the elaborate ingredient set up, chat with Frankie, and see what goes into each drink he makes - you'll be amazed, and that's even before you taste them. I mean where else can your drink ingredients blowtorched, muddled, caramelized, mashed or smoked (yes - entire drink smoked in a glass chamber with smouldering hickory wood chips) right in front of your eyes behind the bar.   There is nothing ordinary at barchef; no boxed/canned juices, salt rims, or ice cubes, but rather fresh fruit to juice/muddle, fresh herbs/spices, homemade custom rims to match the drink, a giant block of ice to chip from, foams, airs, raviolis, and the list goes on...  Now, one warning - barchef is not your corner bar. Given the amount of care and time that goes into each drink expect to wait a few minutes to get it, and expect to pay for the experience. That said, at around $10-$15 for most cocktails the prices are reasonable for what you get.  My favourite - the Lemon Ginger mash, a drink that won Frankie a competition a few years back."}
{"text":"When my friends and I were searching for the place, we definitely missed it like two or three times. Upon finding it, I must say, this is definitely one of Toronto's hidden gems.  When you walk in, the atmosphere in the room is absolutely breathtaking. The room is nicely decorated, dimly lit, with small groups sharing tables here and there. Definitely the kind of place for a more intimate night with that special person or a small group of friends you want to catch up with on a real level.  Service was great. Took a little while to get the drinks until I realized why it's called Barchef. They really do specialize in unique drinks not served anywhere else in Toronto. Drinking there really made you appreciate all the little details these bartenders put into making a drink. Definitely NOT your typical bar that dumps drinks in a glass and says \"Hey tip me\". They really work for it.  Only downside is that it's pricey. If I had the money though, I would definitely come here more often."}
{"text":"After my visit to the Barchef, I realized my search for the best cocktail lounge in Toronto is over !  No,  I didn't try one of those fancy molecular drinks.  I just have one of those basic cocktails which cost $13 and even at the first sip  and I knew! One might argue that it is pricey, but when you realized all those unique ingredients that they used to make your drink were prepared and infused in house, the receipe for  the exact portion to make a balanced and polished drinks,  it really does worth that price tag.   Though the loungers looked comfortably inviting,  sit at the bar!  Talk to the bartender,  watch he prepares all the drinks,  that alone is an experience!  My Yelp Drinking Buddy would have ordered more drinks and food if not for our dinner reservations  at 8 PM. I just love my Strawberry and Lavender Cocktail ($13) which was so delicious, I licked every single lavender infused sugar off the rim of my martini glass.  And it was also the rare occasion that I fought and made sure I had my share of the Sliders($13). Hey, get your hands off my half of the slider!  Don't even think about it!   I definitely will be back again and again to Barchef for some of their cocktails and a pre dinner snack!"}
{"text":"The drinks were quite a show, and worth the money. For the four of us, we spent about $100 each. Due to the great drinks and good servers, I am giving the restaurant three stars instead of one.   What was TERRIBLE and ruined the creativity and awesome vibe was the service from the hostess at around 6. The restaurant was pretty much dead, because it was early, and the two of us asked for a table for four- our friends were about 5 minutes away.   What followed was pretty shocking, and probably the worst experience I've had in Toronto restaurants yet. The hostess refused to seat us until our whole party was there (okay fine ugh), but then insisted that we wait outside in the -20 C weather until our friends came because where she was standing was a fire escape and we couldn't stand there (WHAT!). I asked if she was joking, and if we could sit in one of the many many many empty tables/couches until our other two friends got there. She said no. And to add injury to insult, she said we couldn't wait in between the entry doors either where it was slightly warmer, we had to wait on Queen Street. She even suggested that we go somewhere else and come back and that \"she didn't make the rules\".  We were very close to leaving BarChef without trying it, but the whole point of the night was for us as couples to do something different for drinks.  What was slightly ridiculous after this occurrence is that as we were leaving after spending $400.00, we saw the same hostess cooly standing there with a bunch of people waiting for a table beside her and two girls sitting down on single chairs at the front. The fact that the restaurant was considerably more packed at this point and no one else was being made to wait outside in -20 C weather was laughable.   I spoke the manager as I left and she took my feedback gracefully. The co-owner even gave me one of his cards to email back when I am in next. I am struggling with going back because even now I remember how fantastic and inventive the place was, but then I am reminded about being made to wait outside in the freezing cold because of some 16 year old hostess's ego problem."}
{"text":"Best cocktail place in Toronto. We love Spring Thaw and Mad Man, they're so cool!!! Omg it's my first time to see cocktails like this"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in all of North America!! One of a kind cocktails. I really don't like Manhattans but the one here was spectacular! If you go to this bar, you have to order one of their \"Modernist cocktails.\" I tried Strawberries and Lavender, which is under Sweet&Sour cocktails, and thought it was good/cool but not super worth it. Modernist cocktails not only taste amazing, but also offer a great experience. Sailor's Mojito was also very delicious too. Black Truffle was very interesting, but I'm not sure whether I would order it again."}
{"text":"I am a pure beer guy however, this bar and it's cocktails has me coming back for more! I have tried two punch bowls and almost all of their super speciality cocktails including the smoked Manhattan. The atmosphere is elegant and upbeat. Just to warn you though... the place is a little pricey but it is worth it for that special lady."}
{"text":"I really love this bar!  The $45 Vanilla Smoked Manhattan was really that good. If it wasn't $45 I would be drinking it all night. The smoldering wood chips is not just for show, it leaves a subtle mellow smokey taste off the rim of the glass as you drink the heavenly contents inside (very smooth, slightly sweet, with various levels of flavours). It also creates a warm soothing campfire scent in the bar. I really admire the perfectly carved chunk of ice that's served with the drink -- smaller ice cubes would dilute the concoction. Instead of ordering another Manhattan I sampled at least 4 other well crafted cocktails which were also very good. Another great cocktail I had was a whiskey shaken with saffron and egg whites. The drink menu often changes, which really shows off Frankie and Brent's talented craft -- be sure to check their menu on their website for their current concoctions.  Definitely sit at the bar, eventhough the counter is crammed with bottles and various ingredients (familiar and unusual). It's fun seeing the bartenders, or shall I say mixologists, put together their concoctions with blow torches, dry ice, and spray bottles. Their cocktails are often infused with unusual ingredients such as herbs, spices and homemade bitters. Being an avid cook and cocktail afficienado it really made me want to try this kind of artistry at home or with friends.  A lot of people say this place is overrated or gimmicky, but I like the atmosphere, the service was excellent and the food and drinks were tasty. The vibe is great, very comfortable and not pretensious. There was a projection screen that was showing some vintage black & white films and the DJ which appeared later in the evening played an awesome mix of lounge, 80's and motown music. The staff were very friendly and great to talk with. The place also attracts some great customers as well. Many of us sitting at the bar were chatting with each other and having a good time.  Yes, the drinks are on the pricey side, but all were well made with care and well worth it. Other bars that charge these kind of prices are often too pretensious (in both it's atmosphere and service) and don't offer the fun experience as Barchef.  This is the place I would take friends from out of town, celebrate an occasion, treat myself to something special, or take a special date to without disappointment. Keep up the excellent work Barchef, if I was richer I would going here every week!"}
{"text":"So worth it! At least, check this place once for a fresh unique cocktail. The best spot is at the bar -  entertaining and lots of fun) Bartenders are really nice=)"}
{"text":"Name says it all...their drinks take a minute to make but they are so good and worth it.  I still tell stories of the drinks I've had here while on my travels.  Great bar!"}
{"text":"Wow.    BarChef isn't an everyday place, unless you have a better bankroll than I.  It's an impressive place to take a date / client / angry significant other, however, because you can't leave this place in a bad mood (well, except for the leaving part...I would set up residence there if I could).  BarChef has the most innovative cocktails that I've ever seen.  Their use of molecular gastronomy really sets them apart from other cocktail bars.  They're part show, part work of art.  It's not a place I'd go to tie on one, but it's a great place to start the night.    We tried two of their molecular cocktails, and I would love to go back and try the rest.  They really were impressive.  The fogs, the airs, the foams, the spoons...it's just incredibly unique and a great drinking experience.    Service here is very slow, however.  It took 20 minutes to get our first round, but they were so good it was worth it.  I recommend getting a \"normal\" drink your first round, then immediately ordering a molecular cocktail.  They take 10-20 minutes to put together, so order early and order often.    After spending 6 months in Toronto, BarChef is the only place I'll be thinking of returning to if/when I go back."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY:   Anything on the menu looks like something you wanna try, but if you want a different kind of experience, go for the modernist cocktails. It's not like something you've tried before. It's like Michelin star level drink!! I personally liked my spring thaw but you can try other ones like mad man or the manhattan which is really cool!  LAST TIP:  Sit at the bar to talk to the bartenders as they tend to your needs and explain what the drinks are. And. You get to see their mixing skills live in action! After all, you are there for the drinks right? ;)"}
{"text":"I came here last night to have drinks with my friends. The menu didn't seem extensive, but it was so hard to pick a drink as they all seemed so good!  If you're looking for something fruity, I'd suggest the basil daiquiri (and only if you like pineapple flavors). The alcohol wasn't too strong in that drink. I think if I were to go again, I'd get this one. The other fruity drink was the rocket. It tasted like raspberries and looked like the rocket popsicle (which is what its name is aimed at). There were also pomegranates at the bottom of the drink, which you could eat after.   Under the Modernist section, my friend got the Sailor's Mojito. The presentation is definitely very unique. There's the drink, then the beach essence with smoke coming out (probably from dry ice) and then the mojito ravioli. So basically, you have three things on the plate. You start by slurping down the mojito ravioli (shuck it like an oyster), then smell the smoke and then drink your drink. My friend really enjoyed it. We all enjoyed being able to share the smell from her drink. Hahaha.  I ended up opting for the pyrat. It came on a small plate as well, with a glass filled with rum and with the bitter almond ice and orgeat ice and regular ice. The bitter almond and orgeat I believe were frozen like dry ice, so when those were put into the drink, it caused it to smoke a bit. Then the waiter had used a lighter to burn the orange peel a bit, then put it in the drink. This drink will definitely test your patience! The rum is really strong until you let the ice melt completely. We used the candles on the tables and swirled the drinks occasionally to help with the melting process. My friend, being an impatient person, kept swirling her drink and ended up taking sips of it before it all melted. I started to drink it when the ice was more than half melted. I found it quite bitter and strong, but once the ice completely melted, it wasn't too bad.   Overall, I think I would come by to try the other fruity drinks. It's definitely worth it to go and just try it. Even though the drinks are pricey!"}
{"text":"A very dark, trendy bar. It also gets pretty loud so it's hard to have a conversation without yelling at each other.  The drinks are decently priced at about $14 each. Not the best quality drinks though.   I wouldn't recommend the \"full experience\" drinks that they offer for $25 and up. Very gimmicky and not worth it."}
{"text":"Okay drinks, a few quite delicious, but - as others have mentioned - less because they were brilliant \"molecular\" concoctions & more because they were stuffed with syrups. Have you ever been told by someone drinking a pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks that they're \"a real coffee lover\" & thought, \"But you're just drinking syrup?\" Same thing here. I've got nothing against trashy, sugary cocktails, & if you're honestly selling them then good luck & Godspeed - but don't try to convince me that I'm drinking artisanal masterworks.  Staff were friendly & the bartenders were nice & accommodating. Decor is truly appalling. Looks like a university student's first off-campus apartment after buying all the slightly goth accessories at IKEA. Tacky leather barstools & couches that appear to come from a hotel bar's garage sale. It's all supposed to be crisp, clean, & opulent but it's flimsy particle board & hollow. Absolutely devoid of character or charm.  If they really wanted to drive home the fact that this place is all about manufactured character - mutton dressed as lamb - then they definitely got it right with the decor. Yuck."}
{"text":"Dimly lit bar with very creative cocktails.  Read all the reviews and wanted to see for ourselves one of these cocktails works of art.  Was not disappointed. Yes 25 dollars for a cocktail is steep but I appreciate the thought put behind the drinks. The presentation is unique and 50% of the experience.  The taste was on point. My bf got the mojito, which he really enjoyed.  I got the daiquiri that came with a bowl of ice snow and different ingredients that mimic the drink.  Very fun to taste and play with as it is all presented in a small box of sand.  A little beach paradise.    Our server Ashly was sweet and helpful. Recommend a nice oyster and seafood restaurant for our last meal in Toronto.  Good place to sit back with friends or date night kinda place."}
{"text":"Honestly, the only thing worse than feeling out of place in a bar is feeling downright unwelcome. Not since being the only kid in grade school to own a pair of 10-hole Doc Martens and being sneered at by my preppy, Tretorn-wearing classmates have I felt so...unwanted.  Nevermind the clientele - I knew they'd be pretentious, better dressed, more well-read, and perhaps more educated than me - but I expected more from the staff. It's really a shame because the drinks were OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS, not to mention inventive, and I arrived with money to burn.  The server making the rounds was more interested in appeasing the visibly wealthy than little ol' me and I stood around waiting for someone to hand me a menu for at least ten minutes. I mean, I may not have been wearing a cocktail dress but I didn't look like Sol the fucking Clown either. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEkXBjTuTP4)   I gave up and took a seat at the bar instead and was greeted with even snootier service from what I actually presume to be one of the managers - or at least, his let-me-lord-over-you-with-my-extreme-and-unparalleled-mixology-knowledge attitude conveyed that. I have been to mixology bars in NYC, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, and felt welcome and intrigued by all of them. While I may not be an expert in the art of cocktails I am eager to learn more about the beverages I order and was disappointed by the attitude at Barchef.  As mentioned the drinks were outstanding and carefully crafted. I relied on several rounds of \"Van Gogh's Downfall\" ($12) which contained absinthe, orgeat, clove, orange blossom water, anise and lemon rind. I am not a fan of anise OR orgeat (an in-house syrup made of almonds, sugar and rose water) yet somehow this combination worked beautifully.   Drinks were surprisingly affordable at $8-12 each, with the lone exception being the $45 Manhattan (Crown Royal extra rare, fresh lemon, cherry vanilla bitters made in-house, hickory smoked syrup and vanilla cognac).  Shame about the attitude, really. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Focusing more on the show than the flavor, Barchef caters to the first time crowd more than regulars. Sure, you could bring new dates here and impress them all, but personally I think I'd get tired of coming here and spending $20/drink on a cocktail show.   Barchef may be a little hard to find, having only a single unlit sign on Queen Street, but upon entering you'll wonder how you missed its presence. The beats are loud and the bartenders are moving. There is a smoky smell in the air. Perhaps it's diffusing from the Hickory Smoked $45 Manhattan that is sold at Barchef, featuring  all sorts of molecular techniques.  I had the opportunity to try a few drinks, including Saffron meets Scotch ($13) (being Indian, I have a soft spot for saffron), Fire and Ice ($20), and the Savory Margarita ($20).   I was most excited for the Fire and Ice, being an absinthophile, but it was probably the most disappointing. The drink comes in 3 glasses, two of which are on fire and get poured as liquid flames into the third. It tastes more like kool-aid than absinthe. While the show was neat, it was probably the worst absinthe cocktail I've ever tasted. When I taste an absinthe cocktail, I want to be able to taste the anise and feel the kick of the high percent alcohol. Lighting the absinthe on fire doesn't do much for the cocktail.  I was also really excited for the savory margarita which included avocado foam, tomato caviar, and a coriander and tortilla chip rim. It arrived as a good sized margarita, paired with two spoons each filled with a salty avocado foam and tomato caviar. I'm not sure how one goes about creating tomato caviar but it was both intriguing and delicious when paired with the avocado foam, followed by a large sip of savory margarita, also preluded by coriander and tortilla chips. Mmm.  Probably one of the best margaritas I've had in my life.   A nice surprise was the delicious flavor of the Saffron meets Scotch. It included a mix of saffron infused brandy, and some scotch. The first few sips won't give you much of the beautiful saffron taste, but keep sipping and towards the bottom you'll get lots of that unique flavor. It's one of the better Scotch cocktails I've had, and would definitely recommend it. One critique I had with the drink is that I would have preferred that all the saffron stands would be strained out before mixing the cocktail. They don't do much for the image of the drink and certain don't feel good in your mouth when you take a sip.   Overall, Barchef was a very entertaining experience. I had not yet seen a bar that was both about the show and the mixology. Some of the recipes could use a little improvement, but I'd still recommend this bar for both Canadians who have not been, and my fellow Americans visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Called on a Saturday to get a reservation. Was told they don't take reservation unless it's for 6pm. We wanted to go at around 7:30. Walked into the restaurant at 7:30. Was asked if we had reservations.....no we didn't... Wait will be around 10 minutes. Another 7 people were also waiting. We were 2. A table of what looked like 15-20 people walks out, 3 new randoms walk in, talk to the \"manager\" and get a table immediately despite not being on any list. We ask if we can get in since about 15 people left. No. We just sat a table for 6 and another of 3.... In our mind we are thinking this is terrible (And also terrible math...) You have us waiting at the door basically, cannot even walk into the bar to get a drink, then when people leave we still don't get a table. Not worth it. Walked out and went to Spirit House instead. Great service there and we could get a drink immediately at the bar. It's Saturday night Barchef, and you're not a club... Sad to say I'll probably not be back to visit."}
{"text":"Very interesting speakeasy-type bar that clearly likes serving pricey cocktails with smoke on, in, or around it. They really do go a little bit overboard here and show up with plates of...veggies and mini-shrubs that \"heighten\" your olfactory/gustatory senses. Whatever. It's fine for a one-time visit."}
{"text":"Walking in, the scent of smoked fire-wood sets the tone. Old speakeasy vibe. Our Aussie bartender informed us that their specialty lies in their house-blended bitters. He was great, he even gifted us an order of their \"mojito wontons\" (imagine shooting an oyster, but mojito in taste...molecular genius).  Loved the \"Kensington\": Canadian Rye, Patchouli Syrup, violate liqueur, sweet vermouth, rosemary lavender bitters.  Mixology at its finest."}
{"text":"- Vodka in the form a flashing light! - Scotch in the form of hand lotion! - Bud Light in the form of cotton candy!  Now, these things don't actually exist here at BarChef, but the modernist cocktails on the menu are just as crazy, and almost quite as unbelievable. When you enter, the smell of burning wood will completely envelope you and your face, and your clothes will likely smell like hickory smoke for a fairly long time. The inside is pretty dark and intimate, and a pretty great place for dates. You have your choice of the \"normal\" cocktails and the more creative \"modernist\" cocktails, which uses many molecular gastronomy techniques, so as to stimulate the senses in a unique way.  The modernist cocktails we tried: - Black Truffle: They give you some truffle snow shooters with coconut foam, dill, and smoked salt, to be swished around in your mouth, then you take the gin, coconut, and elderflower mixture as a palate cleanser. The flavors work together, but by the end, you just end up drinking gin, coconut and elderflower liqueur.  - Mad Man: So basically the mixture of backwoods infused bourbon, cacao, cherry, sweet vermouth, maple, and black pepper is placed in a beaker with a long glass straw, while a mixture of antique leather and dry ice is placed right next to the beaker, so you smell the leather as you consume the drink. The aroma of leather is very strong, and if your clothes haven't been smelling from the burning wood, they'll definitely smell from the leather. - Hickory-smoked Manhattan: Brought out underneath a clear glass cloche, with a ton of smoke coming from some hickory wood underneath the glass. The clear, symmetrical ball of ice within the actual rocks glass takes in a lot of the hickory flavor, and the pour of crown royal special reserve is pretty generous. -Night Blossom: Probably the craziest cocktail of the night. This cocktail was meant to be consumed like ramen, with the cacao and chartreuse branches to serve as the \"noodles,\" and the maple/almond orgeat snow gets melted with the liquid portion of the cocktail or the \"broth,\" purportedly made with bourbon. They even give you a spoon and chopsticks. Outrageously unique and weird.   Service was generally attentive, friendly, and very good with recommendations. I was a fan of the music they were playing, from Cherub to Biggie Smalls. The cocktails took a considerable amount of time to come out, but it's no surprise with the techniques that they're using. The only real knock is the value, in my opinion. Yes, the price lies in the presentation and general kookiness, and the cocktails were really good, but not quite outstanding. In the end of it all, CA$45 is still incredibly pricey for a smokey Manhattan, even if it does come with some form of entertainment.   Would I come back? Probably, if I reaaaallly wanted to impress someone with my bankroll, or if you just wanted to smell like hickory smoke all night. I really do like the flavors and they seem to know what they're doing, but I'd say this is a once in a while type thing."}
{"text":"Want to impress a date?  Show you're amazing and cool, and worthy of another date? Take them here.  Dark ambiance, cool decor, perfect to have an intimate drink.  We had a bunch of Gin and Tonics, and of course got one of their fancy pants drinks for a laugh.  My only comment is drinks can take a lot of time.  I know the bartenders are crafting alchemical libations etc etc but it should take 20 min to get a Gin and Tonic, ya know?  Anyways, great place."}
{"text":"went here on a warm summer night after dinner at lisa marie. there was a bit of a line-up as it was a friday night.  the atmosphere and decor are reminiscent of a speakeasy and a throwback to the prohibition era.  (the seats were also very comfortable).  the drinks menu was very in-depth and there was a large variety of cocktails.  there were definitely some very fancy and over-the-top drinks; the presentation was beautiful - they definitely take their time in preparing your drinks.  the downside is that it is also quite pricey but you do pay for what you get."}
{"text":"I came here late one night with a friend who was very familiar with the place.  We bypassed a small lineup and entered.  This place looks like a cross between funeral parlour and an old school travelling circus.   We sat at the bar, and I was basically in awe from the time I arrived until the time I left.   This is not a bar... this is a show.  I watched the magicians behind the bar create the most amazing things... I went through the menu literally trying to make sense of it all.  It was like watching a fascinating exciting foreign movie.  We ordered the punch bowl with some waters (as we had to keep up our hydration after a night on the town).  It was DELICIOUS!   This place is expensive, if you think that you are buying drinks.  But you aren't... you are buying an experience... a show.  As out of it as I was, I will never forget what I experienced at this place.  The dry ice... the drip mechanisms, even the fancy water glasses.  The nice, strange people that I was talking to.  It's a beautiful, dark Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland kind of portal.   Simply fascinating!  And you know you have a good place when... we were waiting for a cab outside... everyone who walks out of this place is smiling ear to ear.  A+"}
