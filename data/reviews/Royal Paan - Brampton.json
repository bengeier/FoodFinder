{"text":"We tried the pao bhaji, and it was delicious:)
They also serve lots of other Indian street food items, like falooda, shakes, paan, burgers, wraps, paani puri. Great place to go for a late night bite, but not so heavy."}
{"text":"I don't know about other food menu items. I had Royal Faluda($6) which was completely a FAIL. It was wayy too sweet filled with vanilla ice-cream rather than Kulfi. I'm giving w stars just because the price included the tax in it. I might give a try to their food item later but it ruined my mood just with their Faluda."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place gets any customers besides the paan itself. The drinks are all artificial low quality syrups and watered down. The food is total rubbish quality, nothing here is fresh, nothing here is healthy."}
