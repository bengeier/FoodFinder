{"text":"I'm sorry to say the service has gone downhill at this establishment. I live in Killarney and often visit the deli for food cravings.. Today I ordered schnitzels and pierogi's to go, and was served by a short red haired woman who seemed fed up with having to put two items in a plastic bag and hand me the debit machine. She rolled her eyes and sighed more often that humanly possible. When I asked if they had sour cream for the pierogi's, she glared and said they were in the fridge (in tubs). When I said I only needed a small amount, which one of her friendlier coworkers gave me last time, she shifted and said that was only for eat-in customers. \"Well, ok.. I'll just pay for it then\". Nope, she glared and turned away before I could say anymore.  The food is average, nothing special. Schnitzels are better at Wiener Schnitzel Haus in Bowness. I usually like to support local neighbourhood spots, but will not be revisiting Heritage Deli."}
{"text":"This was my first time going in and it wasn't a great experience. There was a lady working the front who looked at us as we walked in but never greeted us at all. We felt like she resented us for coming in. She was grumpy and short with us. The sausage was super dry but honestly the perogies were very tasty and the special mustard was great.   I won't be returning mostly because the service just wasn't great at all. You don't need to go above and beyond but you can at least say hi and acknowledge your clients."}
{"text":"Indulge your inner Ukrainian at this place.  Try the sweet perogies filled with berries!"}
{"text":"Specializing in Polish fare, this shop carries everything from lunches and dinners to go, to European cheeses, homemade sausages, schnitzels, cabbage rolls and cheesecakes. Don't even GET me started on their perogies... boasting 9 different flavours (9!!!), Heritage Bakery & Deli is truly a one of a kind shop in our city.  Be sure to take full advantage of their AMAZING Christmas baked goods starting mid-November. See you in line? Yeah, thought so."}
{"text":"The three stars is for how nicely my Mom was treated when we came in here on a whim. The baked and deli goods are fresh, and the service is on point. We were also informed that you can call in and order ahead, so that you don't have to worry about making the drive there and your favorite item not being available.  But the jarred stuff I bought, namely, the black currant jam and hot horseradish spread, was old and disgusting when I opened it up. And since it would cost more in gas to drive here and return them, I just threw them out. So minus two stars for food waste. Rotate your stock once in a while, Heritage!"}
{"text":"I used to always go to this deli for my perogies but on my last 3 visits the perogies I bought were very rubbery almost like they were old, freezer burnt and just not the quality they used to be which is a huge disappointment to this Ukrainian girl. The cabbage rolls with bacon are still delicious but the perogies definitely need improvement."}
{"text":"This wonderful place has been around for years and is always benefiting the community with their great food and great prices. This is a place you go if you want bang for your buck. At this place I have tried their : - blueberry perogies - potato and cheddar perogies - sauerkraut perogies - deli slider with sauerkraut  - cabbage rolls  - kalbasa sausage   From all these options I would recommend creating a combo plater with the cabbage roll, sausage and perogie of your choice. My favourite is the potato and cheddar perogie.  I am not a fan of the blueberry perogy because I do not so much like dessert items and this perogie was too sweet for me when I prefer them to be savoury."}
{"text":"The perogies here are very very good. The sausage is also very very good. However, I wasn't a big fan of the cabbage rolls. We also purchased a cherry pie from them. It is not made at the store, but the young lady told me that they 'put them together' at the store. I'm not exactly sure what that means. The atmosphere is nice and the prices are reasonable. If you want a fast lunch that will fill you up, then go here. It's not perfect, but it's still good."}
{"text":"Do you want to know a secret? Heritage Bakery is the magical source of hand pinched perogies and a certain well known food truck. I saw it on their website, and asked in person today when I went to pick up some perogies and cabbage rolls. Unfortunately, the duck and carrot cake perogies on a certain truck's menu aren't found in Heritage's deep freeze. Sorry! You'll still have to line up for those.  Heritage Bakery is just off 17th Ave on 37th St SW. Street parking only. But a great stop for lunch, whether you want to dine-in or eat out. I got my food to go today. Two dozen perogies and five cabbage rolls. The perogies needed boiling, but those cabbage rolls came cooked. All they needed was a little reheating in the microwave. All of this ran me about $21. They only serve potato and cheddar perogies in-house (or at least that's the only kind they were serving today. I'm not sure if they change it up), but flavours to take home include: sauerkraut, meat, sauerkraut and mushrooms, potato and cheddar, potato and cottage cheese, potato and onion, cottage cheese and onion, sauerkraut and meat and some fruit filled ones too!  The store also boasts a small selection of goodies and other imported treats.   If you're buying Cheemo from the grocery store, stop. Stop right now! There's better home-made stuff to be putting in your system.  Oh, and they only take cash or debit."}
{"text":"Not the \"greatest\" for Easter European foods, but there is a vast selection. They sell out of a lot of stuff around the holidays - as I found out the hard way.   Pretty good poppy seed loaf, perogies, cabbage rolls, borscht, latkas.   I have driven this food to Vancouver and no one as ever been disappointed by the quality of the food. And it just smells damn good in there - even for a vegetarian/vegan."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of meeting Kathy and her staff members at a due called the 'Taste of Calgary' this last summer. She really knows how to sell some great Polish food, just like my [Polish] huband's mum would make.  I mean, they have a lot of great stuff on the menu...stuff imported right from Eastern Europe and there are only a very few other places in Calgary that you'd find these items.   If you've heard a rumor they make the best Perogies on this side of Canada...it's completely true ;)"}
{"text":"Setting the expectations - Heritage Deli is the place where you can get a bunch of excellent, fresh food from Poland, and where you can also bring a couple of friends to enjoy the same food, professionally prepared, right there on the spot!  However, this is not a restaurant - rather a useful combination of lunch spot and food store.  My review is written more from a lunch place perspective, and as such you will run out of menu options after just a few visits... yet I do enjoy coming back, even for the same plates.  Was there many times, never a trouble - absolutely recommended."}
