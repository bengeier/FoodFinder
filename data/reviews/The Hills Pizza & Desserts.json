{"text":"First time visiting this place for my husband and I tonight and we both loved it! Food was great! I had the lasagna which was a huge piece and my husband had Chicken Parmesan. (He was excited it came with 2 chicken breasts!) Salad and bread were great!  Bonus...it was 1/2 off pasta night. Great deal. The owner also gave us a free order of  Zeppole. It was so good!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Would definitely eat here again. And I recommend trying the cookies n creme gelato to top it off"}
{"text":"Food is reasonably good a little high on price. They need to do better in the service department. Parking is easy. They are quick on food delivery but followup leave a bit to be desired"}
{"text":"On a visit to Fountain Hills, I stumbled across The Hills Pizza on Yelp. We needed a nice break and some great pizza after a long day. I loved it as soon as I walked in the door! It happened to be Monday night so half off pizza and $1.00 draft beers , $2.00 bottled beers. Incredibly good pizza , great service. You can definitely tell we had a traditional pizza with half sausage, half pepperoni. The sauce was rich and tasty! The crust is thin and homemade! I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu! Best find yet! The owner, Ken, is very attentive and we were able to chat with him for awhile after our meal! Fountain Hills is in great need of more/better restaurants so I'm spreading the word! Homemade pies and gelato too! I plan on going back a few more times this week! You will not be disappointed! Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"The pesto pizza was out of this world, the meatballs were moist, flavorful & cooked to perfection!  And then the desserts... my absolute favorite with a twist, pineapple inside out cake - delish! And my husband loved the Michigan cherry - brought back childhood memories!  All around wonderful lunch!"}
{"text":"The pizza was OK. However, the wings were terrible and not thoroughly cooked. I called to inform owner and no offer of a refund."}
{"text":"Moving to Fountain Hills from Manhattan, New York, 20 years ago, there's lots of things to love, but the pizza was not one of them. Discovering the Hills' Pizza was a jolt of nostalgia and good eats. The food is excellent, right on the money, priced right and very friendly.

If you're looking for NY restaurant-style pizza with all the trappings, the Hills' is your go-to."}
{"text":"This place met and fully exceeded expectations the guy running the restaurant sat down at the table next to us and spent time putting together balloon animals for my kids. He actually had them twist the balloon to create the animals. Now let's talk about the food. I got the Philly cheese steak sub and it was delicious. My kids got pizza, and wings. And my wife got the Italian sub. All ahhhhhhhhh mazing. Meal ended with fresh zepoli. If you're in fountain Hills do yourself a favor check out the hills."}
{"text":"If you are thinking of New York Style Pizza, THIS IS THE PLACE.  It was the right thickness, had the right amount of fresh cheese (from New York), and the sauce wasn't too sweet or tart. Great pizza worth the try!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Have tried before but it's been awhile. So got a spaghetti meatball dinner with garlic bread to go.  Picked up in 3 different bags, ok no problem. The dinner salad was in a tiny container with spring mix, lots of black olives, bananna peppers, and huge slices of onion that's it. Spaghetti tasted bland. Something you would get at a nursing home (caffateria style) mushy gross meatballs. Garlic bread sucked. 17$ later, never again!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Went with the family for a birthday and it was perfect. Food was awesome! Definately the place to go in Fountain Hills for Italian food/pizza."}
{"text":"A great evening! We had the carne and pepperoni pizza and a side of ken the owner. This was our second try at dinner at the hills after a bumpy Valentine's Day experience where this small restaurant was run off its feet. We spoke to kens wife on the way out and she offered her apologies and gift certificates for a return visit. When we made it back we were treated to amazing people and some of the best pizza we have had. This included a impromptu version of oh Canada sang by a group of regulars to celebrate our and the table next to us visit. Go support these guys! They are the real deal!!!"}
{"text":"Well, slap me silly and call me Jane.

Not actually. Don't touch me. You know what? Don't even look at me.

But if you have some of this pizza, then pass the slice 'mon! As we say in thee islands. Wait, why did my voice just get Jamaican? I don't even know.

Came here on vacation. I wasn't expecting much from the outside, but the pizza we had on the inside changed my life. Yes, a pizza changed my life. I know, I know. It sounds weird. But it happened. Listen to me damn it. You have to believe me. This pizza changed my life.

That fresh made sausage? What the hell is that? Best thing I've ever tasted. And now I can't ever eat pizza without thinking about it. I sleep and wake up dreaming of that shit. It's not even fun at this point. You ruined pizza for me.

The owner came by and was all friendly, making jokes and making friends. Listen buddy, you better get the hell outta here before I kidnap you and bring you back to LA so you can make me daily pizzas in my basement.

Ha-ha! Just kidding! Everybody knows we don't have basements in LA. Earthquakes dude. Sheesh. Read a book or something.

Anyway, we even had dessert afterwards. Now, normally I don't have dessert, but we had it. And it was great. Just great dessert. So have dessert. It was great. How was it? I just told you. Are you not listening? If you're not listening then why are you even here? Just go already. Yeah, yeah, just go.

But if I'm ever here again, I'm coming. Yeah, I'm coming. In more ways than one. Wait, was that a sexual innuendo? Breathe easy 'mon 'cause I don't know. It's what we say on thee islands my friend. Wait, Jamaican again? Really? What's even happening here?"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite pizza places, this is due to the excellent food and impeccable service delivered from their extremely attractive staff. Jordan my waiter tonight made my experience one I will remember every time I eat a slice of pizza. His hair is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday to see Judy R. at 5pm.  Not able to sit in dining room without a reservation even though tables were open for at least an hour. Servers were pleasant, owner not so much. Sarcastic, rude and inattentive to nonregulars. I'll go see Judy somewhere that appreciates new clientele and has a warm and welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place yesterday and decided to eat an early dinner here. We arrived around 4:30, were immediately seated as there were only two other diners in the restaurant.

After six months of living in Arizona one of our main food goals was just to find a local pizzeria that served good authentic New York style pizza. God has it been a challenge. While the place isn't fancy in decor, more no frills and not located in a fancy strip mall, this place sure delivered a great pie.

We started with a combo order of breaded zucchini and mushrooms and ordered a small meat lovers pie. The appetizer combo came out steaming hot, as in temperature, with the zucchini being nicely breaded and the mushrooms over breaded (some pieces almost burnt). It was a good starter and super filling. As far as taste, the breading wasn't overly salty or flavored, it was just a okay.

Now let's to the pie. The pie arrived, still hot but the crust was cooling down. Now when I talk about something being cool I'm referring to the firmness of the crust with all the toppings on it. There is nothing worst then eating a slice and the crust and bottom starts falling apart. The crust on this pie was just perfect.

As far as the toppings, while I always love to order a meat lovers pie, I liked the nice amount of onions and bell peppers the were also scattered on the pie. Not too much but just the right amount. The only thing that could of been improved were the meatball toppings which came out a little burnt, just like a few of the breaded mushrooms but overall the taste of the pie was 4.0 out of 5 stars. Yummy.

Service was nice, owner was nice enough and this place is on our list to return. We are def coming coming back here to try the lunch menu as it was nicely priced with not only pizza deals but also spaghetti and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by it's remote location because this place is definitely worth checking out.  We just moved here from Oregon and can't believe we have this place right close by us.  The owner is friendly and checks up on you to make sure all is good.  You can tell he truly cares. 

Oh, almost forgot to mention that they have some tasty jazz as well as other live music that you immediately know that it's not amateur's night."}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza I've had in years. Wings were tasty and Zeppolis were fantastic. Prices were very fair. The place is homey and clean. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We love the sausage pizza sliced long strips of sausage, so tastey!  Want to try other dishes but crave this pizza! Next time I will take a pic of the pizza :) 
Also the breakfast! The breakfast bread and magic butter! Delicious! Waiting for the breakfast calzone"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining in at The Hills' Pizza and Desserts last Wednesday, and was delighted with their attentive and friendly service. My daughter and I were first greeted at the door by the owner (Ken) who did a fabulous job entertaining my 2 year old with balloon twisting and cool little magic tricks. We ordered a large half pepperoni pizza that was baked to perfection! The crust was nice and not chewy like other places. The cheese literally melts in your mouth! The pizza sauce was the best I've ever had! All in all, The Hills Pizza and Desserts has won me over with their great service, great food, and friendly customer atmosphere. I will definitely be coming back and recommend any pizza lover to give this place a try."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this and I am so happy I went!

This little, out-of-the-way pizza joint is just what I needed. Excellent thin crust pizza, cold beer and outstanding pie. You must try their White Pizza. 

Beautiful, fresh salad, big enough we ordered one to share. 

We also had the meatballs with sauce - the perfect meal. Their sauce is the bomb. Not overpowering in any way. Just really good sauce. 

Best part - Monday's are $1 beer and half priced pizza nights! 

Got to meet the owner, Ken, when he brought out our end of meal coffee. Good guy who was of course happy to hear we were satisfied first timers who would definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Hills Pizza and Desserts is a quaint pizzeria tucked away north of Fountain Hills. While we dined in, Ken, the new owner made balloon animals for the kids and engaged in friendly conversation with everyone. The restaurant is clean and comfortable. We ordered the special - 18\" Sicilian pizza with a dozen chicken wings (BBQ & Spicy) for $20. We paid extra for additional toppings. The pizza crust wasn't too thick and the crust was perfectly. The tomato sauce had the right amount of spice and zest sprinkled with just the right amount of cheese. The chicken wings were meaty and the sauces tasty. For dessert, we decided to take home a Pecan and Almond Joy Pie made by a Pie shop in Mesa. These were rich, but delicious. It's obvious that Ken is passionate about making this THE neighborhood pizzeria. It's always great to see owners playing a big role in engaging with their customers, taking the time to get to know them and providing them with the best culinary experience. To add to the experience you can find Judy Roberts and Greg Fishman, both Jazz greats in their own right playing there on Tuesdays. He also encourages local photographers to display their art. A dining experience is more than just food and The Hills' delivers this in spades. Our total bill came to $33 which was very reasonable considering the amount of food we ordered. It's great to have The Hills close by and we have become frequent customers."}
{"text":"My family and I are visiting from out of town and were in the mood for pizza. We checked some reviews and decided on The Hills Pizza & Dessert. We are glad we did. Ken and crew provided great service and suggestions.

We ordered a 22\" thin crust with sausage & pepperoni. Ken suggested half of the pizza what we ordered and the other half with a white sauce and veggies. We said 'sure' why not, do it up and surprise us. We were glad we did. Both halves of the pizza were delicious! The white sauce had sliced tomato, spinach, and mushroom. The traditional side was red sauce, sausage ,and pepperoni. The whole pie was really really good. He even cut it Chicago style for us. ;)

We look forward to coming here again on our next trip out to FH."}
{"text":"Just came from The Hills which was wonderful as always. In my opinion this unique restaurant offers the most authentic, best tasting Italian food in town. The atmosphere is warm, clean and embracing, service by Sandy  couldn't have been better.    All dishes are fresh, with delicious sauces and made from scratch.  Fresh salad, Wedding soup (omg), chicken piccata, even Italian soda and yummy desserts.  Everything we had was excellent, reasonably priced with generous portions. Enjoyed a nice conversation with Ken, the owner, who cares about his customers, is passionate about his business, embraces our community and continuously gives back.  Highly recommend this FH community gem!"}
{"text":"Best New York style pizza in the valley. Perfect crust not soggy like most.  Drove 35 miles from home but was glad we did. Ken the owner was very nice and made sure everything was perfect. The staff Mia and Olivia were super nice also. Spaghetti with meatballs and sausage...yes.  Italian zeppoles for dessert...perfect. Do yourself a favor. Tell them Allen B sent you!"}
{"text":"I would give 6 stars if I could! Not only does this place have great food and excellent service but they are SUPER supportive of the Fountain Hills community.  This restaurant is supporting our high school special needs class by giving them real-life skills experiences.  They are so kind and patient- doesn't get more giving than this! Fast service, reasonable prices and great all around place!
The owner is AMAZING.  Monday nights- 50% off pizza and $1 beers!! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, fantastic crust, chewy and flavorful, homemade lasagne, great meatballs and spaghetti...a welcoming owner who supports the community and reasonable prices. We highly recommend and will be back, even though we live in Queen Valley!"}
{"text":"Wowow!!! The pizza really is authentic and delicious. The servers were incredibly friendly and attentive. Dessert presentation is fantastic. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza!!  But service is lacking-forgot my order once, made a big mistake on my order the next time. It's a crap shoot."}
{"text":"Had the New Year special....fabulous!!!  Second time we have been there and definitely won't be the last."}
{"text":"Excellent tasty food. Pizza like New York or Chicago. So much better than the chains. Pasta dishes are quality and taste of Italy. Highly recommend for lunch, dinner or pick up. Only delivers in winter."}
{"text":"What a wonderful evening!!  Love the decor as well as our food, drink and best pie (other than mine).  Please support this new establishment! Can't wait to go back.  Maybe tomorrow for pizza?? Maybe Tuesday for the entertainment? The owner is really trying and I hope he succeeds. Please fellow Yelp users, go to this restaurant !!!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for take out pizza while visiting my dad. This was the option that was not a pizza chain. The pizza was ready in 20 minutes, I was there a little early and sat and waited. The staff was very nice the price was very reasonable and everyone really liked the pizza. My only regret was that I did not try the pie. I will be back."}
{"text":"Came back after not ordering for months, as the last take out order had one bite out of each item and went right into the garbage. Thought I'd try it again, as we were only getting pizza. The first 2 slices were good, and when we went for another slice each the rest of the pie crust was black. Will not be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"Very nice place, friendly people and family atmosphere. Prices very reasonable and great pizza, also other Italian dishes available. Tonight we were lucky since we got to enjoy piano music player by Dr Bill Rhodes. Very good experience."}
{"text":"First off the pizza is very good, add in the price and you can't get a better deal!  We went there on a Monday so Pizza was buy one get one 50% off. Beer (including Heineken) are $2.00 for a bottle!!!  We had nine of us and had 3 pizzas, 10 beers, 2 garlic knots, a spaghetti, zeppolis and an Italian ice!!  All were very good, and all for under $50.00!!  Then Ken came out and made fun things out of balloons for the kids!  Great place!  I'll be back next Monday!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and was glad we did. Good food , good people and good prices... Nuff said . Ken was more than a gracious host and sent us home with yummy zeppolini!"}
{"text":"If you want an excellent, authentic italian meal, this is your place. It has a relaxed feel, friendly atmosphere and the price is right!! Go to The Hills, you will love it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a chain restaurant. This is not the place for you.  If you are looking for really fresh ingredients and a great pizza, this is a great choice.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  They make you feel at home.  We would definitely dine their again."}
{"text":"Okay, I don't think I've ever given a pizza place in Arizona a 5 before. Closest thing to NY pizza I've had here. And not just the pizza is good, the sub sandwiches are also excellent. The layout is a bit funky, with an outer room, and inner room and a rear room used for large groups. The décor is utilitarian, but who cares with food of this quality at these prices."}
{"text":"Super good experience at The Hills Restaurant. A quaint and comfortable neighborhood trattoria for tasty fresh Italian food, pizza, deserts, beer and wine and on the weekend some music too. I appreciate good food and friendly staff. I give The Hills Pizza & Desserts a strong five star review and suggest others find this hidden gem soon."}
{"text":"I went back here again recently and so happy with the delicious pizza and pie. The owner made my grand daughter a beautiful balloon sculpture. I love this place! They are constantly coming up with great events with live music and more. It's very evident that the owners do not just have this as a business but they truly care about our community and being good role models as a company."}
{"text":"WONDEFUL JAZZ!! Great meal. Great spot in Fountain Hills. We'll be back on jazz night."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I (we are both Italians from New York ) rode out to fountain Hills via the Rio Verdi loop from Scottsdale on his motorcycle. Before we left we were looking for a good place for pizza on Friday night. When we showed up it was kind of early so the employees/owners were just sitting around - the greeting could've been a little bit friendlier. I gave this three stars and I would've given it four but... The pizza was good but it was not great and the crust was a little bit soggy. The place could use some updating and the employees/owners could be a little bit more personable. The meatballs were dense which means they were overworked and the dessert pies were store-bought. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Really good local pizza! Beats local chains any day! The owner is extremely nice and you can tell he really cares about his business. Support local businesses (and yummy pizza!) They have great pizza specials and the place gets busy on jazz night."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great Jazz on Tuesdays. Just heard Judy Roberts. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. I wanted the Sicilian style pizza but at 6pm, they were all out of the dough. So I got the regular thin crust NY style. To be fair, I'm from Chicago so I'm not a fan of NY style pizza as a favorite but love pizza in general. The crust was very thin-like paper thin, not a lot of flavor and pretty greasy. I know people that don't mind their pizza but mine was also burnt on the bottom. You could even smell that it was burnt so I'm not sure why it was ever handed to me.  I was too hungry to bring it back, not to mention turning food away never ends well for the customer."}
{"text":"The absolute BEST pizza around!  Eggplant parm and garlic knots are also favorites, but everything we ever ordered has been excellent both dine in and for catering.  Ken the owner is great.  He teaches balloon making on saturday mornings, the kids love it.  Delicious gelato and pie selection for desert also."}
{"text":"I called a couple days prior and made a reservation for a party of 8. Our food literally came out to us an hour and 15 minutes later. They repeatedly told be that they only had one big oven and that their pizzas are individually made. The pizzas came out undercooked or the crust was burnt- a friend ordered a calzone and it literally was doughy in the middle. Just terrible service all around. This business can not handle a big party and they should be smart enough to realize that. Management needs to get it together."}
{"text":"Referred here by a friend.  We stopped as a foursome for dinner on a Sat eve.  Pow!  They nail a white pizza!  We added sliced tomato and basil to the thin crust, white pizza, and it was delish.  A great salad app, very doable wine & beer selection.  Service was EXCELLENT.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This is my new go to spot for lunch! 5$ for 2 slices and a drink. Not to mention the pizza is authentic NY style. Greasy and you need extra napkins. But that's a good thing if your from back east! There pizza dough is the best part, the crust is perfect! If you haven't been here yet, run don't walk!!! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"It was our first visit to Fountain Hills.  My girlfriend and I checked the web for local restaurants.  We chose The Hills Pizza & Desserts and we are glad we did!  We shared a New York style pizza with sausage, jalapeños, and roasted red peppers.  The sauce is excellent.  It was Monday after 4pm so it was $1 beer and half price pizza!  The owner was very polite and made us try some Zeppoli for dessert, like we had room for them, but they were awesome and we highly recommend splitting a bag of them.

We will return and try other offerings that look yummy.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"We really liked this place when it was Mojo's - new ownership and new name, and the menu states that it's still serving Mojo's pizza.
Before last night, we'd been once under the new ownership, I believe shortly after they took over. We just hadn't had a chance to go back until recently.

I've heard a number of complaints from my local friends, but because I once loved this pizza I thought I needed to give it a shot for myself. So we called for pick up and were told 25-30 minutes. We got there and no one was dining in, there were 2 people waiting on to-go orders and two people behind the counter. The staff was nice, one of them I recognized from before and remember him being helpful and nice.

We got there probably right at the 30 minute mark. The gal asked our name and went back to check on the pizza and came back and whispered something to her male counterpart - as I recall, they both went into the back (or maybe she did) and then she came back out and told us it'd be 10 minutes. It was a few more than 10 minutes, because it was a solid 60 minutes after we phoned in our order that it was brought out to us  (cell phone time check).
I'm a little disappointed - yeah, the pizza was slow and we may have been forgotten about. Hey, sometimes it happens, we've all screwed up at work. BUT we didn't get an \"I'm sorry\" or \"thanks for the wait\". Not even when he brought the pizza out. I don't know if this is an employee issue or a management one - or maybe a bit of both. The very least the employees could have done was to acknowledge our wait; an acknowledgement goes a long way. Management's fault is not empowering the employee with the ability to say, \"Sorry for the wait, can I offer you a soda while you wait?\" It costs nothing to acknowledge and only a few cents for them to offer a beverage while we wait. 
AND, you never know, I may have purchased a beer if offered a soda. Thus a bit more income to the day's sales.

The pizza ... the reason why you go to a pizza place. They still use sliced sausage, instead of ground, which we usually prefer. I felt like there was less sauce on it than there used to be (their sauce REALLY was good, no reason to skimp on it in my opinion). Among the complaints I've heard about that the pizza is very greasy. We ordered pepperoni/sausage, and with that kind of pizza comes an expectation of a certain amount of grease. I don't think the pizza was greasy beyond that of my expectations. I DO think, however, that the pizza was a little more soggy in the center (although, I did always ask for 'extra crispy' when I called them because I have always thought their pizza slice a little softer than I care for). You know how a Napoletana is softer on the inside and almost tears apart?  That's kind of how I found these slices. 
After talking with my husband, we think it's a temperature problem. We don't think that the pizza oven is hot enough, thus the soggy center.

The taste was good, though, and I am pleased to see their continued use of the sliced sausage."}
{"text":"My wife, father and I had lunch at the Hills today and throughly enjoyed the service, the food, and how the owner made us feel like family! Thanks MJ and Ken for the great experience."}
{"text":"So a group of came here based on the yelp reviews and were sadly disappointed.  The food is terrible, Olive Garden is better than this.   The lasagna had no taste whatsoever.  Three of us only one had an entree and we only received one little piece of bread for the person who ordered the entree even though their were three at the table.  It was a disaster.  We did not order the pizza but anyone can make pizza.  No one bothered to check on us or refill our drinks.  The only good thing was the salad which everyone seemed to like.  But this definitely is not real Italian food.  Costco makes better lasagna then here.   Might try the pizza but definitely not any other food. yuck"}
{"text":"Great food and service at this local restaurant. Ken the owner is super friendly and made the kids balloon animals. The young servers that work there are very friendly and efficient. It's always a pleasure eating here. Try to go on a Monday when they have 1/2 price pizza. Very affordable."}
{"text":"Just tried this place after my son's basketball game. It was great.  The food and service was fun and very attentive. My favorite dish was the white pizza with tomato and spinach."}
{"text":"Tried this place 3 times, just to give it a chance.
We just moved into town and we wanted to find a local restaurant. The first time I had ravioli there was more water in the bowl because they didn't drain them before the put them on the plate. The second time it was hot inside and we had to skip to cool it down. The third and the last time we went, we walked out. The owner is way over his head in running a restaurant. I'm sure it won't be in business long. So I might try it again when new owners take it over.
They have a full bar but don't ask for a drink, it's too much trouble for them when they have tables to serve.
Stay away from this place so you don't get a bad feeling about other good restaurants in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"This used to be Mojo's.  Liked them last year when we were in the area. Tried them tonight and was disappointed. Got a large pizza with sausage and pepperoni. Toppings were lacking and pizza was swimming in grease. Didn't finish it cause it wasn't that great.  I know they are under new ownership hence the name change. Not sure if they have the same cook or not. When I went inside to pick up pizza they had jazz duo entertaining a nice crowd. I hope they do well but sorry to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"After experiencing their food at a catered event, I decided to give them a try.  Picked up a 'to-go' chicken salad, enjoyed it, liking the rosemary mayo.  When my husband came back in town, I suggested we try it for supper.  I'd had the Butternut Ravioli at the previous event and looked forward to renewing my love affair with the dish.  The place was almost full (a good sign) and we sat ourselves. We were quickly greeted and ordered as we were hungry.  My husband ordered the sausage roll (sausage, peppers and onion in a thick fold of pizza dough) while I went for the ravioli, both got salads.  Our salads came promptly but she brought my ravioli at the same time.  It was a bowl, with a few ravioli, (not even so much as a sprinkling of parsley to make a presentation ) I asked if this was the dinner portion, thinking it looked like a sampler.  It was warm and I didn't want it to get cold so I ate it. It was delicious, tho not quite the same as the catered sauce.  20 minutes later, they came to apologize for the delay...husband still didn't have his meal!  10 min later, we were told two minutes ... one oven was broken and things were delayed.  Now things like that happen but when there's a problem, patrons should be forewarned so that they can order another item.  We were offered free dessert so we did take them up on it.  As for the Sausage roll, the end was mostly dough with some leaked cheese which he cut off, then got to the 'meat ' of it.  Said it was great.  Since I'd finished my meal long since, I took a piece of the discarded dough from his plate and it WAS delicious!  I'll definitely come back for the pizza...best dough ever.  Suggestions?  Warn people if you're having trouble with serving some dishes, bring all meals to the table at the same time.  The servers were young and very anxious to please, filling our glasses, clearing promptly.  I'll be back for the great food!"}
{"text":"This place is Delicious!! Me and my family love their Pizza and Subs, the desserts are amazing. Everything we have ever tried wether it be pizza or pasta has been awesome. Dining in is fun because the owners are extremely cool and actually engage the customers (most places around here don't) and even make balloon animals for the kids and teach the kids how to make them. They even have live jazz once a week. We do takeout a lot and every time we get it home it is just as delicious. Love Love Love This Place!!!!!!!! Highly Recommend It Pizza Lovers!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly prompt service, & welcoming owner!  Nice selection of beer & wines.  Love the pizza!!!!  Live entertainment , call for details.  Intimate neighborhood feel.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our first visit here. Great ambience with cute decor. Off the beaten track but worth going to. 
Tues there was a guitar player that was very enjoyable with easy listening & not invasive of our experience. 
The food was really good. I had eggplant parmigiana & hubby had spaghetti. Good flavor sauces & nice portions. 
Service was fine & owner was welcoming & friendly. 
We are looking forward to many return dining experiences. 
The bread is flown in from Philly weekly & tastes amazing too!  
Go.  You will be glad you did. 
Great neighborhood place"}
{"text":"Friendly, small restaurant.  Great service and one heckuva a nice owner.  I'll have to try everything on the menu sooner or later."}
{"text":"New York Style Pizza,  Great Chicken Parmigiana, Lasagna and the chicken Cutlet salad is great.  Super reasonable prices and a nice menu.  Lots of pizza choices as well.  The owner made a balloon rose for my mom and she loved it.  Great Jazz on Tuesday nights.  Really nice family owned restaurant.  Convenient, tastefully decorated and reasonably priced.  We have been here 5 times now.. First time was just for dessert, then had to come back for meals. This is becoming our friday night thing..  love it."}
{"text":"Our family came here based on the yelp reviews and it was only only OK. 
My wife started with the pasta fagioli soup, it was a bit bland. My house salad was very good though. 
My daughters spinach salad was huge and very good as were the wings my son had. 
The problem was the pasta. I had the butternut squash ravioli with a butter garlic sauce and for 6 ravioli, there must have been a half cup of butter. Way oversauced. My wife's angle hair with white clam sauce was also served with way too much sauce and pasta that was a bit over cooked but the sauce was way tasty. I would recommend it with a thicker pasta than angle hair."}
