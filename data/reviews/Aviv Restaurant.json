{"text":"Great service...the place was busy but the staff never seemed rushed or annoyed. The food was excellent! The risotto balls were a surprising treat and the lamb and beef meatballs were sooo delicious!"}
{"text":"Summerlicious menu. Lunch menu is fish and seafood focused - $18. Came in a pair and split all items. Patio is nice but we chose to sit inside. Decor is pleasant as was staff. Ordered the fattoush salad and risotto balls. Salad was underdressed but topped with copious amounts of olive oil. Pita was crisp and tasty. Risotto balls came in a pair and were served in a lightly smoked tomato sauce with a basil pesto. Was very satisfying. For mains we ordered the smoked trout salad with Dijon dressing, snap peas, hard boiled egg and potato. The trout was perfect but a small 2-4oz serving. Snap peas were blanched perfectly but potatoes were slightly undercooked for my liking. The shrimp linguini was flavourful with a wonderful rich tomato sauce. The shrimp were over-cooked and slightly fishy. Linguini was cooked perfectly. For dessert we ordered the crumble and banana bread pudding. There was supposed to be Nutella in the bread pudding but if there was we didn't get any. The caramel was flavourful and the dish itself was better than the crumble which had 1-1.5oz of vanilla ice cream, a mixture of berries and somewhat soggy oatmeal crust. In closing the meal was okay with its highs and lows but I would love to come back and try their full menu at some point."}

{"text":"In town visiting from NY. Took the 2 existing Yelp reviews and came in with group of 5. Awesome food/service/ETC to the point that one person in our group exclaimed, \"If I lived here, I'd come every weekend.\""}
{"text":"This place was ok. Stopped in for lunch. Ambiance is a bit lacking as it's pretty dark in there. The service was friendly and efficient. Not complaints on that. The grilled cheese sandwich was decent. The side garden salad wasn't great. Wilted lettuce, only a few pieces of cucumber and tomato and a flavourless dressing. Overall nothing special and I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Had a great meal at Aviv with friends on New Years Day!  Awesome service, great food, and convenient location!  I'm looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal at Aviv. Fresh, flavourful, homemade food with warm service and insanely good prices for Toronto. Three of us enjoyed brunch and mimosas for less than $60. Go."}
{"text":"I came to Aviv for winterlious but I will be back because of the service and food.   The special menu was nice but I really couldn't wait to come back to try the regular menu which some of the items for winterlious are also offers all the time.  The Owner was friendly and adressed us as soon as we walked in and the lady that took over was obsolutley amazing.  Tammy was busy but still made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant.  She was funny and really took the time to direct us in the right direction for food and beverages.   My family and I are looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Brunch at AVIV was great!! We had a large group of ten and service and food was terrific. Three of us had burgers. Fresh ground meat and caramized pinion on a house made brioche type bun!!! Hand cut French fries. Burger was delicious and tasty. Highlight on the table was the egg shashukah!!!!OMG!! I will run back for this!!!! Middle eastern style poached egg with tomatoes and cheese!! You gotta eat this!! We had granola, also in house made. For desert in house ice cream!!! Man this chef must be super busy! He makes everything fresh and home made!! Wow! The server was lovely and warm. We were cared for , never rushed and don't forget the bellenis!!! We will be back for dinner! Great neighbourhood place I'm so glad we found it!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch, the menu is quite diverse,  I recommend the Yiddish Egg Benedict, friendly staff great food and live music while you eat."}
{"text":"Service was amazing, Robert(server) was uber friendly, with a great sense of humour! Good came fast. Delicious burger and nice cozy patio."}
{"text":"This is an amazing new restaurant with some of the best food, and definitely the best service I've had in all of Toronto. Went there the first time when Fanny Chadwicks was too full up for brunch, and brought a gang of 10+ people. The food was amazing (great home made preserves and condiments too), and everyone's coffee and water was kept quite full.  Went back again for dinner a few days later, and had one of the best pizzas of my life. Fresh baked bread was delicious with olive oil and balsamic, and a house made chili infused oil was fantastic."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch with the fam. Great little restaurant with delicious homemade jam. Try the shakshuka it's tasty, hearty and had quite a kick to it. Or server was really friendly and gave solid recommendations. I'll definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Aviv opened quite recently and is my new favourite local restaurant. It was recommended to us by friends, and we had a most enjoyable dinner there two nights ago. We started with two appetizers - calamari and carpaccio, both delicious - and my companion had the fish of the day, beautifully cooked and well presented, and I had an excellent personal pizza Margherita, also very good. You can bring your own wine to Aviv, and on Tuesdays and Wednesdays there is no corkage fee. The cost was very reasonable for what we had. The service was most attentive, it's an attractive and unpretentious place, and it deserves to be very successful. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Top class lunch!  Fresh mussels from PEI in a white wine, garlic & tomato sauce.  Good coffee!  Great service!"}
{"text":"Brunch is really good here. The portions are good and the food is tasty.  Just tried the pizza...it isn't so good. Waaayyy too cheesy and not enough sauce. The base is also odd,  not a typical pizza dough.  Service is good."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch here with exceptional service. The menu is full of options nicely balancing healthy and delicious. They have $0 corkage fees for BYOW on Mondays and Tuesdays. The space is clean and upscale. Had a great $5 caesar. I'll be back - it's certainly the best restaurant on Dupont."}
{"text":"Great spot. The brunch was very tasty, with a large menu offering something for everyone; from Nutella topped banana bread pudding to savoury waffles to basic eggs and bacon with home fries and toast. Food came quickly, and was nice and hot. Good clean flavour, with nice extras like homemade jams. The home fries were nice and crisp, perfectly seasoned. Also worth noting that the service was very friendly and attentive, and much better than some of the hipper spots in the area. The room is larger and less crowded than other nearby options, making it a more relaxing, quiet place for a meal. Large groups can easily be accommodated. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Here after Casa Loma - a nice walk and greeted by a friendly man - owner? manager?  Attentive just enough.  The good was DELICIOUS - had a burger and the grilled cheese with Brie and cheddar - yum!  And inexpensive too.  Def worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Aviv is one of my favorite restaurants in the Annex. Amazing food with friendly staff. The have specials every day of the week (Half-priced bottles of wine on Mondays, corkage free Tuesdays and Thursdays, etc). Everything there is amazing whether it be brunch, lunch, or dinner! Service is attentive and friendly and they have a cute patio in Summer that wraps around two corners of the restaurant. We have tried multiple dishes so far and were never disappointed. Their burger is really good, their lamb shank is to die for, their quinoa/kale salad is so flavorful, gnocchi is perfect and their beef brisket hash (for brunch) is heavenly.  I just can't get enough of Aviv! The prices are super cheap considering the quality and amount of food you get.  I recommend this place 100%. Give Aviv a try, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had never heard of this place prior to booking it during Winterlicious for my birthday dinner with my family. I wasn't quite sure what this place was when I entered, I knew it was described as Mediterranean but that's sort of a broad descriptor when that may include, Middle Easter, Greek, and any number of other cuisines.  I'm still not sure but if I had to wager I guess I might say Israeli-Middle Eastern? At any rate the reviews seemed good and I was open to pretty much anything if it was a birthday treat.  The Winterlicious menu was $25/person and included the standard 3 course offering - Appetizer, Main, dessert.  I won't go into all the details of what we all had but true to form this restaurant subscribed to the Winterlicious formula of discounted prices meaning severely discounted portion sizes. The rib option that my brother ordered was 4 very tiny ribs and the big push here from the server was the sweet potato fries that accompanied it, she mentioned they was amazing. The dish arrived with 4 ribs and regular fries. There wasn't even a courtesy \"Oh I'm sorry to let you know we are out of_______\" before hand, just food arrived and put down like we wouldn't notice. my brother asked and was given a flippant - \"Yes we're out of those\". No apology, no concessions made... just basically, here are fries.  My meal was OK. To start I had the beef carpaccio appetizer which was two very thin slices on a plate, ok, but an amuse bouche at best... not a appetizer. I had the chicken kebab on rice. Which came with a 1/4 piece of pita. Really a quarter of a piece? Are you saving that much money on the bread? The chicken however made up for it in how plump and juicy each piece was and in how it was seasoned.   To end I had the flourless chocolate cake, which was similar to a two bite brownie which I enjoyed. What made me mad here was again they skimped on things that were silly. Each of us had a dessert and each was a total disappointment. My parents each had the fruit crumble dessert and one of them got a small portion and the other got 1/4 of what the other got. Anyone who had tiramisu looked like the received half of a small triangle piece - imagine if someone grabbed a fork and took the entire tip off your triangle slice of cake - yeah that.  I went in trying to make this a 4 star but the substitutions without notice, the cut corners in random places. They get full marks on taste but lose the rest on value for money and staff.  I'd be willing to return and try them out again at full price to see if they're as \"portion conscious\" as they were during Winterlicious, but that won't be for awhile again."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since it was no longer called 'Diverso'.  We are vegetarian and love their pizzas.  The other day we ordered the 'Fatoosh' salad (which means there is broken bread in the salad) - lovely toasted crispy pieces of pita.  We had never had it before - just delicioius!  We also come here for brunch with the family - there is something for everyone.  In the summer it's great to have the outside covered patio to watch the world walk by.  Service is very attentive."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends I haven't seen in forever at Aviv for Stop 2 of my Winterlicious adventures. It was very busy! We only waited a few minutes before we were seated by the owner. He was serving, clearing tables and greeting people; he was on top of things! He apologized for the wait even though there wasn't really one long enough to complain about. He had a good sense of humour about it and laughed at my jokes, so he was already winning in my books! ;)   We ordered drinks and made our selections. Yay for appetizers; we were starving! The Risotto Balls were fabulous. Smoked tomato sauce smothered over Italian arborio rice stuffed with buffalo mozzarella and wild mushrooms and drizzled with basil pesto. Doesn't that sound heavenly?? It was!    I've had Gnocchi a thousand times. I love it. This was unexpected! It's called Housemade Potato Gnocchi, but it was more like little fluffy clouds with a smooth texture, almost like melted cheese covered in a savoury tomato cream sauce. I didn't want to share even one bite with my friends. Traditionally, potato gnocchi are denser, but these were very light; the portion was the perfect size.   I love that Winterlicious comes with dessert, so I don't have to feel guilty about having it. :D On with the theme, I had the Light & Fluffy Lemon Cheesecake. I didn't taste any lemon, but the cheesecake was indeed light and fluffy. The blueberry compote stole the show. It was a great finish to a savoury meal and not too sweet.   The service was really stellar. The owner and our server were warm and funny. Both taking a few minutes to chat like we went there all the time. I really liked the atmosphere and their regular menu looks good. I'll have to come back! That's what Winterlicious is for!!   Until we meet again, Aviv!"}
{"text":"So the boy and I were home in the evening and wanted to order in. We had never tried uber eats before, so I downloaded the app and gave it a go. After Pershing, we went with Aviv. We ordered two calzones-one with salami cheese and mushrooms (Roma Calzone), a margherita calzone, an order of calamari and an order of Risotto balls.   The food was prepared and in its way in a very reasonable amount of time. The food was still warm, considering the travel time (approximate 20 minutes in just travel time). The calamari was good; I expected it to have become rubbery as it made its journey to us, but that was not the case. The two dipping sauces, Romesco and black olive aioli, were both yummy. I didn't know what to expect with the black olive aioli as, generally speaking, I'm not an olive kind of girl. In the end, when the calamari was done, we decided to be fat and dip the rice balls and calzones into the left over sauces. Scrumptious.   Rice balls...I guess they were good. I had half of one...I've just never been a rice ball kinda girl (I've noticed that this review makes me look like an overly picky eater. I'm not, I swear). That said, we received 3 rice balls. For $10 I would have expected 4. Even numbers are always better. We wondered if the delivery guy got hungry and ate one. If so, we appreciate the fact that it was a long journey; no hard feelings.   The calzones...we should have only gotten one. It was hugeeee. My boyfriend enjoyed his margherita calzone. Me personally...I didn't really like the salami. It just wasn't my taste...and my calzone was jam packed with them. I removed some so that my boyfriend could shove them into his meatless calzone. Main gripe about the meal-too much salami in the calzone and the peculiar number of rice balls. Negative one star for that.  Overall, we both enjoyed our meals and were glad with the choice we made . Also pleased that they gave us a very generous side of sauce for dipping (we asked for some on the side). I wouldn't mind actually dining in the restaurant, or perhaps trying different menu items when ordering in."}
{"text":"I recently celebrated my birthday at Aviv and had a really good time. The owner was really nice and said he would have a gluten and lactose free dessert for me since it was my birthday. When we spoke it was as if he was going to make my group a chocolate cake but when we celebrated, I was brought some macaroons and chocolate cookies. I think he over promised and under delivered and it made the end of the night slightly disappointing.   The Good!   At this restaurant the bar tender is famous. The bar tender is from this show called the Thirsty Traveler. My friend recognized him from the show and we asked if he could come over to our table for some photographs. He accepted our enquiry and was a true sport. We got tons of photos and he was really nice. He also made me his best drink and it was superb. It was a grapefruit martini and it was really refreshing!  The food at Aviv was good. It didn't knock me out of the park but it was fine. My appetizer was ceviche. I absolutely love ceviche. It is one of my favourite meals and the ceviche tasted great!  Next, I tried the Moroccan Vegetable Tagine. It was also really good. On the winterlicious menu, this was the only entree I could order. I was a little disappointed because I would have liked to try the cod. However, the Tagine tasted good.  My friends seem to have liked their dishes. One friend ordered a pizza and said it was fantastic. One of my friends who ordered another dish (not sure which one) said she should have ordered the pizza.  There was also one flaw. We placed 11 orders and one of the orders didn't arrive. I felt so bad eating my entree in front of my friend. She encouraged everyone to eat their meals. I kept trying to get the attention of the waiters/waitresses to come and address her missing entree. It was hard to get any of their attention. Once a waitress arrived, she apologized profusely and placed her order again saying they messed up in the kitchen. My friend had to wait a long time to get her dish. I felt so bad for her and she said she was really hungry.  Allover I would give Aviv three stars. The food is good and the bartender is awesome!"}
{"text":"I love this small restaurant. Decoration is really interesting and unique. Most importantly, They offer the best pizza in town. It is as good as those one i had in Italy. They also offer weekends brunch and my husband love their toasts. They have daily special every day. For example On Monday the restaurant offer discounted price of bottle of wine. On Tuesday you can bring your own bottle of wine free of charge. I'll defiantly go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"N.B. this review is for dinner service only.   Are most of the Yelpers who gave this spot 5 STARS (?!) a) friends with the owner b) huge fans of their brunch (is it actually good-  really?) c) indulging in Aviv's free corkage nights before writing their reviews?    I will agree that the server(/owner?) is incredibly friendly and attentive and I will grant 5 stars for the service which is great. However, that's where my positive comments end. I feel bad giving this extremely nice guy a less than glowing review (two stars is actually pushing it, tbh) and plus the location puts Aviv at a disadvantage being below ground and all. But still, my truth must be told...   It's not a coincidence that this place is mostly empty while other Dupont spots (e.g. Farmhouse Tavern, Universal Grill, Roti Cuisine of India, Fat Pasha, Fanny Chadwicks, Ezra's, Live, Rose & Sons/Big Crow, Playa Cabana etc.) are pretty consistently bustling with life. These other places have decent food and at least a few memorable aspects. Aviv was forgettable to the point that I forgot to write this review a few months ago.  I live in the general hood and was excited to see that the meh-worthy \"Diverso by Ferraro\" had been replaced by what was labeled as a Mediterranean restaurant. I was a bit skeptical from the start for some reason, but was slightly encouraged to check this place out by the glowing reviews I saw on Yelp.   Unfortunately, it almost seemed like Ferraro, but repackaged and expanded to attract more business. The food was fair at best - nothing imaginative or particularly tasty. Maybe the pizzas are good? I stayed away due to my negative associations with Ferraro pizza, but that could have been my mistake... Anyway, I was pretty disappointed. I wanted to like Aviv!   I find Kent P.'s assertion that this is \"certainly the best restaurant on Dupont\" to be positively preposterous!  Off the top of my head I can think of at least half a dozen good places on Dupont and it would be generous to even place Aviv in the same league. Aviv is living in b-land. No, that's not basement land-  it's just bland.   The casual atmosphere and TV screens make me feel like this place should actually be a sports bar or something. Not a bad thing at all (mmm bring on the wings) but it's just not what the current Aviv has been billed to be.  Again, I don't like dumping on a local business (or fellow Yelpers). I do want to support smaller spots, but this place needs some feedback if it wants to survive in the long run. I will check out their brunch sometime to see if this is what the handful of \"Woohoos!\" are all about."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious and some dishes were hit or miss. We definitely liked their pizzas and calamari.  The gnocchi and lamb meatball though were quite flavorful However the Moroccan tangine was not authentic and the carpaccio lacked flavor. All in all, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I am appalled by the experience that I had here tonight.   Rated 4.5 stars by fellow Yelpers, I came here for Winterlicious with great anticipation that I would have a splendid meal. My expectations were severely unmet.   Atmosphere: Let's start off with the music that was blaring so loudly that I felt uncomfortable having a conversation across my small table. This place definitely felt more like a pub/bar than a restaurant. The noise level was way too high and I basically reached my yelling capacity where I just needed a break from talking because it was too stressful. And yes, I needed to yell that much. Why? Read on for the next point.  Service: Although we arrived for our reservations at 8pm, which is already considerably late, it took roughly 1hr15mins for our main dishes to arrive. That's right - you read it right. It took over an hour for our food to come and by that point, I had already starved for so long that I lost my appetite. We had originally made post-dinner plans to visit a shop that closes at 10 but by the time we finished our meal, it was already 9:58.. So much for that!   Food: Now onto the real reason why we came here tonight - to try their delicious food that's offered at reduced Winterlicious prices! It's quite unfortunate that I have to say that the food was NOT delicious and only mediocre AT BEST.  Appetizer 1 -  Tunisian Lamb and Veal Meatball = The meat was tough, quite likely overcooked by the darkened edges, and served with a goop of tomato sauce on the most unappetizing-looking plastic plate.  Appetizer 2 - Thai Salmon and Cod Ceviche = I actually quite liked this, it was likely the best part of my meal. The chunks of fish were sizable, the spices and herbs left a tangy aftertaste, and the avocado and mango pieces added a nice hint of freshness. However, again, this was served in a questionable looking plastic bowl.  Main 1+2 - AVIV Dry Rub Baby Back Pork Ribs = Don't read too much between the lines, it literally is DRY rub. I had anticipated and hoped for juicy and savoury meat that would fall apart from the bone but the ribs were very mediocre. The meat wasn't tender or tough, it was just.. meat. The rub was very pungent and layered very heavily on the ribs so drink lots of water between bites and beware of choking on the seasoning!! The sweet potato fries that accompanied the ribs were, again, mediocre at best. The coleslaw was highly disappointing. It was flavourless, lacked colour, and given in a very small portion. Dessert 1 - Tiramisu = I'll give it to them that the layers were thick and creamy but it was definitely lacking flavour. The coffee was barely detectable. Also, the portion sizing was tiny yet again.  Dessert 2 - Fresh Fruit Crumble = This was such a sad, sad excuse of a dessert. It's clear they had prepped these beforehand. It was sliced unknown fruits mixed with granola and drowned in unsweetened strawberry syrup. The colour itself was already enough of a deterrent because it was a bright artificial red. Ontop of that, the fruits were not sweet at all, and the little drop of ice cream was so minuscule that I was almost offended that it wasn't a full scoop..  This restaurant had definitely cut corners for the Winterlicious menu. No doubt. I am highly unimpressed and would not consider coming back, it's not worth the commute to give a second try."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick bite on a rainy Tuesday. The place was surprisingly busy, but I was able to get a table in the corner. Service was friendly and efficient. The food is amazing and the 'Big plates' are, as the name suggests, huge. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Aviv for winterlicious; however, was  quite disappointed about the quality of the food. My boyfriend's steak was cold, my chicken kebab was very dry, and the apple crumble dessert seemed like it came from a grocery store. The service felt rushed and an afterthoughtI-  no offer  to fill  empty  water. I don't like giving unfavourable reviews, but we won't be back to Aviv."}
{"text":"We went for Brunch on a Sunday. They did feed into one of my pet peeves - which is having the menu on the cutlery - I'm not a germaphobe, but this should be a restaurant no no.   Service was very attentive and prompt with coffee - which is exactly what you need for brunch! The menu was a perfect size with delicious items I was going to share a brunch because I often find portions way to large - but my eyes could not avoid the Beef Brisket Hash (which didn't sit right with my vegetarian companion). I ordered that and she ordered the grilled cheese. The hash was delicious though a tad too sweet for my liking. The hot sauce is potent and great.   The grilled cheese was triple decker and great - but the potatoes however were undercooked and hard. I'm a potato guy and these were not up to par. I generally always order potatoes well done but this wasn't my meal (and the potatoes in the hash were a little more done still not amazing).    A good spot that wasn't busy - though if you don't sit near the front it's a tad dark."}
{"text":"Wow. This is the stuff.  This is the hidden gem of an area that is rather lack luster.    Aviv is hidden away in a somewhat regrettably run-down area near Casa Loma, making it a convenient choice for lunch/dinner before or after trekking through the historical site. At first glance, I wasn't so sure about the quality of food and service when my party parked because even the outside of Aviv remains somewhat unkept.  However, lo and behold you're transported to a funky and somewhat high class dining landscape when you pass through the thick velvet curtains at the front.   The service here was phenomenal.  Various servers checked up on us on a regular basis, and one of them included a gentleman that I presume is the owner - that's true devotion to keeping it real with the customer experience.   Food-wise, the portions were just right for a hungry hippo and my party was unanimously positive with the flavour of our dishes. I ordered the burger, the cheaper main dish on the dinner menu.  The burger was juicy and satisfying, even without any additional condiments.  It wasn't a crazy concoction like what you would get from Burger's Priest, but it was a burger that you just couldn't disagree with. Also, the cooks were very generous with the fries that came with the burger as a side.  There were almost as many as what you would get in a bag of fries from Five Guys, and that's saying a lot!  They weren't those soggy fries that sit in the kitchen either. They were salty and crisp, just like how I like them to be.  If I didn't have to go to Casa Loma right afterwards, I would have taken my fries to go instead of feeding them to the restaurant's green bin. The salt is real here!  Long story short, I definitely recommend you to go to Aviv if you're in the area. It's perfect for friends, dates, and family gatherings. You're never going to be short-changed by the service and food, even if it's not in the best type of neighborhood."}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch. Immediately seated when we got in with a very sweet welcome by the man at the bar. It seems like they have a lot of regulars as the man greeted some customers with a big smile and hug. The restaurant definitely has top notch service- they will come to check on you briefly, food came quick, bill came quick, and were overall very friendly. The food was also good food to top it off, the home fries especially"}
{"text":"Usually stick with the gnocchi and a nice pizza but recently I had the duck breast and (special) trout, and it was amazing!. The Trout was cooked perfectly and crispy. Along with the veggies and other things on the plate!"}
{"text":"An exquisite dining experience! We were in the mood for a light and healthy lunch, and they sure delivered. My kale quinoa salad was out of this world - crispy translucent kale pieces were the star of this dish, accompanied by pumpkin seeds, dates, dried apricots, dark lettuce, pistachios, butternut squash, and quinoa. I devoured it all! Then the blueberry lemonade, fresh-made on the premises from real squeezed lemon juice and their own blueberry compote, and garnished with mint. Finally the friendliness and welcomingness of our host made the experience complete, along with the whimsically artistic ambiance. If I am ever in the area again, I'll be sure to come back."}
{"text":"Blueberry lemonade cocktail is fantastic! Duck breast  is pretty fine, but jot impressive though. Quite expensive."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy eating here. Came on Sunday mid-afternoon but still during brunch I guess; first we were told we could order off the lunch menu, but then another server came over and said we couldn't and took the lunch menus away. The calamari was tasteless.  Latkes were tiny, way over cooked and extremely hard. Huge serving of salad but most of it was wilted and rotten with no dressing whatsoever.  Bathrooms are gross."}
{"text":"We love it here! Rob always goes the extra mile to make sure we're happy and the food has been really excellent every time we come. It's a good price point and they give you a ton of booze in your drink, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"We wanted a quick lunch before going to Casa Loma. This was near the subway station and, on a drizzly Sunday, it was snug and warm. We had the brunch menu and it was great."}
{"text":"Visited Casa Loma and rather than eating at the cafe inside, decided to take a stroll around the neighborhood. We stumbled upon Aviv on DuPont. It's a small little restaurant with a nice family feel. The place is a bit dark on a sunny afternoon. Menu has a variety of Mediterranean food. Everyone there was nice and attentive. We all ordered the Aviv burger with fries. Burger was a bit red and dry however it was loaded with sautéed mushrooms. The fries were over cooked and salty. The place was clean but food was mediocre. There was only us and another table occupies during lunch."}
{"text":"We came for the Summerlicious 3-course $18 lunch. We got 2 fattoush salads, linguine with shrimp, fish and chips (replaced the salami sandwich from the menu online), a Nutella bread pudding, and a chocolate mousse.  Fattoush salad was decent (it's salad, after all) - there were mint leaves and pomegranate inside, which was an interesting twist.  The fried fish was dark in colour but tasty - the fries stole the show though, they were hand-cut and fresh.  The shrimp linguine was delicious! I loved the tomato sauce (and there was plenty of it) which had a bit of heat to it.  Both desserts were good - Nutella bread pudding would have been better hot though and with more Nutella.  The owner served us and was VERY engaging and enthusiastic, definitely improved our experience."}
{"text":"Very, very nice place. Casual, cozy with extremely friendly server. Food did not disappoint either. Extremely clean. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The service was good, however the food was really plain and flavourless. I really like Mediterranean food but definitely not here. I had the mazze plate (very plain with no flavour) my mom had the calamari that she said tasted like frozen calamari with not much flavour and my hubby had the Burger and said it was ok. After I had the bread pudding which wasn't even sweet, just a very little so it didn't really tasted like dessert, the bartender didn't make the old fashion that I asked for and invented a drink (you know, you can google it) Anyways not coming back"}
{"text":"I've never gotten such good service before. waitress was so kind and friendly, food was really good went here for winterlicious. interior was lovely and clean."}
{"text":"Came here for a Winterlicious dinner with friends on January 29th.  The restaurant was not what I expected (I thought it was one of those high end fancier restaurants, but boy was I wrong) -- I mean this in a good way!  It was very cozy/homey inside when I was the first to arrive in the party.  The owner (or manager?) was pretty quick to acknowledge me and I was seated quickly.  For a Friday night, it was packed -- not sure if they're super busy all the time or if it was because of Winterlicious, but it seemed like most tables were ordering from their Winterlicious menu...  The appetizer and dessert that I got were great (Thai Salmon and Cod Ceviche, and Tiramisu).  I thought the AVIV Dry Rub Baby Back Pork Ribs main was a bit too dry but the accompanying slaw and sweet potato fries were good.  It took about 25 minutes between the appetizer and main courses to be served -- the manager had stopped by our table to apologize for the wait, which was kind of him to do so.  One interesting thing about the restaurant is how they just blast Top 40 hits... the bathroom sounded very much like a club..."}
{"text":"Wow.  do the people of T.O. know what that have in a place like this? tried 4 different pizzas and MANY appetizers.  Glad we went. Thanks Robert."}
{"text":"If there's a place where the waiters are too friendly, this is it. Someone would poke their head into my conversation and ask if my meal changed in quality between every bite. Almost literally. Unnecessary. When they refilled my water, they spilled onto my phone. Wiped away and not a big deal, but come on.  The food was not great. Came for winterlicious. Had the ceviche, ribs, and fruit crumble with ice cream dessert.  Ceviche was nice. Generous helping of avocado that balanced the tangy lime. Ribs weren't anything great. The jicama salad (bite-sized portion) was off and tasted funny - kind of sour like it had been left out too long. Fruit crumble was too much tart fruit, not enough ice cream.  Overall, disappointing. Will not return."}
{"text":"Wow!!! What a great find!! A cozy neighbourhood restaurant with some great food and even better service. I had the kababs which were great, but my friend had the NY strip special and it was cooked to PERFECTION! Robert, the owner, is a great host and very engaging with the customers; something you don't see a lot of from restaurant owners these days. Simon, our server, was one of the nicest and most genuine I have had anywhere in a long time! We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Food 4.5/5 Service 5/5 Decor 3/5  We were looking for a restaurant that offered ceviche, so we decided to visit Aviv during Summerlicious. Located near Dupont Station, the restaurant isn't too seemly in appearance, but the employees/owners are so kind. Since it was Monday evening, there was only one other table at the restaurant, so they were prompt and attentive throughout our meal.  From the $28 fixed dinner menu, I ordered 1 | Cape Cove Mussels White wine, shallots, garlic, tomato, fresh herbs, chirizo sausage, house-made cornbread 2 | Roast Brome Lake Duck Breast Rubbed in ground fennel with a fresh mango, turmeric, sumac & lime sauce, served with sweet potato mash, sautéed garlic kale & asparagus  3 | Lemon Pound Cake  I loved my meal. Everything tasted fantastic, and I was quite satisfied at the end.  My boyfriend got 1 | Thai Tilapia Ceviche Fresh ginger, chilli pepper, lime, grapefruit, avocado, coconut milk, tamarind, cashews & crispy shallots 2 | Pan Seared Ontario Rainbow Trout Cherry tomato puttanesca sauce with anchovies, capers, black olives, sun-dried tomato, orange & fresh basil, served with soft creamy polenta, sautéed green beans & roasted peppers 3 | Roasted Banana & Creamy Caramel Rice Pudding  The ceviche's flavours had a strong Asian influence, and I would love to be able to recreate that at home. The trout was great as well. The rice pudding wasn't our favourite, mostly due to the unique texture of crunchy rice with mushy pudding.   I like that they had a bit more selection to their Summerlicious menu compared to other restaurants, with five different appetizer and entree selections. The only thing I would complain about is that they served dessert before we were even done our entrees, causing me to feel a bit rushed. Overall, I am happy with my experience at Aviv."}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious, and remembered that this place caters to the Annex which I'd a mix of student and long time residents. That's the type of place this seems to be.   What really appealed to me was that based on the menu it looked like Mediterranean fusion of flavours with lots of fresh and very flavourful ingredients. In terms of winterlicious it was the cheapest option.   The atmosphere was fine. Not a basement per se but a nice spot just off Dupont and Spadina. Lots of street parking. The inside seemed a little confusing, didn't know if it was an old school British pub style or bistro. I'll lean towards the former but really was looking forward to the food.  Tried the Lamb Meatballs and Mussels as appetizer. Both fresh with nice flavours in a good quantity size. Definitely filling for sure. Main were Jerk Pork Tenderloin and Yogurt marinated Chicken kebob. Both were just okay. I tried really hard to like the pork but it was a little dry, and the sweet potato mash and kale were nothing special. One thing that surprised me was the mango sauce. Didn't go perfectly but was an interesting twist. The kebob was very middle of the road. Pretty much the same thing you can get at any shawarma or Greek fast food place. There wasn't a tzatziki sauce it was literally just plain yogurt.   Dessert was very meh as well both the cheesecake and banana bread pudding.   Not all bad though. Found out that they do BYOB wine Tuesday and Wednesday and on Monday all wine is half price which if you're looking for a place to drink a lot of wine this is good.   Overall, tried really hard to get excited and like this place based on the menu but it fell short of expectations which may have been higher than they needed to be.   A 3.0 out of 5.0 right on the nose all things considered."}
{"text":"We just discovered Aviv as a dining option before going to Tarragon. Honestly, it was fantastic!!!  The small plates all looked so good that we just decided to share, and every dish we had was great.  Then we discovered they had gluten free pizza, so we ordered a smoked chicken one, and it was great too.  We will definitely go back - and your Tarragon tickets get you a 10% discount. Oh, and the service was just excellent too!"}
{"text":"Loved the service. Our server was really accommodating and super cheerful. We ordered the veggie mezza platter with a range of standards (hummus, tahini, tabbouleh) and some special ones (butternut squash). I loved the butternut squash and the eggplant. The baba wasn't super smokey, which is great for me. This platter was yummy overall, but was super pricey and expensive imo - $18, but the plate was on the smaller side. More like a standard serving plate, when I was expecting more on a bigger plate.  Also got the Moroccan Lamb & Beef Kefta Meatballs. There were 3. The shakshuka (tomato based) sauce went very well with the meat, although the meatballs themselves were on the dry side. That I think made it fall between the fair and pricey range for $10. This is also where I loved our server btw - I had really wanted to get the kefta as a sandwich, but that was only available during lunch (we arrived at 4pm), so she gave us some extra homemade pita bread on the side so I could DIY my own. Points!  Really good homemade pita flat bread btw - a warm, homey smell with a nice crunch on the outside and doughy inside.  Overall, I'd come back again, but maybe during lunch time proper since the food I like and would get is cheaper during that period."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Very friendly staff and a great selection of pitas, salads and pizza. They also have an eclectic wine selection. Very fast with the food, but they don't pressure you in anyway to hurry up. They put water on your table and regularly fill it up. For a $12 lunch I felt like I was being waited on hand and food. Very flavorful chicken. Only challenge is parking, but it's right next to the subway (Dupont Station)."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Toronto and one of the reasons I came was to visit during Winterlicious. We have something similar in the States, so I was really looking forward to it.  When I narrowed my search to vegetarian, Aviv came up, so my friend and I decided to give it a try.  I opted for the quinoa and kale salad, which was absolutely exquisite!  I could tell the dressing was simply lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil, but the salad wasn't overly dressed and the combination of tangy and sweet was brilliant.  For the entree, I ordered the potato gnocchi which was accompanied by an assortment of veggies like snow peas, mushrooms, etc.  It, too, was quite good but just a bit heavy on the sauce.    1st gripe:  I will echo two comments made recently by the same Yelper, the first about the fruit crumble.  It was very lackluster--the fruit was not warm at all, the \"crisp\" was a shell of its former self as it had no bite or crispiness to it, and the fruit was not fresh.  Disappointing. My dinner companion opted for the tiramisu, which was good as tiramisu goes so I can't complain too much about that. (It wasn't even my dessert so how could I complain?)  2nd gripe:  The music was a mixture of hip hop, R&B, and pop--it seemed so out of place I actually said something to the person I came with.  It certainly took away from the mood of this quaint, rustic, and charming establishment.  While these two things did dull my experience a little, my overall experience was very good.  I'll definitely be back on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"This place was good. Came on a Saturday evening and it was pretty empty, so we were seated quickly. The place is modestly decorated and clean but the place lacked amiance. The service was great, my water cup was never empty!   We ordered the risotto balls (delicious! breaded and fried, but still soft, hot and tasty in the middle with risotto), the meatballs (okay, came with sauce and sliced grapes, a little too salty for my taste) and the cailmari (great! huge portion and nice and crispy, but a little cold by the time it came to the table)."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I was treated like FAMILY! The service was outstanding and the middle eastern food was pretty good! I had the whole salmon and it was probably one of the better ones I've eaten. The food is well priced and comes out quickly. Make sure you book a reservation on weekends because sometimes it can be quite busy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service. Little gem On Dupont. Who could imagine a place like this one?"}
{"text":"We went to Aviv for the first time tonight and had an awesome meal. We sat outside on the patio and order from their summerlicious menu. I got the rositto balls, chicken kebab, and chocolate cake. The rositto balls and kebab were delicious! I was also pleasently surprised with how large the main dish was. However, the chocolate cake was a bit dry for my liking. The staff were very nice and attentive. Overall we had a great experience and would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Solid quality. Attentive staff. Good prices.   And they didn't skimp on the alcohol in the cocktail either!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. I went during Winterlicious to celebrate my sons  birthday. The menu looked good but unfortunately the food did not come up to standard. It wasn't the worst meal I've had, but I doubt I'll go back. Staff were nice. Restaurant was not busy and they ran out of sweet potato fries. Really! Three stars are for effort."}
{"text":"The owner is very friendly and helpful.  We had to have a quick lunch so we can head back to work so we pre-ordered.  Frank made sure that our meals came in good timing.  Our first time here being Winterlicious.  Had the Risotto balls for starters and it was delicious.  Two balls but good size appetizer.  Very nice and light.  The main course was a fresh made pita with two (2) lamb/beef meatballs with sauce and a side of salad.  To be honest, when I first saw it, I was going to ask what happened to the rest of the meatballs because the pita looked so big compared to the meatballs resting in the middle.  BUT, it was the perfect amount since it came with tzatziki to dip the pita in as well.  All the flavours on the meatballs worked out very well together.  The salad was a mixed greens and was a nice side to have.   The dessert, I wasn't a fan of mine, apple strudel with ice cream.  I guess that's because my mom would make the best apple strudel.  But it was dessert, so I did eat it (a little more than half of it).  My co-workers had a blueberry cheesecake and a banana bread pudding which they book took to go and we tried it back in the office.  Very good!   LOVE the Israeli street signs.  Love the decorations around the place.  Its a pretty cute venue.  I would recommend for you to try it out."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant 3.5 out of 5, but rounded it to 4  I had visited Aviv Restaurant last year for a Yelp event, and there were several dishes at the event that I really enjoyed, one being the pancakes with bananas, so I made a mental note to return with my group (I run a food Meetup group) for brunch in the near future.  I contacted Robert, the manager at Aviv Restaurant over the summer and discussed with him the possibility of hosting a Meetup event at his restaurant. Initially I had made the reservation for 16 people, but the interest for this event was so high, that I increased the reservation to 22 people. Robert was incredibly accommodating and patient with the last minute changes I had to make.   The Good:  1) Robert responded to my messages quickly. He was also very professional and eager to please my guests and accommodate my requests.  2) Most of the food was delicious.  3) Good portions and good value for money.  4) I wanted to order a dish from the regular lunch menu, instead of the brunch menu, and Robert made it happen.  5) The restaurant had a jazz band come in to entertain the guests during brunch.  6) Gave my guests a glass of dessert wine at the end of the meal on the house.  7) My dish did not come with shrimps, only calamari, but received shrimps as an extra treat.  The Not So Good:  1) I had asked Robert if he could make mini pancakes like the ones we had at the Yelp event for my guests (I would pay for it), and he agreed to do it.  This never happened.  2) The reason I chose to order the salad from the lunch menu is because I love avocado and calamari. When I received my salad, it had calamari but was missing the avocado.  3) The jazz band was very distracting. My guests and I had to yell at each other in order to carry a conversation.  4) There was one waiter and one waitress, and the waiter did not seem to know what he was doing. He seemed so lost and confused. Even with the coffee refills; seems simple enough, but he had to be reminded to refill our cups many times.    5) The food took about an hour to come out.  All in all, we had a good experience at Aviv and would return if the kinks are ironed out."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had. Wish l lived closer so I could go back more often."}
{"text":"I liked it but was not overly impressed. I had the burger which was fine. The sea bass looked amazing and the mussels (which had secret meatballs in it, not sure if it was a mistake but good move !). My boyfriend loved his desert. I would say the service wasn't the best. It was pretty drafty so I had to put my coat on. They weren't dingy on the wine pour so I had respect for that.  I think I will need another visit. But based on my initial experience it was just OK. Also was very disappointed in the very limited menu choices. There were only about five items and then the only other choice was the winterlicious menu."}
{"text":"Great customer service !  Appreciate the friendly and prompt customer service at this location.  Definitely worth eating at."}
{"text":"Great food. Had the chicken kabab with pita bread. Very generous portions and great food. The sauces and veggies were so fresh. The kale and quinoa salad was also great. With the price as the helpings are huge. Would highly recommend Aviv. Service is exceptional as well."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after Casa Loma. We were the only ones in the restaurant. The manager was very attentive to our table. I ordered the pizza Marisa. It was very good and filling.   Overall, the food was really good but it seems to be more than Mediterranean cuisine on the menu.   It would be nice to see what the environment is at night."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and while food was decent, some of our issues were regarding service. Yes the staff are all friendly but the hiccups were 1) would have been nice if our table of 8 got  our food at, or at least close to the same time.  We were the only table there before crowds started so no excuse 2) its brunch, please come around to refill our coffee cups without having to ask or even trying to find someone 3) the latkes on the Yiddish Bennys were the tiniest latkes I have ever seen.  Could barely see them under the poached egg.  Also the menu seemed more limited than what was on their website.   Would have been great otherwise"}
{"text":"Great service! Tasty food! We arrived right before they were closing, starved and tired from sightseeing all day. We were greeted with a warm smile and open arms. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Bundle up, Dupont Street. It's time to go out for lunch, brunch, or dinner.   Aviv is an adorable subterranean Mediterranean restaurant that has been hiding out in The Annex for six months. It's time you go and find them.  They have an epic brunch menu, littered with scratch-made favourites and cocktail specials that I look forward to coming back and trying. You know what I'm more excited about trying? Their free BYOW on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Imagine. Free.   I was in here for lunch today and I enjoyed their grilled chicken sandwich piled high with fresh vegetables and bacon on their homemade whole wheat bread. I paired it with their salad (resolutions, y'all) that could have been a meal all on its own.   Some of the best service I've had in a long while. But else would you expect from the people that thought up free corkage nights?!    PEPPER POINTS: Imma say it again. They have free corkage on bring your own wine on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Free. And they're very close to an LCBO."}
