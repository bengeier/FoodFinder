{"text":"Great restaurant, excellent service.  It is such a relief to have a top restaurant out here in the 'burbs.  The staff all seem to like their jobs, which is a sign of good management."}
{"text":"Infusion was recommended by a friend so we decided to walk the 5 blocks or so to give it a try.  Staff was super friendly and apparently Friday they have a chef's 3 course menu if you are so inclined (plus you can order certain courses on their own if you would like).  I ordered the appetizer course from the chef's menu (escargot and mushrooms in a yorkshire pudding with a pepper gravy) and their spinach, mushroom, chicken fetuccine alfredo.  Both were quite delicious and the wine menu was quite decent as well.  Layout of the restaurant is a little odd, but we had a corner table that was fine.  I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Having dinner for the second time at Infusion. We had the vegetarian green curry and added shrimp. Delicious. Also they have the best gluten free penne carbonara I have tasted. Nice presentation. Friendly staff. Chef came by and talked to us. Can still smell the sprig of fresh rosemary. Nice relaxing jazz in the background. Will be back."}
{"text":"Decided to give Infusion a try after it had been open for a couple of months.  Four of us went, had a couple of appetizers, four mains and desserts.  Too be honest, I found the menu was confused, all over the place.  My wife had a thai salmon dish, it was a large portion, but it came with an odd breading, risotto was good.  I had the lasagna, not up to the standards of an italian restaurant and it wasn't  as hot as it should have been, nor was it a large portion for the price.  Friends had the special of the night and stuffed chicken breast, they were happier with their dish than ours.  The calamari appetizer was good, it also came with a different dipping sauce than I had tried before (almost a sweet thai). Desserts were very well done.  They are also pushing their signature cocktails, but they don't really fit in with the restaurant and the food; again I found it confusing. Atmosphere was also just okay.

For the price, I didn't leave overly happy for the quality. I wouldn't make this my first choice for a dinner.  The breakfast menu looks great so we might have to see if it's better for breakfast."}
{"text":"We dined at Infusion for the first time tonight, and it won't be our last. The food was absolutely perfect - delicious, perfectly cooked, well presented. I had the caprese salad to start and beef tenderloin as my main; they couldn't have been better, the beef beyond tender and the vegetables roasted just right. My husband had the beet salad and duck breast with foie gras off the chef's menu and said it was the best duck he's ever had. For dessert we shared a slice of wonderfully moist beet-chocolate cake; we were full enough from dinner - the servings were not small - that we couldn't manage a whole dessert each.
Being a quiet Monday night, there was only one waitress in the dining room, and she did a fine job. She was personable and friendly, attentive without hanging around too much. Service was prompt, and all our food and drinks arrived quickly.
Atmosphere was great, music playing quietly enough to encourage conversation.
It was a much more expensive meal than we usually treat ourselves to (we were celebrating an anniversary), but worth every penny.
Can't recommend highly enough. Dine here!"}
{"text":"Delicious gluten free options for both main course and desert! I choose a seafood pasta that wasn't listed as gluten free, but they were able to prepare that for me. Service was exceptional. The SW location isn't convenient for me, but I will cross the city to visit again."}
{"text":"Hmm I'm definitely in the middle when it comes to Infusion. I've eaten here a couple times. I was nervous about trying it initially as the past few tenants in this spot (Ochre Grill, a few pizza joints) were pretty awful. First off, the decor is quite lovely, they definitely did a good job with renovating the place. The service has been great both times I've been here, attentive without being overbearing. 
When we came for breakfast, I ordered the Canadian Bacon Eggs Benny, and my mother had the Salmon Eggs Benny. Both were really great, and I loved the chips and fruit that came with it. The fruit had a ginger taste to it that I quite liked, and the dill hollandaise on the Salmon Eggs Benny was really nice. The next time, I came for lunch. I had the Dijon Pulled Pork, and it was just ok. The bread it was on was burnt, and I couldn't really taste Dijon. The Duck Confit Club that my friend had was alright, but she said she couldn't really tell that it was duck. 
I would come back for breakfast, but lunch was not my favorite."}
{"text":"Every time we go out for dinner! We're always disappoint! Its really like being in Vegas! We enjoyed every time! Her favorite is muscles!"}
{"text":"We were impressed with the relaxed atmosphere of this restaurant yet the food was creatively tasty, prepared well and plated with style.   I knew that this restaurant was head chef owned by it atmosphere. It is about quality food at a fair price and delivering it with pleasant service.  As a Realtor and Foodie I will definitely introduce my clients who move to Evergreen or the deeper SW to this restaurant.   Nick Lima MaxWell South Star Realty."}
{"text":"Wow, totally unexpected. Steak was cooked to perfect. Wine list was small (I personally like) but the voices were fantastic. Definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"So disappointed tonight. After many visits with absolutely top notch food and spectacular service, tonight we got top notch food but the worst service we've had anywhere in the last 10 years. 20 minutes before the waitress even came to our table, didn't introduce herself, didn't ask if we wanted water, didn't pour our wine, slow, slow, slow. Finally asked for our bill and got out of there. Another older group of 4 we met outside were just as disappointed with her service as we were.
First time in memory that I left a 0 tip. The other waiter really looked after his tables. Not sure we will ever return after this experience. Too bad because we've really loved our past dining experiences at Infusion."}
{"text":"Just o.k
I admit the food was better then we thought it was going to be when we walked in. Filled with senior we were a little wondering. Although unhealthy, when the food arrived we felt better about our choice although I wouldn't say I would go back. This place seems confused about what it wants to be. It seemed like a combo between a Denny's and upscale contemporary. If they had a little guidance they could probably do a lot better for themselves."}
{"text":"I went here for a late lunch and was surprised to see how busy it was for a Saturday afternoon. I'm glad we called ahead!

To start, I was pleasantly surprised to see a diverse selection of vegetarian options on the menu. Normally I'm lucky to have more than one choice at a restaurant like this. I ended up going with the goat cheese and fig jam grilled cheese sandwich while my mom went with the vegetable sandwich and a side salad. 

Both of our sandwiches were excellent. Hers a bit messy but the server had warned us about it ahead of time. The presentation of the side salad was especially interesting; they used a thin piece of cucumber to make a \"bowl\" on the plate. Very cool (and tasty too!)

As for the service, our server was adorable! Super nice and friendly. She was helpful with suggestions and attentive without being overbearing or pushy. 

I would definitely like to come back here again. The breakfast and dinner menus both looked intriguing. I really want a chance to try their stuffed french toast!"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and great food. They care about vegetarian and gluten-free options, as well as about making people feel comfortable and welcome.

You are comfortable getting dressed up going for an anniversary,  or going in jeans and a shirt."}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the strip mall location. Once inside, you'll see that it's tasteful modern decor. But the best part is their brunch menu. I haven't tried their dinner and lunch options, but that's because their Brunch is so good and served until 4pm. Locally owned with a twist of uniqueness to their recipes. I recommend you go off the beaten path of restaurants to discover this gem."}
{"text":"this place is tucked into a deep south location, but worth the trek out there to sample the fare!

Why it's solid:

1. contemporary decor
2. a large, maybe too large a menu
3. gourmet options from various parts of the world
4. gluten free bread which tastes good, shocker!

interesting notes:

1. they have a decent booze selection
2. extended brunch hours
3. you can reserve tables
4. flat water is free!
5. small patio seating area for the summer"}
{"text":"First time here. My Monte Cristo sandwich and side salad were pretty good. I can only give this two stars due to the slow speed of service and the high prices for the food. The decor and ambiance are nice. 

Recommendation: Don't come to this restaurant hungry. You will starve waiting for your order! Lol!"}
{"text":"The brunch here is really good. There is a wide selection and the portion of the dishes is pretty big. They have a nice interior design as well. One thing i didn't like was they dont do split bills, they just divide the total by # of ppl, which is not a big deal for me most cases"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place, not because I'd ever tried any of the other place that had been located here (as many of the reviewers thus far had and it seems they were all bad) but rather I was hesitant because of the name. I wasn't sure what I was going to get myself into and lately I've been looking for comfort more then 'new'. 

But yesterday during our first 'snow storm' of 2014 we didn't want to travel far for brunch but with the rarity of no kids we wanted to treat ourselves. I looked up this restaurant here on yelp and found enough information about the food to try it.

First I must agree with all I read, our server was wonderful. Attentive but not over baring, even asking if I needed my apple cider warmed up incase it'd cooled to much (since id only been sipping it, mostly because it actually was so hot to start which I was happy with) 

Next the atmosphere is quite nice, bright, clean. Music at a nice level and busy but not loud, which is always a bonus in my books. 

My husband had a latte that he said was excellent and I had the hot apple cider which was nice, sweet so if you are wanting a more tart cider then this ones not it. 

We both decided on the traditional eggs benny. It came with some delicious homemade potatoe's and a little side of fresh fruit with a yogurt-ginger dollop on top. I enjoyed the fruit though my husband did not like the amount of juice in the bowl with the fruit. The eggs were cooked well and enjoyable. Though our only mutual thought was the eggs themselves seemed rather small compared to the meat and bread and their was not any big wow flavour from the sauce, meat, bread or the combination that would bring it above other places that we frequent for our Benny cravings. 

Overall great service, nice atmosphere and decent food. We would visit here again. 

Though i will note since we have 4 kids and a 5th on the way we asked about a kids menu and pricing and though they did not have a kids menu they had off menu options. Note, all options were $9.99/ea which in our family is a bit to much. So we'll visit during the rare days we have to ourselves and feel like staying close to our area of town."}
{"text":"Great flavors fresh generous portions and food with flair. Great value. 
I am a customer for years from Bragg Creek to Calgary. 
5 stars well deserved"}
{"text":"After a solid 12hrs of sleep (don't you just love those?), I woke up around 330pm, craving brunch ..... Yelp pointed me to this spot. 

Relaxed, upscale ambiance, with warm lighting and contemporary decor. Soft music paved my senses in the right direction for a good, solid brunch. 

Here's what i had:

- Green Kick Starter Smoothie (yogurt, spinach, kale, green apple and OJ) - definitely kick started me! Delicious and good nutrious start to the day. 

- Eggs Benedict with sautéed mushroom and leek, infused with truffle oil (all the ingredients shone through, especially the truffle oil - win.) 

- Chorizo sausage (decent, nothing to write home about, a bit too dry for my liking). 

- Thick-cut bacon (nothing great again, lacking flavor). 

I give this place 4 stars because the Chorizo sausage and the bacon were disappointing. The Eggs Benedict I had was good and worth trying for sure. Their cocktails look good! Trying that next time :-) 

Thank you for feeding me! :-)"}
{"text":"This place is one of my most favorite places to eat, I would give them 6 stars if I could!! If you are looking for a gourmet food experience this is the place. It's peaceful, clean and nicely decorated. We've always have lucked out and have gotten Heather as our server who makes you feel so special and well taken care of. I've had a couple different dishes here and they were all superb but my most favorite is the orange roughy dish, my god it's good!! They're Caesars are really delicious too, really zippy just the way I like them. Really, really good everything here!!"}
{"text":"I liked it well enough the first time that when one of my oldest friends wanted to go for lunch, we ended up here.  

Again, the food was excellent.  The lunch menu is built around sandwiches and wraps, often quite \"conventional\" looking, but always with an innovative twist. 

The atmosphere made it for me this time.  This isn't a large restaurant, but it is decorated in cool greys and whites and the choice of soft jazz for background music means that you can have a conversation without feeling as though you are competing with the music."}
{"text":"We were introduced to this place by my son for brunch. The Egg Benny were superb Service was great.Been back a few times for brunch.
I took my family out last week for dinner here and what a wonderful experience. The food was fantastic. We all tried a different dish and were amazed. We also each had dessert again we were blown away by the presentation and taste. I would recommend try the brunch and then for a special occassion dinner."}
{"text":"Food was good, especially the muscles for appetizer!  The lamp chop was delicious too!  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Having experienced various restaurants previously located in this unit- (Less than) Perfect Pizza, (Medi) Ochre Grill and, most recently, another terrible pizza joint, I confess to not having particularly high hopes when I saw that another restaurant was due to open there.

That was before I did a little research and discovered that Infusions was previously located in Bragg Creek and was pretty much washed away in the 2013 flooding, so owner/chef Air decided to relocate to Evergreen.

My wife and I went there this afternoon for brunch. On entering the restaurant it was immediately obvious that it had recently undergone an extensive refit- there was still a slight smell of paint in the air, but that will disappear soon. The washrooms are wheelchair-accessible and the gents has a baby-changing table (I assume the ladies does as well) which scores bonus points in my book. The restaurant advertises itself as child-friendly and I've seen plenty of parents with kids eating there at lunchtimes.

One thing I particularly like about the restaurant is that it's light and airy, rather than dark inside- unlike Earls, Ricky's, Phoenix Grill etc.

At time of visiting, the restaurant serves breakfast, brunch and lunch every day, but is only open in the evening at weekends- Friday through Sunday.

The food (lunch menu) looks fairly normal, but many items have an Asian (Thai?) flavour to them. The fish in my wife's seafood crepe, for example, had been poached in a saffron broth, and other items contain ingredients commonly seen in south-east Asian cooking.

I ordered meatloaf with fries, which I couldn't find any fault with at all- it was delicious.

Service is unhurried and relaxed, and our server was polite, helpful and charming. When we left she introduced the owner/chef to us who thanked us for coming, which was pleasant.

All in all it was a pleasant lunch in pleasant surroundings and reasonably priced. It's early days for Infusions in Evergreen, but if they maintain these standards I'll be happy to return. It certainly seems much better than any of its predecessors in the same unit, and I hope it's here to stay. This area could do with a classy restaurant and I hope it gets enough business to succeed here.

We've booked a table for dinner on Valentine's Day, so are looking forward to seeing what the dinner menu is like.

Update:

We went on the evening of Valentine's Day. There were two sittings at 17:30 and 20:30 and we chose the later one. The restaurant, as might be expected, was fully booked with couples and groups of all ages. There was a set menu with a choice of dishes for a three-course meal at $95 per couple plus drinks. Given the occasion we ordered bubbles, which came in the form of a rather delicious bottle of Cava.

Each course included at least one vegetarian dish which looked imaginative and tempting rather than the token gesture vegetarian options often seem to be. As neither of us is vegetarian we didn't order those though.

My wife started with a beet, arugula and goat cheese salad while I had lobster bisque. The beets were cut into heart shapes for Valentine's Day which I thought was nice attention to detail. The lobster bisque was excellent; tasting strongly of lobster rather than salt- a problem I've frequently encountered elsewhere with this and similar seafood dishes. This one was spot-on.

Main courses were Roast Prime Rib with Yorkshire Pudding, truffle-scented bacon mashed potatoes and a reduction (my wife) and pan-seared cherry and orange-glazed duck breast with mushroom risotto and asparagus (mine)

I was pleased to see that the entrées arrived on heated plates- the number of places which don't follow this basic, simple rule is staggering- so wouldn't cool too quickly as we ate. Again both dishes were absolutely delicious. My duck breast was cooked to perfection and very tender; and the accompaniments complimented each other well. My wife assures me that the prime rib was every bit as good too- and that the potatoes were particularly good.

Dessert was (for my wife) a strawberry shortcake- so good I didn't get to try it at all- while I had the chocolate terrine. Each layer was a different colour of chocolate flavoured with a different liqueur. It had an intense flavour- (as does the tiramisu I've previously enjoyed there)- and was very good indeed.

Overall we both enjoyed an excellent meal with a decent bottle of wine at a reasonable price; we left contentedly full and satisfied rather than feeling bloated and reaching for the antacid when we got home.

Service was efficient and friendly but unhurried. At no time did we feel that we were being rushed- no dishes arriving at the table before we had finished the previous course.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to enjoy a really good meal in pleasant, relaxed surroundings- and not only those living in SW Calgary. We'll definitely return for an evening meal from the regular menu."}
