{"text":"The icy weather was partially responsible for our choice of this restaurant but we were also wanting to try something new in our neighbourhood. The staff were welcoming and greeted us with warmth and a smiley \"Happy New Year.\" I ordered the lamb pasta. Homemade flat pasta with a tasteless minced lamb sauce. I added salt. The seafood pasta had broken clam shells throughout which made chewing very awkward. Service was good. Not sure we will revisit this restaurant."}
{"text":"We went on a Valentine's Day, and thus was offered a special menu.  It was a four course meal, and we appreciated the pace of the serving.  Our appetizers were not as warm as we had hoped (crab cakes), but the remainder of the meal was delicious.    We did order a beer, but that was forgotten throughout the meal.  We did not inquire about it, nor was it charged on our bill - not a big issue for us.  The atmosphere is very private, and we enjoyed the noise level around us.  Overall, we had a good dinner.  We would like to return to try items from the regular menu in the near future."}
{"text":"I love the look and feel of this restaurant! When you first walk in they take your coats for you and greet you with a smile. When you look around you can see lots of art work and decor that makes you feel like you're in Amalfi Coast Italy! They also play great music that gives you the good feel vibes. It feels like a classy, but casual spot you can have drinks and dinner. They also have s private room  they can close off for parties or functions.  We ordered the the 10 oz steak and also the scallop and shrimp pasta. Both dishes were fantastic ! I know it's not a steakhouse here but the steak was better than most steak houses we've been too.   The staff were also very friendly and attentive. They were also knowledgeable about the food they serve in the menu and had great recommendations.   We would def come back !"}
{"text":"The meal started off with promise, the bread in the bread basket and bruschetta were both excellent. However, the rest of the meal was a different story. The waiter was very unhelpful, argumentative and had little to no knowledge about the food on the menu. When we mentioned a dairy allergy, she indicated that all pasta noodles contain milk (it does not) - when we tried to correct her she continued to argue with us, before finally agreeing to check (their pasta noodles contains no milk btw) little did we realize that this was only the beginning... One member of our group ordered a pasta with rose sauce, yet when the server brought it out she said \"oh this isn't rose sauce,\" but continued to serve it anyway, only removing it after we said that she did want rose and not tomato sauce. As she served the meals she also gave everyone the wrong dish.  Another member from our group ordered a dish listed as a shell pasta dish, when it came out it was a penne, which she told us earlier was the only pasta that is not homemade. When we mentioned it to the server she argued with us, indicating that the menu was incorrect but that we should have somehow known it was penne. At this point we asked for the manager, the waiter stood at the table as we spoke to him (how awkward) The manager also began arguing with us, and said that penne is a shell pasta. He was condescending and rude and was yelling at us. For fun after we left we looked it up on-line and there is no reference anywhere that indicates that penne is a shell pasta. If the owner or waiter reads this please note that penne is a tube pasta. Shell pastas look like... shells... But even if you go to this restaurant and have no issues with a waiter who has absolutely no knowledge of the food or a manager who starts to yell at you because you don't think penne is a shell pasta, you will surely be disappointed with the food. The pastas were all below mediocre. It's what I imagine a pasta dish ordered at pizza pizza would taste like... The pesto and rose sauce were more like bowls of oily creamy soup with a few noodles and the pasta with lamb tasted like a bottle of ragu meat sauce...  the shell pasta that never came out with shells was also unsatisfactory. There were three people at the table who actually work as waiters elsewhere and were shocked at the level of service encountered here. There are very few good Italian restaurants in Thornhill and with the opening of this one, nothing has changed."}
{"text":"Don't listen to the negative reviews    Fantastic , friendly staff  Lia the manager is very gracious and accommodating and our server Martin  Was very knowledgeable in the menu selection and  His dessert suggestion was absolutely fantastic.   The deep fried Calamari is out of this world. The batter they use is just superb.  This coming from a Sicilian who is very particular On seafood.  It was palatable and very delicious, not rubbery as I find with most calamari.  My wife had Scialatielli allo stile amalfatana  - very delicious pasta with shrimps and scallops in a creamy vodka rose sauce with tomatoes grown in volcanic soil - very impressive taste !!   The food is out of this world - try the fileto di manzo That's what I had  , I will post a picture of it later  Nice hunk of AAA Black Angus on a bed of Vegs - potatoes- and drizzled with mushroom cognac sauce.  This main is a great value for the money (38) We went on  a groupon gift , so we didn't pay full fare but the week prior I visited Ruth Chris and the $140 steak I had there , does not compare with the item - absolutely superb !! - my compliments to the chef !!  Service was great - water glasses always filled  (My wife is a water drinker )   I had rye (crown) and coke and the drinks were spot on - not drowned with soda.  Great atmosphere- and to top it off - the desert is to die for  Total bill (3 course meal) for 2 with a couple of drinks - $184 Groupon gift was a $140 value  My bill was 44 dollars - I left 70 bucks because the service  was great - food was out of this world -         Definitely going back and will recommend to all"}
{"text":"Wow! What a gem!  Went there for lunch and after the tasty bread and dippings, had the soup of the day; a flavourful asparagus soup. So fresh! Who knew asparagus could be so filling?  Shared the broad pasta in lamb ragu, generously sprinkled with sweet peas.  Helped it go down with the ruby red Syrah by the glass. First time in a long time that by the glass wine was actually good.  Too full for dessert, we topped it off with a steaming hot, properly layered latte.   Our waitress was sweet as could be, and made sure we were well looked after.  Go there, but don't tell too many other people or it might get too popular and there won't be room for us."}
{"text":"We went out for family dinner in thornhill and our first stop was Mezzo Note. But since they didn't take us without reservation we came to the new place and were glad we did. This new gem in the heart of Thornhill is a must see and taste. Great restaurant, operating only few month. Staff is very nice and very efficient. Food was delicious. We ordered bruscetta and grilled calmari for appetizers. They were really good and so was our main. We will def be back!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing Italian restaurant. Service is fantastic with friendly waitron that are attentive but not overbearing. I had the carpaccio as a starter and Veal in White Wine sauce for mains. Both were flavourful and totally delicious. The evening was rounded off by a creamy and punchy tiramisu that melted in the mouth. I will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to eat on Fathers day and ended up here as this establishment  was the only one available to accommodate us on such short notice. Upon arrival the place looked amazing. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and manager then shown to our table. Waiter arrived right away telling us the specials. We ordered a bottle of sparkling water to start as we were still looking over the menu. When it came to place our order we started with the bruschetta (which was partially cut and just made a mess after we fully cut it ourselves. So request it to be cut fully in the kitchen) and the calamari which were just to  perfectly breaded to be made in house. I will say that both tasted good. Mains arrived at a perfect time as we noticed the place started getting full and service started to dwindle and fall apart. Our waiter was no where to be found and the bus boy filled our water glasses with regular water when we had sparkling in it. Even the manager almost did the same thing. Please use different glasses in the future. Parpadelle with lamb looked dry and needed to be tossed with olive before serving to give it a nice shine. Spaghetti with sundried tomatoes was ok as not a fan of Pecorino Romano. Scialatielle Amalfitana was the only pasta dish that tasted good. The Salmone was cooked perfectly but the rapini was just to overcooked for my liking. Decided to skip dessert as we lost our appetite when we saw two customers waiting for a table dressed in running attire, Adidas muscle T and sandals. Most of the clientele was either dressed sharp or casual. Maybe change your name to Amalfi Coast Cafe. The final kicker to my best Father's Day ever was when we paid for the bill and the waiter gave us all twenty dollar bills so we were forced to give 20%. My hat goes out to such a smart move."}
{"text":"This restaurant took the place of MidEastro in Thornhill. In a strip mall, the inside is the opposite of the outside. High ceilings, classic decor and beautiful black and white photo murals in places. There is a large private room. Hints of neon are a strange design choice.  Last night when we went there was a function going on in the private room, and only five tables full outside of the private room. We weren't terribly hungry and so had a fairly simple order. They did bring lots of Ace bread to fill the gap, but it should not have taken 45 minutes for food to arrive. The time delays were a deciding factor in not having dessert. 2/5 on timing and communication.  The food itself was very good, 4/5: Burrata with prosciutto for my child. The Italian burrata was so amazing that she did not share the cheese. She willingly parted with the arugula salad on the side. They forgot to bring my daughter's garlic bread and so we told them to just cancel it half way through the meal. Pasta with shrimp and scallops was a perfect size and really great fresh noodles. I appreciated that they removed the tails from the shrimp The seafood platter came with a half portion of salmon, half portion of halibut and one grilled shrimp. Delicious, but perhaps a couple more shrimp would have rounded this out nicely for $32.  It is the kind of place on a regular day when hungry where you would order 2-3 courses, making it a more expensive dinner out. For example, a woman at a nearby table started with a pizza and then ate a pasta dish. I don't know if she also had dessert. Her companion ate likewise."}
{"text":"Absolutely great experience at Amalfi Coast! Hosted a birthday party here for 21 people (mix of adults and kids) and everything went great. The party room was already booked but it was no issue - they were able to close off the front part of the restaurant for us and it worked great. Spoke to Lia over email and phone and then came in to finalize and she was great to deal with - knows her stuff and makes great recommendations. We did a family style meal and it was awesome - lots of great food and our guests loved it. We had fried calamari, grilled veg, margarita pizza (mix of regular and charcoal dough), warm mushroom salad to start and everything was delicious and came out together and on time. We then had the seafood pasta (the one with scallops and shrimp), spinach gnocchi, fish, lamb chops, and veal scallopini, and it also came with platters of potato and veg (rapini and cabbage), and parm fries - everything was delicious, our guests loved each dish. The lamb chops were cooked perfectly, the veal was tender, the parm fries were a huge hit (their fries are delicious by the way - no one could stop eating them and the kids said they are the best they've had - even better than McDonald's lol)  We then had teas/coffees/etc and were able to bring our own cake, which is always appreciated.  Service from Danielle was also great - very friendly and happy to assist and serve  The chef, Giussepe, is great too - true Italian I will definitely be back and I would definitely recommend it for a party or just a dinner. Really good experience."}
{"text":"Wow.. Wow.. wow.. who knew this Italian restaurant was hidden in the  Bathurst and New Westminster plaza! Amalfi is a hidden gem, and I am so happy I found it. Choosing where to go for dinner with friends on a Saturday night is always a struggle, especially when you don't want to trek downtown- so me and gal pals decided to give it a shot. Upon arrival we were greeted right away and offered for our coats to be hung up. (this never happens at a restaurant in Thornhill).   Right away I was surprised by the ambience, the full bar with the lights was such a classy touch. The bar was busy with groups of people waiting for a free table, so just a note: MAKE A RESERVATION!   Our waitress Danielle showed up right away with water  and bread w/ olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I will be honest.. the bread was nothing fancy.. but trust me you wont want to fill up on the bread because the food is BEYOND DELICIOUS!  My friends and I did not know what to order because there were so many options, so we decided to order a bunch of dishes and just shared!  We started with 3 Apps: Caesar Salad, which was fresh crisp lettuce lightly, dressed in a delicious (not too garlicky) dressing. The best part was the TWO HUGE pieces of pancetta- most places only serve 1.   The Charcoal Pizza was by far the COOLEST dish, it is a must try and basically an amazing photo opportunity for all you instagrammers. The crust had so much flavor!  Last.. .the STAR of the night was Ostrica Fungo Grantinati aka.. a delicious plate of mushrooms, cheese and greens. This can be a meal it itself between the fresh green salad and the pile of mushrooms, this plate was way too good to be true.   For the mains we got 2 pasta dishes and the lamb chops.  The lamp chop presentation was so flawless; I didn't want to eat it. But.. I did and I enjoyed every bite. 4 good-sized lamb chops with potatoes and veggies!  Both pasta dishes had huge pieces of seafood in every bite , the ratio of sauce to noodles was on point. Did I mention the noodles are HOME MADE.. In house! You can tell a difference, by far best pasta in Thornhill!   We did not have room for dessert but Lia (the manager) came over and told us that we HAD to try the lemon dessert, which Amalfi is famous for. It was super light and refreshing!   5 stars for this hidden gem, I cannot wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"What a great gem in Thornhill! Delicious authentic Italian food from start to finish. The restaurant is spacious with a modern decor, and there is a private room at the back which is great for parties and events  For our visit, we had: Caprese - The bocconcini di bufala was amazing, as was the vine riped tomatoes  Carpaccio Di Manzo - great starter as well. My companion doesn't usually eat anything raw but she liked this!  Bosco Pizza (mozzarella, pancetta, cremini mushrooms, truffle oil and parsley) - simply delicious and I loved the fact that it's densely packed with toppings. The crust on the pizza was amazing!  Pappardelle alla Boscaiola (egg noodles with wild mushrooms and lamb ragu) - great meat sauce on this one, and the pasta was cooked perfectly  Scialateilli allo stile Amalfitana - a nice seafood pasta with a pasta that is unique to the Amalfi coast (nice chew and thickness to it!)   Gnocchi Verde - Spinach based gnocchi with gongozola cream and pistacchio. Absolutely deliciocus! I would say this is a must get!  Scottadito alla romana - Lamb chops that are presented nicely on a wooden board, with rapini, potatoes and fried onions. Great portion size on this one!  All the pasta and pizzas are made fresh in-house and I could really taste the difference. Service was friendly thoroughtout the night and at a pace that we didn't feel rushed.   Overall we really enjoyed our visit and would not hesitate to recommend this place for anyone looking to dine in the Thornhill area."}
