{"text":"UPDATE:  This establishment has since gone out of business.  =======  We've been looking for quite some time for a cute coffee house in the area, where we can sit at a table with a nice foamy latte and just READ and RELAX.  The day we chose to enter WesTown Grind, we stumbled upon a tea tasting event, so it wasn't exactly the experience we were craving.  The place is definitely cute, but small -- so although we weren't in with the tasting group, it still felt a little like we were participating.  But what a cool event to host!  And I heard the owner and his colleague say they're going to try to do a lot more events like it to support other local businesses.  Classy.  Now, for the coffee...!  The Irish Nut Job I ordered was freaking delicious.  The cup was much bigger than I expected for a regular.  The hell with your inevitable reminders about volume and container shape.  This was a good-sized cup of joe, even if it was all in my head (but I don't think it was).  And the coffee was so good I forgot to savor it.  I had downed it all in about 15 minutes.  I probably would have ordered another if we hadn't had other plans that night.  WesTown serves sandwiches and paninis, too, so we're going back this weekend to try them, and to hopefully get some good reading time in.  But even if we get distracted again, I know I'll at least get me some prime coffee time.  UPDATE 4/2/11: Went back for sandwiches.  I ordered the Caprese, which is basically just slices of fresh mozzarella and tomato with a pesto spread.  Pretty good!  Don't expect to be completely blown away, but it was nice to have the option of adding a freshly made sandwich with fresh ingredients to go with my specialty latte (Banana Cream Pie -- delish)."}
{"text":"Really filling, really delicious pressed sandwiches (the Caprese ...mmm... was amazing in both taste & quality).  GRIND of course has gourmet coffee made how you want it (with lots of suggestions too; good for someone like me who doesn't know what a triple-thisiatto with halfcaf hold the other thingamajig is).  Convenient location (3 blocks from the I-90 exit).  A warm, relaxing atmosphere.  The owner is super-cool & easy to talk to.  It's a great place to pop into for a lunch break with a friend (you can order ahead too) or sink into over an afternoon/evening of sipping & munching while reading."}
{"text":"Tasty food - YUM! Good coffees/selection. Nice, relaxed atmosphere and a friendly owner and staff."}
{"text":"Some of the best coffee you can find in Cleveland--the standard mocha is the best I've ever had.  The sandwiches have been a great addition, try the caprese!"}
{"text":"A lot of folks associate West Park with only the restaurants, bars and businesses in Kamms. While they are awesome too, many people are missing out on some of the best local eateries in town by not venturing to the eastern end of WP.  Joining the already fabulous lineup of places such as Caffe Roma, Der Braumeister, Nablus, Sahara, Luchitas...(I can go on...) is WesTown Grind Caffe. Small, quaint, friendly...and WOW! The COFFEE! It's about time this little neck of the West Park woods was treated to a local and authentic coffee shop, and The Grind has filled that void! Not only is the coffee great, but with the recently introduced sandwich menu, its a must stop for the lunchtime quick pick me up, or late night study session.  In fact, the peanut butter banana nutella HEAVEN was so delish, that we decided to book The Grind as the supplier for our weekend ski club bus trip in February! (and the owner was more than happy to help customize our orders too!) And there's something about a place that serves mom's meatballs and tiramisu that just warms your soul, you know?  Still the newbie on that block, The Grind will for sure be here for the long haul. (Coffee and Cupcake pairing event?! SO. WISH. I could attend...and can't wait for the next one!) They just have that....special touch :)  Keep it up WesTown Grind! And welcome to the neighborhood!"}
