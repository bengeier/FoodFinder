{"text":"This was the most horrible experience ever. These guys are absolute cheaters. I ordered for delivery late at night. I ordered Chicken Kadai and Rooti and they sent me Butter chicken and garlic naan. If you are aware of INDIAN food butter chicken is never made fresh they make a big pot and serve it for a day or two however chicken Kadai/karai at most places are made fresh. They probably had lots of butter chicken left so to get rid of it, they sent it to me probably thought it was some white person wouldn't know the difference but I am from South Asia so eat that shit everyday and make it as well. When I called them the guy lied to me and said oh that's how we make our chicken kardai/Karai then I started speaking to him in Hindi then he goes oh sorry next time I'll send you a free karai we didn't know it was for you. Do yourself a favour and don't order from these cheaters. I'd rather order from Merchi or another good Resturant."}
{"text":"My Hubs and I are really interested in trying new and different venues in town to mix it up a bit and we received a mailer from A Perfect Pizza and thought we would try it out. First, I have to say I am a stickler for grammar and punctuation so I was immediately turned off by the 11 obvious errors throughout the flyer. If you are going to publish something and mail it to 50,000 people, make sure it's edited! (And hopefully you don't have this same brochure published in the other markets you are in.) Ok, so that is just getting picky!  More importantly, let's discuss the food and service... We had a great experience ordering over the phone (no web site to order from), the guy was nice and we had no problem. They said 30-45 min for delivery so when it showed up 70 min later we were a little disappointed, crossing our fingers that our pizza hadn't sat in the back of a car forever. We don't mind waiting, if it's going to be over an hour, tell us it will be over an hour- then at least we won't already be mad when it arrives. Set the customers expectations to start and you should be ok.  The pizza... NOT \"A Perfect Pizza\". Unfortunately when we opened the box, the pizza was slightly crushed (these things happen), but the pizza looked~ sad. The vegetables had a slight brown tinge to them, the pizza was flat and the cheese looked cheap. Once we dug in, with some hesitation, we found the crust was doughy and slightly raw in the center.   I don't know if there has ever been a pizza that my hubs and I have ever walked away from until this day. We got a \"special\" that included 4 cans of soda, too bad it was the most expensive pop we have ever bought because the pizza was inedible.   The best thing about this place is that they say they donate 2% of sales to the Humane Society which is why I give them a star at all."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent. Wings are typically over cooked. Delivery to new local areas hit and miss. Ordered from here half a dozen times. The last time delivery took 1 hour and 45 minute so the pizza and wings were cold and the 2L of coke was missing. Found out from delivery driver it wasn't even put on the order ticket. Driver seemed apologetic and offered to drive back the missing coke. Since the order took so long, I wasn't going I leave a tip but since the driver offered to drive back to base (base is literally blocks away) to get coke and drive back, I spotted him 5 bucks. Big mistake. The driver took the money and ran. Never did come back. FML"}
{"text":"I know that this review will differ greatly from prior reviews. Perhaps the cook is different, or maybe it is the East Indian menu items that I was told were added about six months ago, but my family had two perfect pizzas there two days ago.  One was a butter chicken pizza and the other was a kebab with butter chicken sauce without the chicken that we requested.  The ingredients and the dough were great quality, although I preferred the chicken tandoori pieces on the butter chicken pieces.  However, what made the pizzas really stand out was the chicken korma sauce we poured on the pizza. We ordered the chicken korma separately, and opted for the spicy option, which we were told meant that there were spices in the sauce such as coriander, cumin, etc...- not that the sauce is hot - and it was delicious on the perfectly cooked fresh nan and on the pizza.  We were also told that, depending on personnel, it might be possible for the pizzas to be on nan instead of regular dough and to have korma sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Well I went there a couple of times. Thought oh my gosh it's so thick and it's cheap. But now I know why it's cheap. I've threw up twice. Then decided to take a look at what's inside this pizza. Never seen a more undercooked pizza in my life. The wings the overlooked and fell apart as you touch them. Then they are also located at the worst place to have a restaurant in airdrie."}
{"text":"The pizza was gluey and flavourless. The delivery took over an hour. Not impressed. there are much better pizza places in airdrie.  Avoid"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a find... drive by all the time but never stop.  Was wanting something quick but different for supper... lamb biriyani.... amazing !  And affordable!! Also great gentlemen behind the counter who is very proud of his business... and it shows in quality and taste of the food!!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I were quite hungry this evening and did not feel like going out for a bite. Didn't even feel like picking up anything.   We found Perfect Pizza and checked their menu - they have a two-for-one lasagna! And it was super reasonable at $18.99 for the two with garlic toast AND two cans of pop! Whoa!!   So, we had to order. The guy came and he was friendly, told us that they had just opened up a couple months ago.   We dug into our lasagnas and the lasagnas were awesome!! Here's the thing - to order a lasagna from a pizza place that has such a variety of items on their menu you would think that it would be ok but this was great!   Kudos to them! We are looking forward to trying their other items."}
{"text":"Great place to order pizza for the family or a large group. Prices are cheap and the pizza is yummy. The crust isn't thin or thick, but more medium with a proportional amount of toppings. I like the two for one deals, hot wings and my favourite - the butter chicken pizza. I plan to try the tandoori chicken pizza with paneer next, as well as the lasagna. I am also keen to try their Indian food.  This place delivers but there is also a free parking lot if you want to pick up your order. This place is right next to the Saddledome and it gets really busy before and after the game."}
{"text":"i am shocked to see the much older previous negative reviews. Perhaps they are under new management or have improved their ways because our experience has always been really great. In the past 6 months we have ordered pizza once and east Indian food three times. I think their Indian food is so delicious, and the service has been great. I have had lots of good Indian food, but for reasonably priced delivery, with a great quality product, this place scores high for us. The Pizza was good, thicker crust and heavier than what I personally enjoy in a pizza, but in all honesty I enjoyed the Indian food the best. Not to say the pizza was bad, it was good, I just like a thinner more crunchy crust. My only  criticism would be the hot saucy food in plastic containers, however I am guessing you are limited with options for hot saucy delivery food containers. Maybe even tin or paper boxes would be better options, but likely less cost efficient. Hot plastic can leech chemicals, that is not to say yours do, but I just prefer to avoid that all together. We have tried most of your Indian food menu, and every dish was delish! Best Indian Food in Airdrie we have had."}
{"text":"We were craving for some pizza while in Calgary during the stampede and found this place. The pizza is seriously awesome and the price is amazing! Would recomend it to all. The staff is extremely friendly and the place is clean. It's located right outside the main entrance of the stampede."}
{"text":"Great price for delicious pizza close to Stampede grounds. We called in the order for pick up on a busy Friday night. Owner said 25 min, we show up and he realized he didn't make the order since it was so busy and he was short staffed that night. He quickly made our pizza and discounted our chicken Caesar salad (worth $10). Super nice guy who was running non stop by himself all night. Awesome pizza! (Don't bother with panago or Domino's crap)"}
{"text":"ORDER HERE ALL THE TIME. Love this pizza. I'm from a small town and anyone that understands THAT'S PIZZA, go go go to this place. Best pizza in the city hands down. Great topping amounts, not cheap like most other spots you can order from. The cheese bread is amazing. Staff is very friendly, they are very very nice. This place is my go to pizza place in the city!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim and so happy I did! I ordered from their lunch menu - I can't remember the name of the dish but it was two meat and one veg (chicken and lamb) with rice and naan. Wow!!! Delicious! Only $11 and serving size was huge! Clean kitchen and super-friendly service!!!!! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Yelp reviews are bad.   Tried the so called lasagna. Tasted terrible and was not a real lasagna from a traditional sense. The pizza was ok but nothing to write home about.   Some girl on yelp posted about the korma and it sucked. Nothing interesting and not the created by any measure.   Pizza cheese bread uninteresting and the garlic sauce is unappealing.   Overall would avoid unless you want pizza."}
{"text":"I was not expecting the amazing Indian food for a place called a perfect pizza. We had the chicken vindaloo and the tandoori mixed meat it was it was wonderful. Want to go again and try the donar"}
{"text":"Food was awful ! Haven't tasted anything so tasteless ever ! I would have been better eating cardboard and cheaper too!!!! Awful"}
{"text":"Wow.. I've found my new donair pizza spot in Calgary!  A Perfect Pizza is a family run business that prides itself in good quality food at a low price.  They have regular pizzas but what puts them above others is their Indian menu.  They have a substantial selection of East Indian dishes to go or, have inside (5-6 regular sized tables).  We ordered the butter chicken pizza and donair pizza.  Two large pizzas for $35, not a bad deal!  Tip: If you like your pizza crust with a bit more crunch then let them know and they'll be happy to do it for you!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while visiting Calgary last month. Ordered samosas with malai kofta. Samosas were great, but it's the malai kofta that had me wanting to write this review!  Hands down the BEST malai kofta I have ever had, and I've had quite a bit! The place is clean, the staff is super friendly and the food is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  I would've never imagined such good food from a pizza joint. This restaurant alone will make me come back to Calgary!  If I could rate it higher than 5 stars, I would!"}
