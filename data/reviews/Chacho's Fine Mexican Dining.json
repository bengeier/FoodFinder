{"text":"I come here for lunch regularly. Great food friendly service. Worked near it for a year without noticing the restaurant but very glad that I did."}
{"text":"Fantastic obscure small place. Decor is eclectic and casual. Food is deliciously fresh! Guac and chips were awesome, fish tacos were amazing, pork ribs fantastic. Portions are good. The lone waitress handling all the tables was friendly, cheery and competent in spite of her obvious busyness. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Chacho's is the definition of a \"hidden gem.\" For those who know and appreciate authentic Mexican food, this is the best spot in the city. Delicious tacos (chorizo, al pastor and tinga), a great Mexican beer selection and an ambience that makes you feel like your in Mexico."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food. I recommend it Tiene el sabor real a la comida mexicana, muy recomendable!!!!"}
{"text":"- Nice Place. - Good service. - Very expensive compared with other Mexican restaurants. - The food (tacos) were far from being tasty compared with the typical tacos you will find in Mexico City."}
{"text":"Very good food, chili relleno was delicious! The place is a little ways off any public transport - but a good 10 min walk is exactly what you need after a nice mexican meal."}
{"text":"I have been searching for great Mexican food in Toronto and this has been the best so far.  I loved the Pesole blanco and the home made sausage tacos were fantastic.   The hot sauce available on the side was wicked hot.  The churls are to die for.   I liked the restaurant itself as it is spacious and less claustrophobic than some of the downtown restaurants.  The waitress was lovely and gracious."}
{"text":"What a great and very reasonably priced lunch! The chicken mole was especially delicious, and we appreciated the selection of non-alcoholic Mexican cocktails. Jesus, the owner, cook and waiter, was friendly and attentive. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So good!!!   I am pretty familiar with a wide range of different foods, but Mexican food is one that eludes me. All I ever associate Mexican food with is tacos. And then I think \"well I've got an Old El Paso kit at home....\"   But this place is tucked away on a side street midtown, and such a hidden little gem. Great date night spot if you want somewhere quieter, with no hipster line-ups, and snooty staff.   For drinks, I got a delicious strawberry margarita and my boyfriend got a Paloma (tequila and Mexican grapefruit pop) which he loved! Later, we ordered some shots of tequila to sip too (yes, good tequila is so very sippable!).   For food, we shared an order of:   1) Guacamole with freshly fried chips (which they refilled once, and were AMAZING)  2) Pork tacos (really, really good -- simple, and allowed the pork flavours to shine)   3) A tamale (which was meh.) I mostly got it cause it reminded me of a Chinese zongzi.   The guacamole is some of the best I've ever had. It tastes like it was made on the spot. It was a huge portion and so glad the chip basket was refilled! Would definitely come back again for another Mexican craving :)"}
{"text":"I hope that my experience was an anomaly.   The overall experience and the food were far less than memorable. I wanted to like it because I live nearby but the refried beans were more like re-nuked beans and the nuked enchiladas were wanting for flavour. Unlike most every other Mexican restaurant we've been to you don't get complimentary chips and salsa while you wait--that used to be a given. The food arrived cold and my plate was promptly taken back to the kitchen to get re-nuked yet again. They claim to be Mexican \"Fine\" dining--well, do you know what a hyperbole is? Say no more. Way over priced for the quality of experience and food in my opinion.  I recommend you try it on your own in the hope that I just had bad luck. That said, I won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I like how the food is authentic and one of my favourite dishes is their ceviche. I also had the steak burrito- though I really like the flavours I feel that it is pricey for the amount of food that you get especially for the quacamole.   I haven't eaten here in a while. Maybe I will give it another chance."}
{"text":"Was there on a Wednesday night.  We were the first ones in, and the last ones out. By choice. The atmosphere is nice, relaxing. We had wine and the guacamole to start. It was fantastic! We opted for the special, which was pork ribs in a mole sauce. They were so good. Meat fell off the bone. Also ordered the fish tacos, which were the best I've ever had!! Highly recommend.  You could tell the other patrons were locals. Some were impatient at the amount of time it took for the food to arrive. Personally, it wasn't too long, and good, scratch cooked food takes longer than a fast food joint. Was worth the wait. Those who are looking for a half hour dining experience should order take out!  Service was good, food was fantastic, will be going again and again."}
{"text":"I've had take out from chaco's several times and I don't think I'll return. The food is quite tasty,  when you get it. Twice in a row I've ordered food here and not received my full order.   The first time I received the enchiladas without the beans and the tortilla soup without any avocado. I called and let them know, hoping they'd sort out the error in future.   Less than a week later I order about $50 worth of food. Enchiladas, the parrillada and the tortilla soup. This time the enchiladas were missing all the sides. Rice, beans and salad. The parrillada was missing the tortillas.   I had checked the order to be sure, so I returned and informed them of the missing food. I'm met with an apology and a statement that it doesn't come with salad. I tell them it's on their website. She asks me to show her,  and actually brings my cell phone into the kitchen to show the chef. Unbelievable.   I wait a further 15 mins for some salad, rice,  beans and tortillas. In total it took over an hour to get my food. When I return I realize that they forgot the rice again. The food is quite expensive and takes an extremely long time for what I  must call the most consistently bad service I've ever received in Toronto.   I would like this restaurant to succeed as the area needs it, but the current management is beyond a joke."}
{"text":"It's so nice to find a place so close to home that I can walk there.  My daughter and I went to grab a quick bite last weekend and we were pleasantly surprised.  This place is very authentic Mexican.  I have been to Mexico a few times and most places there cater to tourists so it's never the real deal.  Here it is different and real and literally 5 minutes away from home.  We had the guacamole to start which was freshly prepared and it was really good.  I like that it had chunkiness to it and it wasn't a smooth paste like some places.  We ordered some tacos, I had the chicken she had the beef.  Finished the meal off with their flan, yumm.  The service was very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Had high hopes based on the reviews on here.. But sadly we were a bit disappointed with the lack of flavour in our dishes. It was quite a bland meal :(  On the positive side - the service was excellent and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"I echo all of the positive (4 and 5 stars) reviews written before mine.   They have Tecate and Negro Modelo in bottles in addition to Corona, Dos Equis etc. Served ice cold. Nice.   The food is authentic Mexican, made from scratch, and absolutely delicious.   The atmosphere is warm and friendly, with some nice on-theme decor, although the building they're in is decidedly un-fancy. Don't judge the book by its cover!  Service was excellent, and the price was much less than I expected!  Heartily recommend checking this place out if you like Mexican food but don't care for pretence or scene-y-ness."}
{"text":"Chacho's is the best Mexican place I have been to in the city. Located in a mostly residential area it is not the sort of place you would likely find unless you were looking for it.  The decor makes you feel like you are in a Mexican persons home. I had the enchiladas with green mole which were delicious and tasted very healthy. The portions are big so come with an appetite. Another standout dish was the guacamole which tasted so fresh and light. Despite being out of my way I will definatly be returning soon."}
{"text":"Lovely people, super - delicious, thoughtfully prepared, the right portions, great margaritas, make sure to try the ceviche, traditional mexican, but with a couple of things you wouldn't get at every mexican place. The atmosphere is a little cozy, corny, and warm. This place is a little off the beaten path, so don't miss it! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing authentic Mexican food! The price-point is excellent too! Is great for lunch (pick-up) and dinner. There are 3-4 other Mexican restaurants in the area, and this one has 1.) the best menu and 2.) the largest menu. It is quite small, so sometimes I just pick-up my order. I usually get the chicken burrito and sometimes I get some chips and salsa (so nice of them!). It's much more authentic than La Carnita. Doesn't have the trendy climate, but you're going for the good food anyway!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here with a friend who was craving Mexican food. Having lived in Houston, TX  five years, my husband and I definitely learned the difference between Mexican (Mex-Mex) and Texas (Tex-Mex), and Chacho's is mostly Mexican with some Tex-Mex influences.  So, my husband ordered tacos al pastor, but they were out of that... so he  settled on tacos al carnitas. Tasty but \"unseasoned.\"  Our friend and I ordered enchiladas (chicken) with salsa  served with rice and refried beans AND chicken in mole sauce served with rice and refried beans and three warm corn tortillas. We found the chicken was dry / overcooked, the tortillas were good, salsa verde was tasty, and mole was not as deeply flavourful as it should have been.  But service was good, the setting was nice, clean and quiet.  We'll consider returning, if we don't find better Mexican food in Toronto."}
{"text":"With very few non-fast-food Mexican options, Chacho's is a nice addition to the fabric of midtown Toronto. The decor is homey with beautiful clay plates off setting the stained glass windows throughout the restaurant. The staff are friendly, helpful and more than happy to make recommendations.   The first thing I tried was the house Margarita. Made from scratch with Tequila imported from Mexico (no Cuervo much to my delight!) and fresh lime juice. Tangy and refreshing. I highly recommend them.  Next were the nacho's, which were phenomenal, served expeditiously with fresh crema and guac. Very light, not greasy at all, and leaving me wanting more. That's how nacho's should be!  Flauta's are my absolute favorite thing in Mexican cuisine, and these did not disappoint. Crispy, hot and packed with braised steak, they are easily the best in Mid-town Toronto.  My main dish, which I try to have at all Mexican restaurants that I attend, was the Chicken Tinga Enchilada. The chicken was slow cooked to perfection with the tomatillo and diabla sauce complimenting it perfectly.   The food was great, the drinks were great and the service was good. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I have had outside of Mexico and it was better than some there as well!  The appetizers, mains and desserts were delicious and fresh, nicely presented and the portion sizes were generous. We've tried six different dishes now and have only good things to say. !Muy Rico!  The service is friendly and attentive. When I attempt to use my now rusty Spanish there is no laughing -just encouragement!  The outside of the building hides a cozy, mexicana atmosphere inside that makes me want to hang out with a cerveza and order another dish of the fantastic guacamole.  !Ole! Chachos!"}
{"text":"I am sort of torn here -- I would like to say 3.5 stars but there are no 0.5s.  We ordered the guacamole, the mexican salad, the mole poblano with the chocolate sauce and the fish burrito.  We loved the guacamole, the burrito, the chocolate mole sauce (yummy yum yum!) and the rice which comes with the main dishes.  If that was all there was to it I would give this place 4 stars.  But I didn't think the chicken was all that good -- it tasted, well, too chickeny -- I'm very picky about my meat, I like it fresh fresh fresh and this one didn't taste fresh fresh fresh.  It was still fine, i.e. fresh nothing wrong with it, it just didn't taste amazing.  In general I would most likely come back to this place but stay away from chicken."}
{"text":"There were soon many amazing reviews about Chacho's that it has been on my To-Try list for a while. However, I have to agree with my girl Itanni B - whomp whomp.  I mean, the food was good but it was also very bland. There was no kick and no flavours that I would expect in Mexican food. The portions were very small and pretty pricey (about $12-20 depending on the dish). If you're looking for a good sit-down Mexican in midtown, I would recommend Mariachi's."}
{"text":"I have an addition for ceviche and this one was one of my worse one. the fish was warm, it seemed they cooked it instead of marinating the fish with lime. there was lots of mango hiding the taste of the fish. the fish has to be the star in a ceviche not the mango"}
{"text":"I've been curious about this neighbourhood restaurant for a while...there always seem to be people inside.  A neighbour made the recommendation and raved about the guac and chips - which I did not try.  Btw, not your typical Mexican decor as the use to be a steakhouse, so a bit dark and den-like.  I got the enchiladas to go.  I love Mexican food, but this dish was just ok.  There were 3 enchiladas and rice and refried beans on either side.  The enchiladas were cold in the middle (not warm - cold).  The rice and bean serving was maybe 3 tablespoons, so not much.  For the $20, I'll probably walk the extra 5-6 blocks and order from the other Mexican restaurant up the street."}
{"text":"Margaritas are amazing.  Food is delicious. Has a good kids menu. So a great place for the family to go when good Mexican is the craving."}
{"text":"Can't really say anything bad about Chaco's.  I mean I wasn't blown off my chair in any sense, but that's not a bad thing.  I wasn't disappointed, I just wasn't wowed.  Anyway, this restaurant is a bit of a walk from the nearest subway stop at Davisville station.  Inside the restaurant there's hardwood tables/chairs and the decor is...well...meh.  I think the TV station was repeating some commercial about back pain or some ish that was a little bit distracting and mildly humurous as it was in Spanish.    The food was good, hearty, authentic Mexican.  I do enjoy my Mexican food and I always want to order more and more, however the prices here made me keep myself in check.  Luckily there's a convenience store around the corner where you can grab some Doritos if your cash is somewhat stretched.  The service here is good. No problems there.  The place is a little bit pricey for my liking, so I would probably come back only if I got a raise as I'm willing to take the extra 30-45 minutes and get some lower priced Mexican food.  All in all, you could do worse than Chaco's, so if you're in the area, there's no reason not to check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"I went to this tucked-away spot because it was across the street from my brother-in-law's place. When I walked in, I was instantly transported back to the 70's: dark and heavy wood, wood paneling, retro colours. While in some ways it might seem a little shabby, I found it deeply comfortable and inviting.  The server was super friendly and kind, and made sure to pace our meals out really nicely.   The guacamole here is made to order, each and every time. It was so good! It had cilantro, tomato, a tiny bit of onion, a bit of lime, and of course buttery avocados. (Since it is made to order every time, you could ask to leave out some of those ingredients if you don't like any of them.) Oh, and the chips tasted fresh and house-made, too.   Our meals were all really good. The chicken felt fresh and home-made, the cotija (I think?) on our meals was generous and tasty.   Oh and the margaritas! So delicioius -- and pack a punch, too. I only had a little bit because I was going to be driving, but I could have gotten myself in some trouble with those things. The rest of the table split the pitcher quite happily. They also made a virgin mango \"margarita\" for my 13-year-old, and he loved it.   We didn't have any dessert, but my coffee was decent. I thought I caught a whiff of cinnamon, but I wasn't sure. It's not that strong, but it tasted good enough.   Aside from all this the prices were more than fair. I don't remember actual dollar amounts, but I remember thinking that for four dinners, a pitcher of margaritas, etc. that it was pretty good.   I definitely want to go back to this place and try other things besides the enchiladas I had. I wish it were closer to home!"}
{"text":"We visited Chacho's at lunchtime on a Saturday. The restaurant is cosy and affords a nice outlook to Merton St. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, quickly bringing a basket of corn chips to our table alongside some excellent green and red salsas. The entrees arrived soon after and proved delicious. The tacos, enchiladas, and burritos were authentic, nicely presented, and of generous quantity. They were quickly devoured. Brother in law and I enjoyed a couple of Mexican beers which washed it all down nicely. Welcome to the neighbourhood, Chacho's. We'll be back - soon."}
{"text":"Sometime's there are places in Toronto, that make you feel like you are elsewhere. Chacho's is definitely one of these places tucked away in a not very busy street off of Mount Pleasant. It reminded me  a restaurant I visited in Mexico. Everything from the Mayan Decor to the music and even the servers.  I walked in at 10pm as the website said they were open till 11pm. However the server said the kitchen is closed. I obviously looked very disappointed and at that point the owner intervened and asked us what to order. So wuth rapid decision and a quick glance of the menu. I ordered the enchillada's and shrip taco.   Was good authentic food. The Mole was amazing but I guess it wasnt as spicy as i generally enjoy Mexican. However, the hot sauce did do its job. If you are looking for a place that is like no other, give this place a try. I dont regret going there at all!"}
{"text":"It would be nice to try it if they were available. Yelp says they are open at 11.  Their website says 11:30 on Sundays.  Went there at 11:40.  It was pitch black inside.  They were not supposed to be on holiday hours as that was supposed to have ended Jan.6. Also back in the fall I had requested delivery (I am a couple blocks away).  They said the do not do delivery despite what it says on their FB page and also their website.  They also deleted my comment off their FB page when I mentioned they do not do delivery.  What the heck people?"}
{"text":"Very good! My son and I were craving nachos so we looked to Yelp and found this place. It was 4pm on a Tuesday and it was just us. The man who served us was very nice but also let us have our privacy even tho there was nobody else there. The nachos were so good and so filling! Sometimes you get nachos with a bunch of slop thrown on chips and most of the chips end up with no toppings and the middle becomes soggy. These were spread out and every single chip had fresh delicious toppings. We were so full by the time we were finished with the nachos but we had already ordered burritos. I loved the grilled tortilla the burrito was wrapped in and the fillings were just the right amount of everything. You could tell there was no reheating being done, these were made to order. We could each only eat half so we brought the rest home to eat after our food coma subsides. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I would definitely give this place a 5 if they could manage the service a little better. I actually hate complaining about this because the server is actually very good, he hustles around and is very friendly. He just needs a little help to bus tables.  The food is uncomplicated and feels authentic. I'm a big fan of the tacos, and they have several to choose from.  It's a great Mexican option in the area, parking right along side of the building."}
{"text":"First place I review on yelp. Because i have never been so disappointed. I am wondering how did this place get a 4 star review. The enchiladas are absolutely the worst I have ever had. The chicken breast in there was extremely dry. Portions were tiny too. The nachos did not have much toppings. Also ordered tamales, which also had chicken breast that was ultra dry. Overall, the worst Mexican food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Just came back from dinner.  I agree that it's authentic but much better Mexican restaurants are to be found in Toronto.  The margaritas are in a word - terrible - and I can't figure out what went wrong but didn't even taste like tequila.  The tortilla soup was very good, guacamole was fair -avg but my main of enchiladas was poor, very soggy and bland.  Very disappointed in food but most disappointed in drinks. We usually go to Miriachi on Young which is reasonably close and really regret not going there tonight as their margaritas are perfection and their food is higher quality."}
{"text":"Very disappointed about this restaurant, I went with my family and friends for brunch on Sunday, and it was closed without any notice. It says on their webpage open on Sundays at 11:30, we went almost 1pm."}
{"text":"Found this place from Yelp reviews as I was in the area .. Was not disappointed!   Food .. delicious and portions very impressive. Waitress was lovely, friendly and attentive. Place had a cozy hidden romantic feel.. Although you would never know from the outside   Would I have found this place without yelp .. No way as it's one of those hidden gems. So glad I did .. As this will be one of my go to spots when I'm in the mood for Mexican in Toronto.   5 out of 5 for me guys .. Good Job ;)"}
{"text":"The ceviche and black bean soup were delicious! They have many flavours of Jarritos for teetotalers (the grapefruit flavor is surprisingly low in sugar), and a full bar.   I ordered the fish tacos and quickly realized how much more filling they are than they look. Partner enjoyed whatever it is he had.  Lost points for having only one server working during dinner hours (slow service but not glacial), and for daring to charge $7 for two churros."}
{"text":"OMG... Ok let me start with -I'm Mexican- and I know I don't look Mexican but I am. Someone from work recommend me this restaurant, I was surprised when she told me the location because I live reaaally close and I've never heard of chachos before and I LOVE my mexican food, so the other day my hubby and I payed a visit to check it out.  Let me start with the area, it's hidden and probably if you are not looking you are not going to find it but once you are inside the place will transport you to mexico, it's not the typical \"fondita\" looking style, it's causal but elegant at the same time, it's like being in a mexican house.    We saw the menu and we were surprised by all the options We started with an order of fish tacos and tacos al pastor, we were expecting those small \"taquera\" tortilla (because that's what you usually get with fish and pastor tacos) we were wrong, the portions are pretty generous, the tacos come with a double tortilla (just like in Mexico  ) so they are filling (a lot) and delicious, I mean DELICIOUS.  We didn't know that the sizes were going to be that big so previously we ordered enchiladas, I ordered the mole rojo (amazing) and he ordered the mole verde (great as well) everything was amazing,  the food was incredible we both felt as if we were in Mexico not only the food was great but the drinks too and when we thought nothing could be better I ordered the  flan  (I know .... I was full but I couldn't resist) BEST FLAN IN TORONTO.   Honestly it was perfect, everything, the service, the place, the food, the drinks !!  It makes me sad that places like this, with amazing food are not getting as much attention as they should.  ITS A MUST"}
{"text":"First time here and it won't be the last, did not disappoint. I've been to Playa Del Carmen went to eat local small hole on the wall restaurants came back to Canada and couldn't eat at those corporate Mexican places. We were in the area looking for a Latin restaurant and I found this place. There isn't that many tables but the meat in the burritos and fajitas (what we had) were delicious. We are already looking forward to our next visit since there's so many other items I'm dying to try."}
{"text":"So good! Fish tacos are awesome! Tasty fresh guac and the salsa is great.  It's a small little place that gets pretty busy during lunch and dinner.  Service is a little slow, but the food makes up for it. Always craving those fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Who are these people who gave this place a bad review???  It was seriously the best mexican I've had in ages.    Margaritas - had fresh ingredients and were super yummy Ceviche - fresh and delicious Guacamole - possibly the best I've ever had and the chips were great Fish tacos - fresh tasting fish, lovely mix of flavours Enchiladas - admittedly my least favourite of all the dishes I suppose, was still really good - the sauce was great  Restaurant WIN!!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill! Slow service and cold, questionable, \"Mexican\" food. There are better restaurants around."}
{"text":"I should have taken a picture of my Green Mole with Porkribs. It looked NOTHING like that of previous reviewer Grayce Y. She had a good amount of mole (sauce) on one slab of meat. Mine was like pulled pork tossed in a little bit of sauce. The meat tasted good but the sauce had no flavour. The mole chefs in Oaxaca would have spat at it.  And the food was lukewarm, not hot.  We waited quite a long time for our meal and the appetizer arrived AFTER the main courses. I really regretted ordering it: quesadilla al pastor. The meat was scaringly on the SOUR side and reminded me of the frozen boxes of schwarma that ARZ (middle eastern) supermarket had on sale last year.   I admit that we are spoiled and picky, haven eaten all over Mexico City and Oaxaca as well as San Francisco's Mission District. If I am ill tonight, I will be sure to update this review."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for quite a while now, as it's in my 'hood. Had dinner here with a friend tonight and it was alright, but a bit pricey for what you get. Service was extremely slow, because there was only one server working for the whole restaurant. Our drinks actually came out after our meals.   We ordered chips and guacamole to start, as it's made fresh to order. It had all the right stuff, but somehow lacked flavour. Good thing we had some hot sauces to add a bit of kick.   I had the carnitas tacos and my friend had the enchiladas. Both were alright, but the pork in my tacos was quite dry. I added hot sauce to the tacos as well, because they, too, lacked a little something.  I was really hoping to be wowed, but instead I left feeling a bit disappointed.   I'll go back to try a few more things on the menu, and hopefully I can add a star to my next review. I do hope today was not a good representation of what this place is about."}
{"text":"So good. Wanted to eat the entire meal again. Brought some friends here who know more about Mexican than I do and one of them said she now plans to bring her Texan boyfriend here, so he can experience quality Mexican food in Toronto. Plus I love the over-the-top kitschy decor."}
{"text":"Got some take out after finishing work nearby. I had chicken tacos. Fantastic. The friendly server gave me four separate hot sauces for it! I couldn't even decide which one I liked most.   The guacamole was amazing! Even my husband who doesn't like Mexican enjoyed it. Some of the best guacamole I've ever had!   Definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"I think I may have finally found it - my Holy Grail of Mexican food in Toronto - a true taste of Mexico and it's just down the street from me!   After finding out my usual, Mexico Lindo, was closed for Cinco de Mayo (say whaaaa?) I found out about this place that opened only about a month ago and decided to try it because I love Mexican food and had yet to find an ideal place in this city.  The food: Guacamole is awesome! Better than Lindo's , who cheapen-it-up adding sour cream or mayo - which some people like. Chacho's is Just pure, perfectly ripe avocado with a few nice chunks inside, with some spices, tomatoes and onions for flavour - and served with two delicious hot sauces - red and green (a different kind than what come on the enchiladas, though).  The chips were thin and crispy-fried. No sour cream/mayo fillers or store-bought chips here. Worth the $8 - as it comes in two apparently small containers, but after eating one to myself I was almost too fill for dinner. I took the other bowl of guac home. :)  Enchiladas in salsa verde (green sauce): This is how they should be done! Simple and authentic: shredded chicken, folded corn shells (NOT flour - enchiladas are never made with flour tortillas), cheese and crema - so delicious. This is how the food was served to me when I was visiting the Yucatan peninsula, , so yes, I believe this is very authentic stuff. A few pieces of onion on top  I kicked to the side as I only like raw onion in my pico de gallo.  My friend had the pork leg tacos, which were much bigger than I thought with almost a double-corn tortilla underneath. I tried a bit of the meat and liked the spices, but I generally prefer steak or chicken. No rice or beans with the tacos but they come filled with more stuff. People who think the portions are small must be used to a Denny's BIG SLAM brekky every day - cause I was so full I could barely move at the end. Is it a bit pricey? $16 for enchiladas is a bit much, but same price as you'd pay at any place downtown (Hernando's hideaway, Jalapeños - if they still exist),but it was shredded white meat with delicious refried beans and rice. Sometimes, you do get what you pay for. Take the extra walk to this place over Mariachi's on Yonge where they give you either dark meat (yuk) or they give you hunk of black-charred white meat with grisly bits and the price is the same for white meat.   One more note: I wanted to dock a star cause our service was a bit slow. With only one waitress working,  the owner was casually chatty with the customers - heard him talking to people about Mexico, Lucha Libres, etc,  BUT he should be stepping in, talking orders and facilitating the kitchen's orders when he has only one staff member, one cook and a half-full restaurant (10 tables at least). I've seen good places go down on Kitchen Nightmares because the owners are looking for a social experience instead of a really challenging job working with food (which is the reality of owning a kitchen).  I really hope they keep up the AWESOME, fresh quality of food, because I find after a few months to a few years, a lot of places start cutting corners. Don't do it!  The decor was also nice and not so cheesy as other places - with a nice lack of sombreros and figurines - a fairly upscale look. They were lacking bar service though and only had beer, wine and tequila (and margaritas. Margaritas were $11 so I decided to stick with water). But if you want to get hammered you can always go to red lantern right next door afterward.  I really hope this place stays in business - as it is in the middle of nowhere. But they are surrounded by retirement homes and condos and the only other places nearby are Red lantern and KFC, so maybe they can capitalize on the local clientele. Either way, there is parking at the side and they do take out - which is amazing - and I plan on taking advantage of that.   Viva la Mexico!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in this place because after searching a number of places for a group of 10, I found this Mexican restaurant with decent reviews and was able to get a reservation. The lady on the phone told me the kitchen closes at 9:30pm, but I told her i would get there around 9:05pm. We arrived at 9:10pm and she refused to seat us. The business hours on the door said 12:30am closing. I understand the kitchen closes at 9:30, but 20 minutes was way more than enough time to place an order for our group because we were ready. She \"tried\" to speak with the chef, but their attitude was so bad we didn't want to stay anyway. Someone outside the place told us this is not the first time this happens to a group of people. They have closed the doors on other customers. HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"Visited here on a Saturday evening. Atmosphere was overall pretty quiet - I think they would have benefitted from actually turning the music up louder. Service was quite friendly however.   We opted for the fish tacos, chicken tacos and enchiladas. Fish tacos were the standout here - very tasty ! Chicken tacos were just okay and although the enchiladas were pretty good they were not very warm coming out of the kitchen. We ended with churros for dessert which were delicious. For drinks we tried sangria, michelada, and margarita which were all pretty good. Michelada is kind of like a Caesar but with beer - interesting choice if you're looking for something different.   Overall, I think I prefer the taco places in the city which are maybe less authentic but more interesting and fun. I think this place is going for the more family owned authentic food but to be honest it was just a little too boring for my taste. As there are so many tacos places to try in the city, I don't think I'd return."}
{"text":"This is a neighbourhood place for me so I've been there a few times. The food is pretty good. I really like the ceviche. They never give enough tortillas for the faijitas (just 3 small ones) and they charge for extra. I've had mixed feelings about the nachos, sometimes I like them and sometimes they are a bit soggy and messy. Guacamole, fancy blender drinks are good. The atmosphere is nothing fancy but fine, I wish they would turn off the big-screen TV on the side, another pet peeve of mine is TV in non-sports bars.  In general I enjoy the food, my main complaints are that service is slow and the place is freezing, winter or summer. It's not just me, I see other people with sweaters or wearing their coats. It really affects the dining experience and who wants to remember a sweater if it's 30 degrees outside? I just don't understand why the staff doesn't pick up on the fact that patrons are wearing their jackets to get warm."}
{"text":"This place is terrible! We came here after reading so many good reviews on Yelp. Big mistake. We ordered a Margarita, Corona and guac to start. There was no one in the resto on a Thursday night at 7pm. The guac came out in ok time, but the issue was the drinks took at least 20mins. We had to ask again where our drinks were. The margarita was terrible. I should have known bc they didn't describe a tequila list. There was nothin fresh about this margarita, tasted like pre-packaged mix. No fresh limes. The nachos for the guac were greasy and burnt. Not good. The guac was ok, but would never order it again. the onions were mushy and it just didn't have flavour. After the experience were decided to just split 1 order of steak tacos. We asked for hot sauces... They sucked. Nothing fresh. Steak tacos were bland and tasteless w chopped up steak and onions. That was enough for us to get our bill and have dinner somewhere else. If u r looking for good Mexican, do not come here."}
{"text":"We dropped by Chancho's on a Thursday night and instantly I knew it was going to be great. It wasn't packed, but there was a warmth from the owners that can't be measured. It looked like there was one person on staff that night, don't know if that's just because it was 8:30pm. We ordered the green mole ribs, ceviche, tamale and tortilla soup. The ceviche was fresh and bright with plenty of fish and shrimp. It was served with saltine crackers and upon further research this looks like its a traditional way of serving ceviche. It was delicious nonetheless. The tortilla soup had wonderful chicken flavour and contrasted nicely with the avocado and crispy tortilla stripes. The mole smothered the fall-off-the-bone ribs and had a unique flavour front the sunflower seeds used to make it. Definitely worth trying. This place is a little hidden away from the high volume traffic on Yonge, but is a gem if you a willing to take a little stroll."}
{"text":"I'm not a Mexican food aficionado, but I *have* been to some great Mexican spots in San Francisco and indoctrinated to far more authentic cuisine than we normally get in Toronto. We ordered this from doordash, selecting Tacos Carnitas, Pazole, and Guacamole as our items. As well as a Steak Quesadilla for our more tex-mex inclined guest. :)  The tacos and quesadilla were delicious, will well-cooked meats and bold flavours. As has been the norm for me and more authentic Mexican cuisine, the dishes themselves were simple, allowing the flavours of the meats to come through, but hot, chipotle, or tomatillo sauces were included to add flavour if you so wish.  The Guac was the best I've had from delivery thus far, though I'm not a fan of tomato in Guacamole personally. Great flavour and just the right hint of spice. The home-made tortilla chips were excellent.  The Pazole had the right ingredients but missed the mark, unfortunately. The broth had no body and no richness, and the soup itself had a thick layer of oil on it. A great deal of spice needed to be added to make it edible.  So, 3/4 excellent dishes. We will order from them again but skip the soups."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from my roommate as it is fairly local to my area. I haven't been in many Mexican restaurants here in Canada but have been in many back in NYC and this spot is very authentic. I had tacos as my dine-in and took a burrito to go, very good quality of ingredients and the stone ground tortilla chips you get at your table are fantastic. Thumbs Up !"}
{"text":"We arrived at 7:40 tonight (Saturday) to find just one humourless, overwhelmed waitress working. It took 40 minutes just to get the two of us a diet coke. The guacamole and chips were outstanding, but the pork ribs in green mole sauce and beef tacos were awful - not that the server ever came back to check. The people at the next table waited at least 30 minutes for their dessert, so we got our bill and left. Astoundingly bad service, but at least the food was bland."}
{"text":"This little jem located in Midtown serves delicious, authentic Mexican food. I recently had dinner at Chacho's and will definitely be going back for seconds. The menu is well rounded and offerers a wide range of mouth watering dishes. Fajitas, Mole, Burritos, Enchiladas and tacos; Chacho's has something for everyone.   We started off with the Nachos, Flautas and  Margareta's, all of which were tasty and satisfying. We then ordered a number of tacos to share. Amongst the various tacos we ordered, our favorites included the: Tacos De Pescado (fish), Tacos De Pastor (marinated pork), Tacos De Tinga (chicken breast in chipotle salsa). The tables undeniable  favorite Taco of the night was the Shrimp Tacos which featured large,  perfectly spiced ,fresh shrimps.   Overall the service was fantastic, the food succulent, and the atmosphere inviting. Our party of four all agreed that Chacho's was miles ahead of Mariachi's (located around the corner on Young St). If your in mid-town and looking for a place to eat, this is the next restaurant you should check out."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, and I am still trying to find a restaurant in Toronto that meets my expectations. After reading several positive reviews on Yelp, I decided to give Chacho's Mexican Restaurant in mid-town a shot. When we go to the restaurant on a Sunday afternoon for lunch, the restaurant was deserted.  My friend ordered the Tortilla Soup ($6), and Fajitas ($15). I ordered enchiladas ($14) and a Margarita ($10).  Note that these are lunch prices.   The Good:  Food was simple but tasty  The Tortilla soup was delicious, and the flavors and textures were well-balanced  They agreed to put no onions in my food, and they did this successfully  The service was okay  The Bad:  No value for money--my friend and I were still very hungry after our lunch and had to go somewhere else to eat. This is unusual because I don't have a huge appetite.   Food was too expensive relative to the portions. Keep in mind that the prices for lunch are lower (after 3:30pm the enchilada would have cost me $16 for example). This amount of food for several dollars more at dinner would have been a complete rip off.   Margarita was too small and did not have enough tequila  Location of restaurant is smack in the middle of a residential area which is odd--that said, it sticks out among the condos and apartment buildings  We were never offered water. I asked for water and our waitress never brought it to us. Water should always be offered  We were given a dessert menu, but out of 4+ desserts, they only had 1 available  Sad that you did not get nachos or something to munch on, on the house. I am used to Mexican restaurants that offer you something to snack on while you wait for your food  Although dead, my friend and I had to get up and ask our waitress for several things, such as plates, hot sauce, sour cream, etc.   **If I had to rate the food and experience out of 5, I would give it a 2.5/5. I do not intend to return."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Delicious and good portions. My friend wanted fried ice cream and fried ice cream was not on the menu. Owner went out of his to get ice cream and made us fried ice cream. Can't say enough how much we appreciate there service. Our server was nice and very eager to help."}
{"text":"Average food, didn't wow me. Food was a bit too mushy and all flavors blended together."}
{"text":"The absolute best Mexican I've ever had in Toronto. The nachos are something I dream of. Homemade, warm and fresh toppings of delicious goodness. Simply divine. It's a masterpiece!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for something new in the area and found that the yelp reviews were good for this restaurant so we decided to try it. It was a weekday night but when we walked in were the only customers there. The place had somewhat of a clash of decor - an old pub and Mexican themed decorations.   To start we got the guacamole with corn chips which I would say was average but they were nice enough to give us extra corn chips when we ran out. For our mains I got the shrimp tacos and my boyfriend ordered the Green Mole with Porkribs. My order came with 3 tacos which I was impressed with the amount of shrimp they put in. It was cooked well and a little messy because taco was really stuffed with ingredients. For the most part I liked it but I felt like there was something missing in terms of flavour in it. They provide two types of hot sauce to put on your food but even with the hot sauce I felt like there was a little something missing. The Green Mole with Porkribs was ok. It was a little small in terms of portion size. It did come with tortilla on the side but I would have preferred more rice instead. The ribs were cooked well. It was soft, came apart really easily and had good flavour but again the portion size was a little small and it was actually lukewarm when it came out. In terms of price I would say it's not bad. Compared to other Mexican restaurants Ive been too I would say that for the most part it had decent prices. The place makes me feel like I'm eating home cooked Mexican food which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Our waiter was also really nice and helpful as well. I would probably give this place another try."}
{"text":"We live really close by and had been meaning to drop by for some time now. I'm glad we did because the food was authentically flavourful. After years of pub nachos, Chacho's nachos were a welcome change of pace. I look forward to the next time!"}
{"text":"Decent fish tacos, great \"homemade\" chips and guacamole. Odd location and overall weird vibe. Pretty sure it's a \"fakery\" or laundromat."}
{"text":"Great food. Spectacular burritos, very authentic enchiladas. Owner, presumably, showed us different hot sauces and pickled onions, very kindly giving us extra food. The enchiladas were great, the restaurant is really nice and very clean. The service was great. Very much family run and really well made food."}
{"text":"I went back for Valentine's Day and it was a Mexican delight. Tacos for sure. Nachos are a must. Oh and you can't forget Jarritos or Margaritass."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious and a new neighbourhood favourite. Like other reviewers noted it's a hidden gem!! Tucked away at Mt. Pleasant and Merton St.   As someone who has always loved Mexican food I found most of the city offerings a bit disappointing...until we found Chachos.    Highly recommend the Burrito de Tinga and the Pozole, among many other classic mexican dishes. Salsa verde and all salsa's are homemade and delish. Atmosphere is interesting and add's to the overall charm.   Restaurant staff is very nice and always welcoming, prices are reasonable and although it might some time for your order to make its way out of the kitchen, it's always worth the wait. Great spot for a large group, or just two.   The only thing missing is authentic mexican drinks, and I don't mean alcohol, drinks like Agua de Jamaica or Horchata.    If you are looking for something that is authentic and yummy, this is your pace!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in Toronto. Service was great, but room was chilly. I need to go back and try soemthing more complicated."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for February 14,which is also my husband's birthday. We walk in, almost every table is full, but I don't see a reserved table - I should have run at that point. We stood for way too long waiting while the server entered endless amounts of data on a computer. Almost no one has food, but... We finally sit down. 20 minutes later the sole server has brought food to one table, taken one order and is now the bartender as well. 25 minutes, no water yet, and server has yet to come over to table. We assess the situation, and leave. How do you have only 1 server on Valentine's day when you normally have at least 3? Epic fail!"}
{"text":"Good food...seems authentic. Decent prices...also do take out...never too crazy and easy to talk and hear other people. Staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Best ceviche ever!!!!!! I would come back just to eat it again. Our waitress was lovely. Def would recommend"}
{"text":"Went into Chachos a week or two ago to order some takeout. I live in the area, see it everyday, and love Mexican..perfect combo, right?   I ordered fajitas for two, and some type of burrito (can't remember the name of it right now).  Boyfriend loved the burrito..but the fajitas honestly were nothing to write home about. The beef was over cooked and tough, and the portion size was NOT for two people, more like one. I honestly felt like I could've whipped up the same thing at home with an Old El Paso kit. Definitely would not go back again."}
{"text":"I'm Mexican, with that said I 'm a hard critic when it comes to mexican food, and this restaurant is authentic and with awesome prices. Definitely worth to visit."}
{"text":"It only took 3 and a half years, but I finally found it! The REAL DEAL! And right around the corner from Yonge & Eg!  As soon as I walked in, I knew I was going to love the food - the smell. Ah, that lovely lovely sizzling fajita smell!   After devouring our first round of chips & salsa, the waitress not only brought more, but also gave us some of their habanero salsa - I think she could sense that we could take the heat. SO GOOD!  For our party of four, we ordered guacamole, flautas, a chicken burrito, and the enchiladas verdes. Everything was amazingly delicious (particularly the beans & rice, which I find most places mess up the most). The portions were generous enough that we had leftovers and I got to enjoy it all again the next day! HOORAY!  CANNOT WAIT TO GO BACK!!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and I think this restaurant is very underrated - it also makes me sad to see all the bad reviews because I've never had a bad experience there, nor have the people with me!   I am pretty sure this is a family-owned place so the service isn't the best as it is usually just one server who hustles the entire time (but I don't think it takes away from my dining experience). Also, everything feels really authentic which I absolutely love!  As for the food, I usually get the fish or shrimp tacos because I don't eat beef, etc, and they are always phenomenal. In fact, my ONLY complaint is that I always forget to ask for no cilantro and being Mexican, they love to use cilantro. As for the other people that I have gone with, they have also loved the place and their food (beef tacos, enchiladas, and I can't remember the rest), and we are always very happy to go back.   So if you love Mexican food, I highly recommend you give this place a try!  Oh, parking is also easy as they have a small lot and you can park on the street."}
{"text":"This place was a huge Letdown!  Four of us got takeout from this place when we were starving,  but by the time we got home we realized just hire small the portion sizes are.   Everything was under seasoned and bland,  which is surprising for Mexican food.  We had the:  Fish tacos  Chorizo tacos shrimp burrito  guacamole dip (ridiculously small)   I wouldn't go back there because although the food was not the best,  the value even worse."}
