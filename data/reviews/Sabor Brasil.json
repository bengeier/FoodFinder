{"text":"Really delicious food and great ambiance (it seemed like we were one of the few non-Brazilians in the restaurant). Food arrives slowly, but worth the wait if you're not in a rush! The server (only one in the restaurant, which is probably why things were moving a bit slowly) was awesome, helping us navigate the menu and making recommendations...she handled our large group very kindly. Great place overall!"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious however the service is always slowww and missing in action!"}
{"text":"Great brazilian restaurant. Came here for lunch in a Saturday and ate Feijoada, traditional brazilian food. My experience was great, my meal was perfect and delicious. The staff was absolutely polite and friendly. My Caipirinha, traditional Brazilian drink, was perfect.  I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Not sure, why they call it Restaurant. I found no difference with fastfood, but here i paid $60 instead of $7. They call it Stake, but i cal lit piece of meat. There are no home wine. They serve the same bottle beer from LCBO, but x3 time expansive. There are no any identity or fun in this place. This is small space with poor quality atmosphere and meal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Brasilian restaurant. The food is exceptionally delicious. It can compete with any place that I ate at in Rio! The picanha is cooked the way you like it and comes with perfectly cooked rice, beans and fried casava. I love the fresh fruit smoothes. They have recently expanded their menu which is great for someone who wants to try what Brasilian Cuisine has to offer. The staff are wonderful and the decor is tastefully done. The TV's always play Globo (a Brasilian channel) which entertains you while you eat."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner on a sunday and i must say the service and food was just excelent. Food came out hot and quickly, waitresses were polite and helpful.  Would recommend and go back for sure"}
{"text":"We love the food remain us of Boa Vista. Please if you want real Brazilian food try this place."}
{"text":"my brazilian friend took me and our friend for dinner. i had never had brazilian food before. the restaurant was lovely and clean.. the staff were friendly.. she did speak english for us and spoke portugese with my friend..  i don't like spicy food so i really enjoyed eating here! ha! i had the flank steak dinner with rice, beans, salad and fries.. it was all yummy! i think the prices were just slightly over priced.. but i would go here as a once in a blue moon sort of place.. and it not close to where i live.. so my friend better do the driving! ha!"}
{"text":"The place feels warm, with ambivalent personality: one fancy-old fashioned and another rustic-chaletish (the husband said that maybe they ran out of money jeje , I thought it was an interesting contrast).  They have plenty of big screens for a not that big restaurant, and it's cool that they had Brazilian tv on. The paints and pictures displayed on the walls were captivating.  The waitress was polite, educated; good skilled with authentic smile.  The 2 stars belong to the dish I asked for: The picanha sandwich. That really was a bad burger with a sandwich name... Commercial burger bread falling apart... With 4-5 stripes of a not astounding chewy meat with a meh cheese, a slice of tomato, some iceberg lettuce... Frozen not well seasoned fries... Definitely not worth the $15.something"}
{"text":"The food was really good and reasonably priced but the service was sub-par..even though the waitresses were very friendly. We waited over 30minutes between the soup and main and then another 30 minutes between main and desert.  If the service was better I'd give this place a 4.5 or even 5 The place is clean and cozy...I'll be back but hopefully next time the experience will be better   SML"}
{"text":"This is the best a la carte Brazilian restaurant I know of in Toronto. The menu has a good selection, the art on the wall is great and give the restaurant a good atmosphere. The desert selection is ok and the coffee is also good. I go there often with my wife."}
{"text":"I don't know much about Brazilian foods nor restaurants. But I know what good foods taste like. My friends brought me to this place. So I gave it a try. We ordered some appetizers, soups, and mains(soups was extremely salty... Fried polenta was ok) overall everything was sort of meh ... I didn't want to hurt their feelings but the food here really not worth $50 per person plus drinks..."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in here one day last year. I am so glad we did! I had never been to a Brazilian restaurant before and was excited to try it! I am glad to say I was not disappointed! I had the Escondidinho which came with rice. We also tried the Bolinho de Queijo (cheese rolls). Everything was delicious! The waitress was so nice and helpful. She explained what everything was and recommended some of the dishes to us. I will visit here again for sure!"}
