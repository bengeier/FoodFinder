{"text":"It doesn't get better than a $5 menu am I right?  Grozépa is a new resto/bar in Rosemont, offering a vast selection of dishes for just $5, with a few items for just a few more dollars. They also have a very extensive cocktails and drinks list, which is sure to please everyone.  Tried it out last night (Friday night) and as the evening progressed, the place got more and more packed and the ambiance became more club-like with the DJ.   The highlights of what I ordered were: the ravioli à la gigi (rosé sauce with mushrooms and pancetta) and the Grozépa poutine (loved the recipe for their homemade poutine sauce). I also really liked the Cesar salad, the gratinée onion soup, the warm spinach and smoked gouda dip and the cinnamon doughnuts with Nutella sauce.   I highly recommend Grozépa for a date night or a night out with friends!  For my full review and more photos, check out my blog: Turquoise Blog (link in bio!)"}
{"text":"I was very skeptical in trying this place at first after looking at their menu online. But as soon as we stepped in the door we were warmly greeted by the owner himself who explained to us the concept and showed us more detailed pictures of the menu.  As a vegetarian I highly recommend this place since most of the items are meat free, which you have the option to add on for a small fee to your pizza, pasta ... etc  After trying many 5$ restos ( Warehouse, Cinko, Mezcal, Pot Masson) one thing me and my bf were expecting was small portions. Therefore we decided to order 4 plates to share, a pizza followed by the blue cheese dressing iceberg salad, then the gouda spinach dip, finally to end with their poutine (w homemade sauce).   The portions were surprisingly generous so much that by the time the spinach dip arrived I was already so full! Nevertheless we managed to finish all the plates while sipping on a pitcher of raspberry mojito (which was very good & fair priced).  Everything was so good no doubts about it, this 5$ resto has definitely stepped the game up. The only thing i would say is that the fries on the poutine were a bit bland however the sauce was on point.  The service was friendly yet professional and the music was great! ( Dj on a Thursday night? Hell yeah!) I definitely recommend this place & forsure will come back to try their extensive choices of pizza and pasta!  P.s. The music can get quite loud since it is a resto/bar therefore don't sit too close to the speakers if you want to hear yourself talk."}
