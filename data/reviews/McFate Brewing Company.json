{"text":"This review is based on 3 separate visits to Fate. The beer was decent (not great but good enough) but the food is just very, very poor. Over 3 visits (ate at each one) one experience was mediocre (pizza came out OK, appetizers mediocre) and the other 2 the food was really just awful. I think they might need to be on Kitchen Nightmares."}
{"text":"Big, clean and super friendly space. Immediately welcoming, with friendly staff and a big board of ever changing beers. We we greeted by a great server who kept samples coming of beers he thought we'd like (thanks Jordan!) and awesome recommendations. So...service...A+

The food was really tasty, especially for a chill pub food vibes kinda place. The Chicken Sandwich thats battered in buttermilk with poutine was delicious...and my girlfriends pizza was The Jess and was very thin crust with A LOT of goat cheese and roasted garlic. Very delicious.

The beers were first class all the way. Juicy, gushing Pale Ales, classic west coast IPAs and some insanely unique brews...like cinnamon rice milk beers or beers infused with spicy peppers. They all hit the mark.

Great place!"}
{"text":"Terrible food.  The type of stuff that you would buy from the food distributor precooked.  Nothing from scratch nothing original very bland very boring. Beer was good."}
{"text":"Awesome food bs great beer. Dogs are friendly, and the servers are very nice. One of their bartenders, Dave, was particularly kind and respectful."}
{"text":"Decent beer and the appetizers are pretty good. Overall the atmosphere is pretty awesome. One big bar that has seating inside and out, they kick the heaters up high in the colder months, so you'll be plenty warm outside. Inside seems very modern with perfect view of their brewing operation. Service is amazing, our server was Faith, super bubbly and attentive, definitely made us feel welcome. The beer selection is great, their in-house brew selection spans from sours to ipa's to Hefeweizen. All good tasting. The hefe has strong notes of banana and clove, and the red ipa has a decent hoppiness to it. Overall I would definitely come back, and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I was pretty unimpressed with this brewery.  It's wall to wall shallow, empty bros and the beers are very pedestrian.  Nothing was particularly interesting or flavorful as far as my palate was concerned.  I expect there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"Not your typical brewery! I was a little hesitant to go to Fate because I've been to a bunch of \"gourmet beer bars\" that have bizarre trendy beer flavors and I am usually let down. I expected the beer to be similar here - poorly paired flavors that weren't good and didn't make sense. I was pleasantly surprised! The beer here is extremely unique and the way they get the flavor of each beer is by using smart ingredients and methods. The sour beer is a favorite among my friends and the pretzels are an awesome pairing. The food is really well done too. It seems the owners care about making good beer and food and not just having a trendy money maker. They have a veggie burger that can be made vegan too! The staff's always been attentive and brought orders pretty quickly even when we had a work function in the back room with about 20 people. 
Finally a bar that does the name brewery justice."}
{"text":"Best bar food I've had in Scottsdale. Good atmosphere. Good prices. Good service. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Went to McFate because of the reviews on the beer and they didn't disappoint. They had over 15 selections to choose from when I went, however their selections are changing constantly. I tried a flight because I couldn't decide. I was most impressed by the Hatch Chile Gatos, what a beer experience that was, all the flavor of Chile without the heat... and being from New Mexico anything with Chile is a must try. The beer is definitely more sharp compared to other breweries I've been too. They are delicious though. The bartenders could have been better. They all seemed to be in a bad mood, took about 15 minuets to get their attention to even order a beer and they weren't busy at all. All the food looked delicious too, I got guac and chips which was yummy, but people around me ordered some good looking food. I liked the atmosphere, part indoors and outdoors, great music, big television. Five out of five for the beer... 4 out of 5 for the service"}
{"text":"Stop at any time for great craft beer and good food!
I like Place with open space.  Today I'm enjoying breezy beautiful weather at patio for lunch! Ah I enjoy life..."}
{"text":"Hilarious beer descriptions and surprisingly delicious beer. Jesse was awesome - a really fun guy. Coming from a bunch of northwest beer snobs, this place was legit. This was this best experience of our weekend in Phoenix. Ask for Jesse."}
{"text":"The beer was exceptional. We did multiple flights and enjoyed everyone we tried. Hats off to the brewers, you are doing an exceptional job and are the ONLY reason I will come back. The food was absolutely horrendous. I had a burger and literally only could have 3 bites before I lost my appetite. I ordered it med-rare, and it came out well done. Absolutely no flavor. Wasn't even seasoned, it's amazing what something as simple as salt and pepper can do to poor quality ground meat! What's amazing to me is that there was so much grease left in a party that you killed it on the flat top! The bottom bun wasn't toasted at all so it was completely soggy and unable to be picked up. I got a side of \"poutine fries\" and couldn't believe what came out. Shoestring fries that had been sitting under a heat lamp for at least 30 min. The cheese and bacon looked like it was cut by Helen Keller and a nasty red onion \"sauce\" that Definitely is not gravy. Maybe I'm a little over critical because I've been in the culinary field for 20 years but your execution of something as simple as a burger was pathetic. It's really a shame that such great beer has to be paired with such nasty food!"}
{"text":"A great neighborhood brewery!  Their beer is consistently great - especially candy bar milk Stout. Food and service is good, but I wouldn't say outstanding, hence the 4 stars. Definitely recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Excellent.  They are open on Sundays now.  Our hiking group with 2 dogs had lunch here on New Years Eve.  I had the Ceasar salad with Salmon.  Very good.  Excellent service, good food.  There were about 20 of us on the patio and no one had any complaints all too busy scarfing down the food.  I am sure we will be back after a hike again."}
{"text":"I love that this place opened up in my neighborhood!! Have only been there twice so far, food I've tried has been good, service excellent, and the patio is dog friendly! The patio is really cute, the only thing I didn't get was why it was SO BRIGHT out there! Like glaring spotlight bright. Soft string lighting would be much more pleasant. Looking forward to our next visit to try the interesting pizzas on the menu!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite breweries! The food is awesome but the service is incredible! Kendyl was our \"main\" server and was so great. We also had about 7 other people serving our table which makes the seevice super fast! We even had Steve the manager stop by.  Thanks for the great experience McFates!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the second time, such a better experience. There was one bartender, Shaun, who was getting crushed, and yet, was extremely cool and calm, explaining beers, etc. A much better experience. 
Thanks Fate for redeeming yourself."}
{"text":"We came here based on several recommendations from friends, and Fate did not disappoint! The pizzas and burgers were delicious, the staff was friendly and attentive, and the beer was delish. We especially liked the Oh My Gatos, the Cuppa Joe Porter. We would highly recommend this place and we'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I love McFate! Great service, awesome selection of beers and really good food. The atmosphere is great and I love that they have live music sometimes. There is also a back room that is used for private parties- I've attended 2 here and had great service. Management is involved and friendly as well. Wish they would open one on the East side!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now and they're slowly starting to get things together. Service can still be slow at times, but it's a really nice place with a great atmosphere. The beer is always good too. The food is ok though. Be warned the Peggy-Rita Pizza is just a bunch of dough and a small bit of sauce and toppings in the middle. Veggie burger is also very dry, but regular burgers were good. The beer is really what gives this place 4 stars just wish the service was faster so I can start drinking when I get there."}
{"text":"Clean with a good inside to outside bar with friendly staff. Like that they have a dog friendly patio! TV'S both inside and out. Food was average as was the wine selection. Vegetarian pizza and fish sandwich were ok. Worth noting is they were out of tater tots. Definitely just a place to drink beer and watch the sports on tv."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times, and have been pleasantly surprised with quick service no matter how busy it is. The pizzas are excellent (different and memorable). I've taken my 2 year old and he played with crayons they brought to us but of course sitting outside, the traffic was entertaining to watch too for that age!"}
{"text":"I expected this place to be snobby,  hipstery, and very Scottsdale.  It was actually a pretty diverse crowd,  chill vibe, mostly alt-y music.  We went in on Wednesday night, enjoyed a lovely beer flight,  lots of great beer.  We got a roasted grape salad with salmon, which was off the chain, so good.  We also had a Margherita pizza,  equally good.  I'll definitely be going back,  and I hope they are successful for a long time."}
{"text":"Local South Scottsdale Joint. I can't say enough good things about this place! This place has a local owner who is truly locally born and raised - frequents at the local restaurants and he's a solid dude. Very impressed with his locally focused priorities and being able to see local bar owners frequenting local joints! These guys need our support! Great local brew and food!"}
{"text":"Bad choice of beer, crappy food, shitty service. They clearly don't appreciate return customers. Been there well over 5 times and they seem to always let us down"}
{"text":"Love this place! Family friendly, service is always great and fast, food is delicious - they make their own pizza crust and you can tell. Obviously the beer is delicious they have an option for everyone. And I could go on and on but you get the point. Menu favorites: spinach dip, classic pizza, wings!"}
{"text":"Beer - Great! Never tried one of theirs I didn't like.

Food - It was good but I don't think I would go here just to eat.

Service - The bartenders know what they are talking about but they could be more friendly. I almost feel bad saying it that way but its true.

Look - The restaurant and bar LOOK awesome! The patio is cool as well. Great place to go and hang out.

Notes: Ask the bartender for recommendations. They know their stuff."}
{"text":"Great place with amazing food. Pizzas are delicious and great to share. Wings and Caesar salad recommended as well!! Definitely going back to this place."}
{"text":"Nice people and delicious pizza. This may sound petty but the chairs just killed my back and legs. I wouldn't return willingly just because of that. It's hard to hang with friends when all you want to do is adjust to try to be comfortable or stand. Honestly that is the only issue with the place."}
{"text":"Having a bad day? Need a beer? Maybe a cool person who loves Star Wars as much as you do? Nice.... Head on over to Fate Brewery on Scottsdale and McDowell and make sure you get Faith. Coolest server you'll find, and you can nerd it out while you get your beer on.


Faith at Fate is the best server ever!"}
{"text":"Our first visit recently for lunch, we had the beer-battered fish fry with FRESH seasoned veggies and the buffalo chicken wrap. Both were great! While we did not sample the brews this time, we will be back to check out the beer and more tasty entrees."}
{"text":"Seriously, some of the best beer in the Phoenix area. I didn't try the food, but was really blown away by the Chardonnay Barrel Aged Beet Saison. What? Yup. I begged them for a growler of it, but they denied. I would have denied me to, and left some for the rest of you guys. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Wait, you're telling me it's the best sports weekend of the year, NFL Divisional Round Playoffs....

...and 50% of your Main TV's are playing \"fail\" videos from YouTube?

And when asked, you simply say, \"that's the way it is, those are always playing?\"

C'mon now, you're better than that."}
{"text":"The beer was excellent. The fish and chips were...... Not..... No taste to the batter AT ALL. The set up is nice. They can accommodate large groups and outdoor seating is comfy."}
{"text":"I'm in town for a wedding and had some time to kill before all my friends got off of work. Decided to grab some drinks at McFate before heading further north to watch some spring training. Both beers I had were really good. Started off with the Fateful IPA and moved onto the No Nelson Pale Ale. They have a full menu, but I didn't try anything. The pizza looked amazing though! They have a large bar in the shape of a horse shoe, a good size patio, and a fairly large dining area as well. TVs are all over the place so you can catch your favorite game. Staff was very friendly and got me some sample splashes to point me in the right direction. I wish they were a little more interactive, but they were busy. I don't see why I wouldn't come back next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Super cool place. Good food, good brews, good music, good ambiance. Lol can I say good anymore?! Sweet indoor/outdoor space......solid all around! The key lime pie was to die!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to McFate on a regular basis at least 3 times a month and sit at the bar, if Garrett is not working in the afternoons then it is a different experience! They have a new guy who has been working for them a while but new to the bar area and he is totally not on top of things. I had to ask for water three times and also sat for about 15mins before I was even approached. Now if he is working on the days I go I will sit at a table! If I were reviewing Garrett who even remembers you and what you like to drink then I would be giving them 5 stars! I do love the beers and my favorite salad is the grape w/ salmon, the dressing is delicious. Also the chicken club is really good! Hopefully this guy will get up to speed and if he actually look at you in your face when talking to you then maybe he will remember what you asked for!"}
{"text":"Feed the hunger and thirst of the masses. In truth will have to try it again. That fact alone is enough to like the place. Server was great. The Hatch Chile infused beer was awesome. House pretzel was too."}
{"text":"I dig this place. I had been to the other one in North Scottsdale off Shea but the size and quality of the building lets me know business is good at Fate. Glad to see success first hand."}
{"text":"Trash service. Trash food. Decent beer tho. Don't get this burnt ass sandwich too, it's the crispy chicken sandwich. It was so crispy it could tear up your gums, do not recommend."}
{"text":"Listen...the staff is AMAZING, friendly, prompt, and easy on the eyes they make you feel right at home...even my dog is a celebrity...aside from the food that is outstanding, this is a home away from home...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"Simply delish with great atmosphere red ale is great. Service was nice and fast for lunch"}
{"text":"Great local brewhouse! So, Fatality has undergone a slight change in the formula, but I love it! No matter if you are just \"a beer drinker\" or if you are a true beer aficionado, there is something for you here. They also have a great menu, and the garlic burger....YUM! Must pair it with the sweet potato fries!

I frequent this place often, and both the management AND staff really take care to notice, which is really nice to see in this world of free agency. LOCAL, and WONDERFUL."}
{"text":"Just went for a beer, the fireplace and dog friendly patio, didn't try the food. Had the Irish Red and a Gingerbread stout (or something like that) both were really tasty. The service was great too."}
{"text":"I was feeling a little spicy when I came in.  I tried the Fire Burger with the Hatch Chili Beer.  Both were delicious and served by a friendly and knowledgeable server.  I especially like the patio with the beautiful weather we are having!!!  This is a great place to get a local brew from a brewer that knows what he is doing!!"}
{"text":"Solid brewery with a nice selection of in house beers. Had their Citra hopped sour, which was refreshing, and their big IPA which was dank in a good way. The blackened chicken BLT was solid, as were the tots. Good choice for local beers and food if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went in with a few friends on 10/11/16 at night to check it out, as someone who's bartended for years the first thing I noticed was the bartender gave us all waters before grabbing our order .
Making this review short and sweet I'm going to say with this: the bar top was enjoyable to drink on, the environment is great, bartender was nice, but the two beers that I had while I was there (and I'm a huge craft beer guy) were some of the best brews i have literally ever had in my life, I was honestly sitting there astonished because they were so good.
Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed with our recent visit to McFate.   The beer list was extensive however the beers were marginal in flavor.  We ordered the Northeast Mode and ended up not finishing it.  The food on the other hand was FABULOUS!  Ordered the pretzels for our appetizer and they were gone in no time!  If we didn't order dinner already we would have ordered another one for the table.  Our table ordered The Burger, Truff Driver pizza, and Crispy Chicken Sandwich.  We had no food left on our table.  We will be back for the food and give the beer another try."}
{"text":"Fun big brewery room with lots of good beer and great vibe."}
{"text":"Five stars for service, beer, atmosphere and some of the food. Chicken wings and a few other menu items don't stand up to the rest. Overall a great experience for a table of 7.
Several unique and not to be missed beers. If there is a chile beer aficianado in your life this is a destination!"}
{"text":"Half priced pizza all day Monday. Happy hour till 6. Seated outside next the the fireplace and Christmas tree. So deliciously perfect. Yummm."}
{"text":"It's just kinda ehh, the beer is kind of bland. It's odd that there's a Plato's closet attached to it. The patio seating is beautiful, inside the brewery is gorgeous as well. Food is kind of mediocre but I would recommend the poutine, it's actually pretty successful. 

I had tried one of the light flights and the beers all tasted the same, the chairs are extremely heavy as well."}
{"text":"Fate Brewing Company is the all-new South Scottsdale home for craft beer snobs (like me). With a very spacious interior and wide open concept, it's clear that Fate takes its brand image just as seriously as its beer.

First visit was on a Wednesday night. There were plenty of guests, but it was not \"busy\" or \"packed\" by any means. There is quite a lot of indoor and outdoor seating, which is great - you'll probably never get that packed-in-like-sardines feeling here.

The aesthetic and ambiance is very pleasant, very krafty, very clean and very modern. Plenty of wood and metal elements ground the aesthetic as decidedly modern industrial, which I love. Tables are made to look like butcher block, which is also fun.

Service was ok. Our waitress was very attentive and sweet. My friend ordered the sweet potato fries, but apart from that, we only stayed long enough for one beer a piece (long day, needed sleep more than alcohol).

I'll definitely be back to try some of the food offerings and the beer was yummy enough to persuade me back for more. If you haven't been, give it a shot - I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Grab a shirt while you're there, too - they've got plenty of merch.  ;)"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Food was just ok, menu didn't have many options and when you order a flight its only 3 you get. We were also or waiters only table and when we asked for more water I watched him go back, chat with co-workers then 4-5 minutes later come back with water. The place is a nice bar looking at it but definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Very solid beers, everyone I tried I liked a lot! Great variety of bar foods, pizzas and if you aren't a beer drinker they have you covered with a great assortment of wine and full bar. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Great beer! Amazing selection of their own beer! The Irish red and the Cuppa Jose was amazing! The Cuppa Jose was amazing!!! Like one of the best I have had! I ordered fries for a light snack and they brought it out in literally a minute and they were perfect!  definitely will be back to try the pizza and burgers! They sound and look amazing!!"}
{"text":"Monday's are half priced pizza night. We ordered the Sow Sweet pizza thanks to the recommendation of our server...Prosciutto, fig jam, mozzarella, goat cheese, sliced apple. This would never be my first pizza choice but WOW! It's a pizza I now crave. Paired it with a strawberry milkshake beer! YUM!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! The Candy Bar Coconut Bliss is out of this world! It's a must try.... Way to go go Adam and Steve you hit it  out of the park!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a date night here and it was great . The server was very attentive , beers came out almost immediately as well as the food we ordered. There was an error made with my wife's entrée but the manager came by to make thugs right without us even asking . Great experience , we will be back !"}
{"text":"Just go!!!! They always have good assortment of beers and pizzas are awesome. Plus their patio is great in nice weather"}
{"text":"Hatch Chile Gatos!!! One of the best beers I've tasted, ever. Spacious patio with plenty of heat lamps in the winter, 1/2 price pizzas on Monday & great service all the time."}
{"text":"Best bar food I've had in a very long time!  They have the best beer battered chicken tenders - with enough fries to fill you for a week!  Beer is good and decently priced.  Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Great menu, better selection than most brewpubs, excellent Hot Sausage pizza with harissa and goat cheese. Large assortment of beers for all tastes."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner with friends after a run one night and was really impressed.

While I was not surprised that they had a great selection of beers (it is a brewing company), what really blew me away was the selection of food.

I had the street tacos, which were delicious and the other food at our table looked excellent as well. In fact, I've been craving an open-faced steak sandwich and I'll likely be going back soon to try it their.

Also, the atmosphere was great. We sat out on the patio and it was fun, but if the weather didn't permit, the inside area looked nice as well."}
{"text":"The street tacos and mango slaw were delicious. The bartenders were so fun. Love it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Open, airy space especially with the doors open to the patio this time of year.  Our server was awesome and was super nice to accommodate hubby's multiple requests to sample various beers before making his final decision.  :-) Also, the food is fantastic. Tried the poutine, guac, and pretzels for apps - all three were yum, but the poutine was definitely the star with the delicious gravy and cheese curds.  Of course I had to try a burger...wish it had a slightly larger patty to keep up with the size of the bun, but definitely tasty and I would order again!  Hubby had pizza which he enjoyed and the others in the group had tacos and sandwiches. We were all stuffed and happy as we headed home."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's me... But it seems like everyone is now obsessed with craft beers. My coworker and I decided to choose this place for dinner after a long day of work. He raved a lot about this spot and said they had some great bites and amazing beers. I'm not a beer connoisseur, so I really didn't have my mind set on drinking as much as I cared about eating some good food. Everything on the menu looked appealing, to the point where I had a hard time making a solid choice. They have standard bar food like: your burgers/sandwiches, salads, nachos, tacos and pizzas. With the help of my waitress, I decided to try their hot sausage pizza. It was definitely hot in temperature, but not in flavor or spice. I was a little disappointed because it was not what I expected it to be. The pizza looked delicious, but tasted very bland. I honestly think I just ordered the wrong thing. I try not to order Italian food if I'm not at an Italian restaurant... You know? It's just not right lol but I'm open to exploring the restaurant a little more, it was such a nice venue with awesome hospitality!"}
{"text":"I wish this place had been open when I still lived here! It's literally a 1 minute drive down the road from where I lived in Scottsdale and it's brilliant!

Everything from layout and vibe to service and food quality was top notch - a definite spot to add to your Scottsdale list!

I went for a chicken club sandwich and a lager (I can't remember the name of it sorry) and both were fantastic. The bread for the chicken club particularly was to note as it was thick enough to hold all contents but not too heavy to make it hard to it - if you're a chicken club lover you'll understand.

Our server (again name gone) was brilliant as well, I don't remember having service that attentive before and I would never have expected it to come at a Brewing Company. But then again, he was an expert. He knew every single beer on the menu inside and out, he knew the flavours, the nodes, the colours and which beers matched which dishes.

A 5 star experience all round."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time has been nice - the food, beer, and service have all been good. The atmosphere is nice as well."}
{"text":"Tasty food.  OK beer.  Nice space, awesome patio and attentive service.  I will be back."}
{"text":"As a casual bar, this place is great with its nice patio, industrial seating, open main room, and lots of beer options on chalkboards on the wall. As a restaurant, the food is seriously mediocre and a bit overpriced. $8 guacamole and chips is a sad, sad itty bitty bowl of one mashed avocado. I decided to try the weirdest item on the menu, a pizza with roasted grapes, goat cheese and basalmic glaze. The toppings were odd and kinda worked, but mostly the thin crust pizza was burnt to hell and back on the bottom. So, go for a couple beers and sit on the patio. Be prepared for the smallest serving only guac ever (if you drop a scoop on a chip, it's like losing $0.50), and perhaps skip the grape pizza."}
{"text":"Nice place for a fast lunch. Place was clean and bright. I had the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and Fries. Recommend by Madi our server. Wrap and fries were awesome very filling. I could only eat half of it. We also got the kids Pepperoni Pizza. Pizza was huge for a kid it was also one of the best pizzas I've ever had. If you go on Monday they have half price pizza. Food was great service was ok. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have to say that the new Fate is incredible. They've covered all the bases. Need a big bar space? Check. Need lots of TVs? Check. Simply wonderful pizza? Check. Try the grape escape. Oh my. Wings? Check. Burgers? Check. Salads and sandwiches? Check. Friendly service? Check. And the beer? Well everything Adam brews is s slam dunk. Great new place.  5 stars easily."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Whenever I need a beer (when don't you?) I stop at McFate. The atmosphere is chill and relaxed, they have a dog friendly patio, service is always fast and on point. 

I've ate the pretzel, buffalo chicken wrap, mac & cheese, and pesto pasta. All of these were fantastic and full of flavor, plus good value for the price. All the dishes were really fresh and care goes into selecting the ingredients. This is one of those places where you need to try everything off the menu!!

Now for the drinks, Their Cucumber & Basil Bloody Mary is awesome!! its got some spice, so if you want mild tell them to dial it down, but I couldn't stop at just one. They have a fantastic hatch chili beer that is as smooth as silk that leaves a nice chili taste and a bit of spice on your tongue and their pilsner is spot on. They have some great craft cocktails and everyone I have ever been there with fins something they love.

Do yourself a favor and make the effort to stop in here, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying they have delicious beers. I definitely recommend getting a flight so you can try more beers while you are there. The pizza is awesome!! They also have some delicious apps!! Good atmosphere and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!! 
As for the brew, I personally wouldn't go out of my way to look out for them. \"Fateful IPA\" with over 100+ hops... bitter, but they did not do justice with as many hops as they had. They need to head to San Diego to see how it's done."}
{"text":"Heard from coworkers that this was a cool place to hang out. Had to check it out myself! Wings were pretty good, but the poutine was the best I've had. Michael was our server and he was very attentive and barely annoyed by all of my questions... lol. Had a great time will definately return."}
{"text":"This place a good brewery, period. Their food is meh. Service is pretty good. But what do you expect from a brewery?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place they have Moscow Mule's which are my baby lately amazing food great service indoor outdoor and a great group of people. Must come."}
{"text":"Very modern, industrial looking place with a nice patio.  They offered at least 12 beers and I tried 3, 2 IPAs and a sour orange beer.  They were all first rate.  I had a pizza that was quite nice also.  Everything was very tasteful."}
{"text":"If I could live here..... I would. Everyone that works here is awesome and they make you feel like part of the family (Vivian, Garrett, Maria, Amy, Ashley, and Jessie are awesome!!) that could basically be everyone, but you get the point. It's a good place, great food, delicious beer, and fantastic staff make this place a favorite. I highly recommend Fate to anyone who's looking for a good place to drink and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection
Unbelievable stone baked pizza
Top class service ! 
100% will be returning"}
{"text":"This place is so fun! Great food, interesting beers, chill vibes. 

My favorite thing on the menu is their nachos! Instead of refried beans, they use chili! I don't know why, but it works!!! Also, tried their habenero beer... oddly satisfying when paired with the nachos. 

It's usually always busy, but we've never had to wait for seating, which is really nice. They have tons of outdoor seating with a dog-friendly patio, and also comfy indoor booths and lots of tables. 

It's def a fun and lively place."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy the beers and food here. Great place to bring dogs and hang out in the patio. The food has great pairing."}
{"text":"Beer was good. Food, if you want to pay 11 bucks for a soggy bread sandwich I guess you could it was OK... Service, horrible. Sat at the bar, had to ask twice for beer because no one came to us... and when we ordered food we asked what they recommended they told us, Chicken Club, so we ordered that. When it came we asked for mustard and got a sigh from the bartender as if it was a chore to go and get it. Never got a check back, like no one asked if our food was ok.   Second time asking for beer took a while ... Different bartender man as if it was a chore for that too! She was bitter and not nice, didn't give us her name... Even the guy next to us said the service was bad.... I did not feel welcome here and will go back to Four Peaks as I do every time a new place tries too be like FOUR PEAKS, AGAIN! LOL oh btw tell the bar manager big arms and no legs,  he should pay attention..  his crew... Back massages on the job, how long do I wait for my beer before the massage is Over? On The job??? How long do I have to sit here watching my bartender get a back massage while I'm sitting here waiting for my beer? Come on?!??!?"}
{"text":"The beer at McFate was lousy and the service was too.  We stopped in McFate for a couple flights after hitting up another brewery and it was a big disappointment.  The bartender was miserable to see us and not friendly or helpful at all.  She gave us a couple of menus that looked like they were pulled out of the trash without a smile or kind word.

We ordered two flights with a little of everything.  Every beer looked the same, smelled the same, and damn near had the same color and taste.  I'm not sure what happened.  I've heard great things about this place.  

The building was nice, and the patio was pretty cool looking.  However, the bartender and the beers we had were all bad.  Maybe if they could get a friendlier bartender they could recommend better beers they offer?  Then again, if 6 of the beers we tried were not very good why would she serve them to begin with?  

There are many questions I could ask but we hurried up and paid and got out of there as we clearly weren't wanted and after the flights and service the feeling was mutual.  Won't come back or recommend at this point."}
{"text":"we were treated poorly - there is not equitable treatment for people of color - and the staff allowed piling on - it was pretty disconcerting."}
{"text":"Beer was good but food was cold and service wasn't that great. The building is awesome but the food and service needs help."}
{"text":"Three years later and I found myself back in the brewery. I think the same bartender was still there, but it wasn't a football night. No food tried, but the chicken fingers looked pretty good coming out, but otherwise the appetizers seemed a bit pricey. They still had their hatch green chile beer and on this visit, you could clearly taste those chiles. It was good, but more than one beer might give you heartburn. The one thing I enjoyed here was coming in through the back doors and walking past the tanks, but the sign said I had to walk around to the front door. It was a minor inconvenience, but a major deduction in my mind.

Oh yeah, it's $5.50 for a beer. They should always have a beer for $4."}
{"text":"This is a great place for craft beer and food.  I love their outdoor patio with great landscaping and the overall atmosphere is cool.  This is a great addition to south Scottsdale and highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great location, great atmosphere, great beer choices...the just need to engage their staff. They don't seem happy to be there. My husband and I have been to the new one in South Scottsdale twice with the same results and different days/times. They have THE best beer pretzel, EVER! We've only been to the one on Shea once. It is much smaller, but the staff seems happier, more engaged and laid back. Hoping the new one catches that vibe!  Best Wishes!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place, they have wonderful beer and really great food. The atmosphere is so enjoyable, and I particularly love the ahi tuna salad."}
{"text":"Went on a lovely lazy Saturday and chose to sit out on the patio since it was so nice.

The patio is nice, but a little noisy since it is right on the road.  But tolerable. There is also a cornhole spot to pass the time while sipping on some beer.  The only thing is some rude person took their dog to pee on the \"grass\".  

Service was mostly good.  The gal that took care of us was initially a little cold, but then warmed up through the afternoon and we had great fun.

Food was quite good.  The pizza with spicy honey was amazing.  I never thought to put honey on my pizza, but now it may be common!

The only reason I can't give it all 5 stars, is this place is supposed to be a brewery as its first purpose.  The beer was really not that great.  I tried three different ones and they were good, but not AZ Wilderness good.  The sour was the most disappointing because it was boring and flat.

I still would come back - mostly for that pizza!!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunches, Pablo Honey pizza and Maui Chicken Salad were great!  Cool decor, patio and outside bar, perfect number of TVs for a micro brewery.  And of course the beers are the best."}
{"text":"We live walking distance from Fate and were so excited for the opening but I have to say I was pretty disappointed. The interior was nice and brewery aspect of it was cool but the food really fell short. You can tell that this place was built primarily as a brewery and the food was an afterthought. It wasn't bad but just kind of Meh....The best way to put it is that in a town where $10 hamburgers are a dime a dozen this particular $10 hamburger would not be my first pick. Same applies with the pizza, I think I would have been equally satisfied with the $3 Red Barron Pizza in my Freezer. Everything lacked finesse and just seemed rather generic. My one suggestion which could really change my entire perception of his place is to hire a chef that knows what they are doing that can help elevate the menu and quality of food."}
{"text":"Management reached out and made things right.  Our second visit was great.  Thanks again."}
{"text":"Being the beer nerd that I am, I had to try out some local breweries during my stay.  After doing a little research, I wanted to try out McFate as they have two locations...so that makes them a little more legit, right?

On a Friday evening, it was pretty busy as they serve food there, plus an out door patio and bar.  

I ordered a couple of flights. You get three samples for a little over $6. It was pretty hard to choose, as they must of had 20 different beers.  The staff made some recommendations or at least was able to describe what the beers tasted like. My favorites were the Craison (cranberry sour), a triple oatmeal IPA, a session IPA, and a gingerbread stout.  Boy that oatmeal IPA was smooth!  You could barely tell it was a triple IPA."}
{"text":"Monday night 5 dollar pizzas and hockey! Can't go wrong there! Place was real lively for a Monday and thoroughly enjoyed the Vienna lager! Nice work team!! 

Gonna be back and ready to catch some more games and brews!"}
{"text":"Beer Cheers to Andrew \"Dude\" C. leader of the UYE Brews Cruise for coordinating the meet up at Fate Brewing Company, for without him I don't know if fate alone would have brought me here.
I started our brews cruise with the Oh my Gatos Hatch Chile Cream Ale, it had a light aroma and flavor of green chili without the heat. I'm an AZ gal and could've handled some heat but it was still the group's and my favorite!
   I continued the cruise by tasting my friend's Fate-Ality IPA which claims to have an irresponsible amount of hops and does not disappoint,  if hops is your thing this brew is for you...but any more for me and I would have been sunk!
   But why stop there I had to keep the beer theme flowing, so I ordered the BBC starter, beer battered chicken and sweet potato fries on the side. It was enough to keep me afloat with good flavor and plenty to share with the crew.
   My brews cruise mates ordered the Grape Escape pizza and as always were kind enough to share. It was topped with garlic oil, mozzarella, roasted grapes, goat cheese, rosemary, balsamic glaze and caused me to have food envy, don't you hate it when that happens!? I'll be back to get one of my own! 
As fate would have it, we ended the night there or it would have been Uber taking me home. 
If you're into good brew and food, then cruise on over to Fate Brewing!
 Happy Yelping and Eating! :) Cheers!

{"text":"Great indoor/outdoor microbrewery in south Scottsdale.  Play bags outside, sit at the bar, or the booths indoors.  Nice variety of brews including my favorite the candy bar milk stout!  Guest beers as well. The food is standard bar food burgers, salad, snacks, and pizza. It's all good!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. I walk in and sat at the bar, greeted briefly and then asked what I wanted to order. This was the last time anyone said anything to me until I was given my credit card slip after it was charged. I had a Fatality beer which was mediocre at best, Swiss Mushroom Burger with Bacon which was ok, not a lot of flavor on the burger itself. Tater Tots were great. I would not suggest this place to anyone wanting to go to a sports bar/brewery and wanting some interaction with any of the bar tenders, it would have been nice if someone asked how my burger was or even if I liked the beer. Luckily I still tipped the bar tender that really didn't do his job. This will follow the rule of 25, where I will end up telling 25 people about the poor service and then each of them will tell 25. Thank you but no thank you, I will never visit this brewery again."}
{"text":"Great service, beer selection was good and the server helped with suggestions. Very attentive staff and the apps were great. My burger(garlic/mushroom) was bland, but would likely return when visiting again and try something else."}
{"text":"The Barrel Room is an excellent space for a special event - we just had another successful evening there and can report the service was exceptional.  Mike is an insightful planner. The servers are gracious and hardworking - on top of every detail. The full bar is a great benefit when you have a broad array of guests. It was a pleasure to share an important evening in their care.  They have a confident calm that they back up with great beer, favored food offerings and comfortable atmosphere.  The greatest compliment is that we will be back next year."}
{"text":"Mcfate is a good brewery with a great selection of beers on tap. I think there were at least 15 of their beers available on top which is pretty remarkable. There's lots of indoor seating as well as indoor and outdoor bar seating and a large patio area. The only downside to the patio is that there's a lot of road traffic from Scottsdale Road. The food is good and the service was prompt and accurate."}
{"text":"Freaking love this bar/restaurant!  Great staff and great food, amazing beers! Must try for south Scottsdale.  Outdoor atmosphere is great when the weather is nice! Vivian is an my favorite bartender!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were here last weekend. He ordered a burger and I ordered a salad. After a few bites I noticed a large bug in my salad. I alerted the bartender (we were at the bar) and she grabbed my plate and tossed it and started to put in another order. I told her I definitely did not want another salad and that I just wanted it taken off of our bill, which she did. We told the manager what happened as he passed by the bar and he literally said, \"yeah I heard there was a bug in your salad\" .... and he walked away.

I know stuff happens, I wasn't upset, but I thought it was handled really poorly. No offer to buy a round of beers or anything. They just closed us out as if nothing had happened. We decided after that we wouldn't be back. There are too many other great places and the service here is not great."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks. Some of the servers and bar tenders need a crash course in serving etiquette. Sean (or Shawn) the bar tender was amazing though, promote that man."}
{"text":"Thank you! We loved it!!! Beautiful night and we enjoyed a few seats around the outside bar. Food was good. I can't speak for the beer, as I had a glass of wine, (which was \"smallish) in my opinion, but my husband enjoyed the beer and there were MANY to choose from. We ate at the bar because it was the only place to go, and the service there was very friendly! Only thing that bothered me was being told an outrageous wait time for a table, then seeing lots of table sit empty for TOOOO long. I'm not a fan of places holding tons of reservations open for people who aren't THERE. People don't show up on time? Tables are GONE to others who ARE there.  We met a nice couple who was told 20 minutes. An hour later, with their baby...they were still waiting. That's not right. Seems like the \"getting people seated,\" is the only thing that I thought needed work. Loved the atmosphere and love having a fun place in South Scottsdale!  Will we go back? Absolutely."}
{"text":"I have this place a second chance after last having visited over 6 months ago. When I last visited the food was not great and beer subpar. The atmosphere has completely changed since my last visit and they had a much better selection of drinks on their menu. The appetizers we had were also a step in the right direction. I am happy for the neighborhood that this spot has become more lively and is serving a better product."}
{"text":"I really REALLY want to give this place more stars, but I can't. We have been there 4 times now and each time was underwhelming. We enjoy Fate North, so we were pumped when South opened! But South's food is basic - I feel like I could get the same in the frozen section at Costco - and the service is horrendous. We waited over 15 minutes for a server to even say hello, our glasses were constantly empty, waited 15 to get a check with empty plates/glasses, and another 10 minutes for the waiter to even pick up the check to run our cards. Luckily, we spoke with the manager and he was very nice and apologized. I doubt we will be going back to Fate South very often. I'd much prefer North, even though it's much farther for us and smaller."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a party of 30. They expected a group of 30 with women that are pregnant to sit outside with 110 plus weather. Don't plan on a group event here. They will not honor there reservation."}
{"text":"I will give McFate's a 4 star rating - which is what it is averaging on Yelp.  We sat outside on my visit in the early evening and it was a great vibe and atmosphere.  Service was efficient, and better than average.  I was in for beers and appetizers with some work colleagues earlier this week and we had a good time.  The beer was especially good and was the highlight for me.  We ordered some guacamole and chips and some poutine as appetizers.  The appetizers were good.  I would rate the poutine as a little sub par - but I am likely a tough grader for poutine.  Growing up in New England, we are pretty close to Quebec ... and no one does poutine better than the Quebecois.  Anyway, I would be happy to go back to McFate's anytime for more of their delicious beer and I am sure other solid items on their menu.  Cheers."}
{"text":"I'm in it for the Yoga. Yes, you heard me right. McFate has a Yoga + Beer event EVERY Sunday morning. For only $10 you get an hour long yoga class in the Barrel Room AND a beer at the bar afterwards. Yoga and booze, two of my favorite things! Seriously, I live in HAWAII and I try to make it to this class every single time I am back in PHX, it's just that awesome.
The instructor leads a kick-a$$ yoga class that will get you sweaty, loose, and THIRSTY. Hang on to your receipt and present at the bar for your free beer! They're always brewing something new and the bartenders are knowledgable about their product. We always manage to work up an appetite and their appetizer selection in great. 
So get your girls (or your guys!) and a good 'ol Alexander Hamilton, and start your Sunday Funday off right!!"}
{"text":"One of the best breweries I have ever been to. I have been to many breweries and this is by far my favorite. The staff is so gracious, hospitable, friendly, genuine and quick. I spend a majority of my visits at the bar and they are always great. They make great recommendations, are knowledgeable, kind and attentive. The food is amazing!! Love the Ruben, the BBC, Pablo honey pizza, the farm salad with steak and so many more. The ever changing beer selection is one of the best around. I love any new beer they put out. The fatality, fateful, and any other IPA they roll out has never disappointed. I have met the owner and other management and was pleasantly surprised. Its always nice to see how involved a management team is with their customers and staff. If you are going to try any brewery in the area, make sure Mcfate is on your list of stops. It will go above and beyond your expectations!!"}
{"text":"In a land of aspiring craft brewers, McFate has the recipe to success down pat. I was so happy that a second location opened up. This location has a more comprehensive menu than Fate North on Shea. 

I've had almost every beer on the menu and they are all fantastic! My favorites include the shift pint, candy bar stout, double oatmeal IPA, and fatality. It does rotate so your options can change daily.

The food is fantastic! I often order the Pablo Honey with no meat. I crave this pizza. After a long road trip my boyfriend and I find ourselves grabbing one to go on our way home. There's nothing like it anywhere! 

Another item I've chosen was the fish sandwich. It's perfect. Two fish sticks on a light bun. It's not as greasy as most fish sandwiches. Totally hits the spot. Their sides include cottage cheese (personal favorite - I was excited to see this!), sweet potato fries (addicting), tater tots (yes please), a side salad (it's quite large for a side), and regular julienned-style fries. 

They have a veggie burger and gluten free options for those with dietary restrictions. Don't forget to try the desserts! I hope they cater weddings because their desserts are one of a kind. 

The service is excellent. The manager, Brandon, always greets us as if we lived there...which we kind of do? But that's a story for another time. He's great! He knows his beer. 

Definitely a place to catch the game and enjoy quality food. I love Fate!"}
{"text":"My name is Pamela and I am the owner of Awakening Nu Energy.  I know what it takes to make my clients happy and I can state from experience that the care and attention my friend and I got from the waitress was stupendous.  We got samples of different beer choices before we choose the one that suited us.  They were all so yummy!  We both settled on the Irish Red to have with lunch.  The chef was off the hook with the hamburger I had.  It was so juicy and the mushrooms added an extra flavor that left my mouth watering for more.  Never have I laughed so much in a long long time.  It was a great obedience to be in.  I will be sure to make it a point to go back.   Thank you for such a good time last Tuesday afternoon."}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of Yelpers on a Friday night and was SO impressed with the beer, food, service, everything! I ordered the Hatch Chile Gatos and honestly, couldn't get enough! It was SO tasty...and different! For food, my boyfriend and I split the pretzel and cheese (I can never resist this!) and I got the Caesar Salad w/buffalo chicken. It was SO yum! We will absolutely be back soon. It's wide open space makes it a GREAT place for large groups. Birthday party anyone? Thank you for being so awesome, Fate team!"}
{"text":"I live close to Fate and am thankful they are in our neighborhood, however walking by and dining here are two very different experiences. First, we ordered two gluten free pizzas and when they came out, one looked completely different then the other. The server said it was because of their size but the one looked maybe an inch smaller. I sent them both back (the one that actually looked gf had mushrooms which I didn't order). Then, someone else came out to apologize and said that the one was indeed not gf and they were sorry, and would buy our pizzas for us, very nice. They came back out and were pretty good. I do think it's terrible though that if I wouldn't have said something, I would have spent the night super sick. Also, we parked out daughter's tricycle inside the back door so we wouldn't need to mess with it or have it in anyone's way in the restaurant. She had a little lantern on her bike that we left as well. After we were done eating, someone had stolen the lantern. Crazy! The hostess who sat us also argued with me back and forth about how the grass on the lawn was real and not fake, even though we've rolled around and played in it many times. She wouldn't stop until she went over and felt that it was indeed plastic. Service was slow as well."}
{"text":"We stumbled in here looking for an appetizer.  The service was amazing and the hummus was delicious.  The kids cheese pizza was huge, both my daughters split one and we even brought two pieces home with us.  We most definitely will be going back for a full meal!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great dog friendly patio. Staff are wonderful and food is delicious. Lots of variety of food and drinks. I would recommend any of the pizzas! Also I like how you can order flights of beer to sample new ones. Cool spot in South Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"Talk about BAD service. I was prettty excited to try this brewery for the first time. Everything's still looks pretty clean and new. But service killed my experience. 

The hostess took about 10 minutes to fully clean off our table. She would clean a bit, walk away and walk around, clean a little bit and so forth. Our apparent server came up to her while she was cleaning our table and said in front of us, Only Two, and then walked away - no introduction, didn't bring waters, nothing.  He came up a couple minutes later and immediately said what are drinking but this guy was giving off some bad energy and had a huge attitude!! Maybe it's because he is a ginger with Rick James' long jheri curl wearing a stupid headband...But who knows.. However he SUCKED. He had zero patience, attitude galore, would disappear, made us feel very uncomfortable as consumers and gave a little to none insight on their beer.  Look dude its called a job, a job you signed up for, do your job with a smile. 

Needless to say I will not be going back. And everyone who loves craft beer as much as I do will know not to go there either."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, and welcoming these out-of-towners. Thanks Steve for making us feel at home. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Couldn't have executed a better second location. This beer is unmatched, and will consistently blow your mind. 

The pizza holds up to fate north and they did a great job with the rest of the menu. Try the roasted grape salad and make sure you get a taste of the hot oil aioli. Still have never had a better beer cheese and pretzel. 

Just an all around fantastic spot to spend your time drinking incredible beer and delicious food. Do yourself a favor and just go there, often.

FATE 4 LIFE"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with good food. The jess is my fav pizza here and the grape pizza was very unique but worked!"}
{"text":"We just made a trip to the Scottsdale Mc Fate for brunch, compliments of the management!!! A couple of weeks ago we went to the North location and found it closed, even though the website and phone message said they were open at 11 on Sunday.  I sent a note to them and the same day got a reply back with an apology and offer to comp us at the Scottsdale location
Great customer service from them and shows that they really care about their clientele.  The food was excellent, salmon florentine Benedict was perfect, the house made Hollandaise and salsa were tasty and fresh, the Hatch Chile Gatos beer was a great compliment, and the server, was a lovely fresh and beautiful face.  Overall everything could not have been better.
Potatoes were yummy too! Hugo took good care of us and I know Mc Fate will be one of our regular places. And even though our breakfast was a gift, we tipped well!"}
{"text":"Complements on the food from all around the table including those who had sandwiches, salads, wings and my personal choice the Peggy-Rita (Margarita Pizza) which stuck to tradition with fresh ingredients and nothing else.   The group I was with are far from beer connoisseurs so I won't read into the general consensus that the beer was good, I did not sample any."}
{"text":"I got the kids pizza which is as big as the normal pizza so definitely a good deal. Also the salmon is very recommended"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I found this restaurant randomly as we were looking for a place to have lunch before a client meeting. It was bright, and we were sat down immediately. We didn't have a lot of time to eat and we were served quickly. I had the salmon and it was bomb! My coworkers had the maui salad. All enjoyed their food. I would definitely try their brews if I wasn't going here before a client meeting!"}
{"text":"Cool place - friendly staff - good server - good local beer selection (Fate and other local brews).

The pretzel appetizer was really good - the crust was just the right amount of toughness - the inside soft  - good flavor.  Both the beer/cheese and the spicy mustard dipping sauces were good.

Ordered the Fire Burger - meh.  First of all - it's a 'smashed' burger, which apparently means it can only be cooked to within an inch of its life (well done) - ruins the taste of the beef.  (I tried to order it medium rare - no go).  The jalapeños were the only taste beside the onion and salt.  Kind of like a Five Guys burger, only less so.  Sweet potato fries were good.

It'd be at least 4 stars if not for the disappointment that was called \"Fire Burger\".
Might try it again and order something else?"}
{"text":"Very nice brewery with interesting craft beers. We tired the hatch chile gatos and orangedale sour. Loved them both. Very unique flavor and I'm not a beer guru by any means. 

Happy hour was nice, with discount for beer and food. Pretty good food in general. Hummus app was good enough  and they gave us extra veggies for dipping. We ordered the bison pasta dish and it was a nice heart plate. The grape goat cheese pizza was a bit on the sweet side. Even though it wasn't wood fired it was crispy all the way through. 

Liked the outdoor and indoor feel of the bar area. Inside/outside bar pretty cool. Two Little fire places out in the patio. Fake grass area over on one side with a cornhole  game to entertain yourself.  High tops and low tables all around."}
{"text":"I use to go to McFate brewery once a week sometimes more. Within the last couple months they changed the menu including their beer. Keep in mind this used to be my absolute favorite place to go. The quality of the food has gone straight downhill. And my visit tonight... the beer also has gone down the tubes. I am really disgusted at the direction the food and beer are going with Mc fate brewery."}
{"text":"Great spot. I had been meaning to stop in for quite some time and finally did. Had the hatch chili beer and it was so good. Food is great, and the service is good."}
{"text":"Came over for some beer and appetizers.  This place is great to watch a game or hang out with friends.  They can seat large groups or smaller ones.  The place is casual with lots of beer options.  
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Beer is great. Food is good--not outstanding, but good. Service is friendly. The red head with the tatted neck who 'greets' guests at the door has to go. The attitude is beyond her status--she's not that cool. She's just rude. She may be a homophobe too."}
{"text":"My only regret was I couldn't stay longer! (And they were out of the brew I wanted - must be a popular choice!) 

We visited Fate Brewing from the recommendation of a local beer distributor we ran into at lunch in Old Town. He was right on the mark with a great brewery for atmosphere and refreshing beer!  

We had a flight of 6 Fate Brews and a relaxing afternoon in the Patio. There is definitely a brew for everyone, though I was disappointed that the true experimental brews were either out of season or not Fate-brewed beer. 

Didn't eat, but all the dishes around me made me sad I wasn't hungry enough to partake! Would definitely go back to taste more brews and food!"}
{"text":"Fate Brewery has a great neighborhood feel that has really been lacking in South Scottsdale.  It is a great option for craft brew lovers and offers a more relaxing feel from the traditional Old Town bars.  Love the patio in the evening and the openness around the bar is very inviting.  

The beer flight is a great way to try a lot of unique stouts, lagers, and IPA's for not much coin.  I was blown out of my chair to see one of their rotating crafts from my hometown of Bloomington, IL produced by Destihl Brewery on tap (what are the chances!).  Offering other unique small batch rotational beers from around the US is a very nice touch and keeps everything fresh!

Whether you need a change of pace or looking for a new favorite spot Fate is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I really hate to be the one who leaves the first bad review for this place. Wife and I had been looking forward to going here since we saw the opening date. 
Decided to go and celebrate her birthday there on 8/25. When we arrived it was pretty busy which wasn't a surprise. We made our way to the hostess stand and were told it would be a 30 min wait.
Usually we would leave if given a wait more than 15 min but said what the heck lets go to the open seating bar area and have a few beers while we wait. We went to the outside bar and sat down. 
We sat there literally 20 minutes and no one came for our order. They seemed to be taking everyone else's order around us but missed is completely. We ended up 
Leaving after 25 minutes. I doubt I would ever go back.
Have been to the north location and it was great. 
we ended up settling for yard house."}
{"text":"Okay, for starters I know this is a new establishment and it will take time for the business to work out it's kinks. First, there was a bar tender by the name of Isaac that was very nice and efficient; however the place was busy and he was not receiving help from the other bartender or manager.
Then after we went to our table the waitresses were constantly interrupting our conversations to take our menus; seriously paper menus and you don't have enough?! Next, we needed to flag down wait staff to order additional drinks and we waited to get our bill.
I do want to say the facility looked clean and was in our neighborhood, so we will probably go back. I feel that it was probably under staffed or the staff that was there was not working as a team.
I hope it improves."}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 here on a Saturday evening. The main dining room wasn't full & neither was the patio (where we sat). The service was terrible - no one can to our table until a member of our party asked after about 20 minutes of waiting. Our server was then sour & not the least bit friendly. Food was only ok and several members of our party enjoyed the beer. 

Super disappointed as the location is great & the atmosphere is fun. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The women's restroom does smell very good though.

Food is okay, I LOVED their nachos when I first had them.  Beer is okay too.

Sat at the bar both times to watch the DBacks game, which they turned on for us at our request.

It's walking distance from where I live."}
{"text":"Poor management/ customer service. Uncomfortable poorly maintained chairs. No happy hour food."}
{"text":"Looked like a cool place. Unfortunately the food was not good. Seemed like the food was sitting for a bit before it was brought to table. Chicken was not added to the pasta until server brought over a side of chicken in a cup/ bowl. Took a long time before server came to get order. It just seems like there was not enough help at first. 

The worst part about it all was the flys. As soon as our food was brought out to us, we were attacked by flys. The server seemed irritated and told us we can move if we want but said they were everywhere. We eventually moved to another table. A manager never came to the table to talked to us and see if we were ok. It may have been just a bad time to come in. I just felt that someone should have apologized that we had to move and pick our own table. 

The service was not good and the flys defiantly made the whole experience even worse. 

I hope things get better for them. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Another delicious sandwich was added to the McFate menu, Ribeye Steak Sandwich, it was amazing!!   Side of coleslaw!!  I paired it with the Blue Eyed Blonde, and we ate at the bar.  Vince was taking care of us, always treats us well!   

The place was packed and the beers, food & service were 5 star!!!!

Thanks Team McFate for landing in South Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"Wanna try some tasty beers you may not be able to get many other places? What about some collaboration beers made by some of the valley's best? I suggest you check thisnplace out and I'll be sure to hook you up with why...

The seating here is nice for a night out with your buds or for a date. There is plenty of room and even a private room for events (maybe my husband's bday party). When we have our amazing AZ weather, you can sit on thier patio as well. 

I've tried a few pretty tasty need here. I recall one aged in whiskey barrels that made me quite happy! The colab beers are fun too; it's nice to see what some amazing local brewers can dream up together. They do  too, so if you're not sure if have a few you know you wanna try, I suggest that. 

As for food....I know this sounds bananas, but try the chicken tenders. I don't what kind of magic they use to make them, but they melt in your mouth. They come with fries that I wish were hand cut, but given the yummy beer, I'll forgive them"}
{"text":"Nice place. Been here before for a quick drink. Was in the neighborhood,  so here again for another quick round. The weather is nice out, they have to patio open. I am having the Irish Red. Last time I had the Buena Vista Blonde Ale. Both are tasty."}
{"text":"My husband and I love McFate; we seem to go at least once each week. The vibe is amazing, especially if it's nice enough outside to sit on the patio. The servers are always knowledgeable and fast. The food is fresh, and you can taste it. I usually get the farmhouse salad, and my husband gets the club. The meat is outstanding on both, as are all ingredients. It looks like McFate is connected to Plato's closet, but don't let that deter you from stopping into this gem. It's hands down my favorite place since moving to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Came here after a spring training game yesterday. The overall vibe of the place is great - there's an outdoor seating area and an indoor seating area. Feels like a fun place to be. We sat outside. The beer really was fantastic - we tried one of the IPAs and the nut brown beer. Unfortunately, that's where the pluses ended for me. The service was not slow or anything, but our server had a crappy attitude, and she just was not welcoming at all. The food was okay. We had a pizza, grilled cheese, and buffalo chicken wrap between the four of us, and everyone said their food was \"okay\". The location is great, the vibe of the place is great, the beer is great. If they can get their servers and kitchen staff on board, this could be a five star place."}
{"text":"Based on where I had to park I figured it would be wall-to-wall packed, but thankfully it was not. I found a great spot at the bar and a perfect view of the TV (Olympics skiing!). All the bartenders were great I was checked on regularly and they knew their beers.

Speaking of beer I came here to specifically try their Fatality IPA. A colleague talked this beer up and had me drooling. At 100 plus IBUs you would think it would be bitter but I found it to be rather smooth. It has a kick so be careful. Dinner was perfectly battered fish sandwich with a side of salted sweet fries. Seeing this locale is about 10 minutes from my house I'll be back to try their other beers and experience their great service. An easy 5-star review."}
{"text":"Not super impressed. Was very excited to try this place out, atmosphere is excellent, service was excellent , food is mediocre, beer is mediocre. They have the styles of beer  I like but they just aren't that great, and they are sort of expensive @ 5 bucks a pint also they do not have pitchers:(. The food was trying too hard to be fancy and I didn't care for it, had some fancy pizza thing and it wasn't really that great.
Three stars, I'll give it a shot again, maybe try something else on the menu.."}
{"text":"Decent beer, good wait staff, very cool atmosphere and vibe. I waivered between 3 or 4 stars. Overall a decent place"}
{"text":"Decent service. The beer I had was good. The food was super bland and uninspired. I told the server which I usually don't, she said we should have had something else. The manager came over we were just honest with him. I ate my salad because I was hungry my wife ate about a third of hers. They seemed shocked that we didn't like the food. It's a nice looking place and I think they mean well. Perhaps a new chef."}
{"text":"This brewery is so chill and laid back. I'm from Chico, CA and grew up on Sierra Nevada. McFate is just as good but not gonna lie their food is better too :)  Everyone is nice and hardly drama among the staff which is a plus, given that I've worked in high end restaurants. Key lime pie is delicious for dessert and you can get a whole in a advance. Try honey with your tots next time promise you'll be amazed."}
{"text":"WOW. I've never been here before, but my good friend Cassie Ratekin used to work at the Shea location. I have tried some Fate Brews before but I have never actually set foot in a location.

$5 amazing, incredibly delicious in house brewed beers. that's insane. these guys are truly showing up staple breweries like four Peaks and santan. not only do I prefer Fate, but I'm stoked to try the milk chocolate porter. I got to try all of the beers and I was very impressed.

Our server did an awesome job too! he said it was his first night serving there. I want to say his name was Nick, but I'm not entirely sure. either way I will be back."}
{"text":"Super tasty wings and a private event room that will host your entire office. Steve McFate is an ASU alum and a great guy. Check out their seasonal offerings and enjoy the atmosphere. Dog friendly too!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just yum! We left still thinking about our orders!  my husband and I tried the sausage pizza & chicken club sandwich with sweet potato fries. He had the grape of throne & the pale down unda and I had the Irish red.
The fries were lightly salted, the size was perfect - not shoe string or wedges and just the right amount of soft crunch.
The club sandwich is what took the spotlight! The chicken was juicy and no condiments were needed at all. It wasn't a big chunk of meat - it was thin grilled just perfectly. The sourdough bread was toasted and buttered just right, nice & golden and soft yet, toasty. The bread soaked up the delicious chicken juices but still kept the buttery edges the right amount of crunch.
The pizza had a delicious and generous red sauce that had a smalllll hint of sweetness but still a good salty paired with the spicy sausage.
We ordered wings to go too! Can't wait to come back and try something else although we feel the sandwich is worth being a regular order. 
Portions are decent for the price too. 
:)"}
{"text":"Phenomenal brewery! Beer is incredible; food is incredible. Paige was a fantastic server - timely and had great suggestions for both food and beer. Highly recommend this place - outstanding in every way. Paige heard me mention that they should sell kegs and asked Hugo who is a manager to stop by our table. He gave me a card and said to give a call because they were more than happy to fill my kegerator. Very happy with our experience!"}
{"text":"Both incredible beer and food. The tacos that I had were just beyond good. The sides were all good as well and everyone I was with loved their burgers and sandwiches. I believe that I liked every beer that I tried all the way from the lager to Shot in the Arm (which is the best BA Arizona Stout that be ever tried). The service was friendly and we got seated faster than expected. The interior is beautiful as well."}
{"text":"What a great new addition to the neighborhood! Although I am bias as I love good beer as you see from my other reviews.  They have a great space situated near Scottsdale and McDowell.  They have a great indoor area with a big bar and plenty of big tables with views into the tank room and tvs.  Then the bar extends out to the great patio with a bunch of seating and a \"grass\" area for bags and other games.  Food is really good I have tried several items all were good but especially their burgers.  Beer list is always in rotation and there is a new beer of theirs almost every time I go so unlike other brewers in town that might have a seasonal they are really brewing different stuff all the time. They also get creative, and although some are not to my taste, some are home runs, and as a beer nerd its about the craft and trying new things to broaden the pallet.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and I have had some really go times due to the server are bar tender going the extra mile or nerding out talking beer.

As I mentioned I have been there multiple times from day one as I live in the neighborhood, the reasoning behind the 5 star rating which I don't give lightly is as follows.  They have a good atmosphere, and they cater to the area they are in, while providing a great experience and food.  I took a group of 18 for my birthday where they really took the time to go above and beyond. I even asked for a quick sneak peek tour, and they not only did that but went one step further.  They did a small sampling of an upcoming brew which was a great birthday gift and a fun behind the scene experience for the couple friends that joined me.  The reason they received that 5th star mainly hinges on the passionate staff and the highly involved owner. I don't judge a business on how they handle things when they go right but on how they handle things when they go wrong and that's whats for a good restaurant I can recommend to friends, family and fellow yelpers.  As we had a few speed bumps my first visit (opening day), they responded to my comments and went above an beyond, to make the experience for everyone a great one ever since.  Thank you and Cheers!"}
{"text":"We went to McFate for a large event for the AZ Dragon Boat festival. I don't think this place was necessarily equipped to deal with the volume of people that were at the event. The outdoor patio here is a really nice space, and I would certainly go back to see what it's like when there aren't 150 rowdy paddlers around.

My pal and I had the spinach dip, which was pretty good. I had a flight, but the beers in the flight weren't the ones I had asked for, so that could have maybe been better. 

At the end of the night they had lost our bills, so the server didn't make us pay (we tried to though, I swear!)"}
{"text":"I like this spot!

The food is great, everything I have tried showed care and great effort.

The beer brewed here is amazing and there is a great selection.

It is not the cheapest spot in town, but prices are fare.

I'm not a regular, and there are plenty, but service is always great, no matter who you know.

It's a beautiful compound and well maintained.

It's defiantly worth the stop, grab a few pints or goblets and a bite, all are yummy!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and there's more good than bad but I'll start with the one bad: the chairs. The chairs are absolutely awful here, if the food wasn't as great as it is I wouldn't come here because the chairs are that awful.

Now the good! The appetizers are all great, especially the beer battered chicken. The chicken may be the most consistent menu item I've ever gotten from any restaurant. Every time I've gotten them they're crispy and juicy, seriously these are the best chicken tenders I've ever had by a mile! The beer selection is solid too and always interesting.

On my last visit, which was on 3/1/2018, I left my hat at my table and a hostess ran out to bring it to me. Unfortunately I didn't catch her name (she is short with box braids, so management if she sounds familiar please give her props) but I really appreciated her coming out to give it to me. McFate is my favorite brewery in the sea of breweries in the valley!"}
{"text":"Painfully long wait to receive my order which was very much not good at all. There are too many other reliably great places in town to bother trying this place again."}
{"text":"Hostess was a bit off, maybe having a bad day? 
But the rest of the staff was really helpful and kind! I looooved the buffalo chicken wrap and sweet potato fries! But my fiancé wasn't a fan of his fate burger -- he said it was dry. 
We sat outside and enjoyed the vibe, although the benches were a bit uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I've been to Fate a handful of times and I'm never been disappointed. They have a great beer selection and they satisfy my IPA requirements (love the Fate-ality IPA). The restaurant has a good vibe; I enjoy having dinner at the bar and on the outside patio. The food is good and reasonably priced, staff very pleasant, plus there is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"The best thing about this brewery is that it is dog friendly.  They brought Alley a big bowel of water despite her small travel bowl being filled. 
The beers were all a bit harsh except for the coffee milk stout and the cucumber beer, which wasn't theirs.   I did not like after taste bite on the other four I got.  The server was attentive and personable."}
{"text":"The food here is way better than expected for a brewery. Beer is amazing as always. Service was a little slow last night but they were busy. Wish the other staff we made eye contact with trying to get help would have stepped up and asked if we needed anything. Other than that, we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was okay but the service was not the best.. overall, it's okay. If you're trying to decide between a couple of places, I'd say Four Peaks is better than this one."}
{"text":"The first time I heard of Fate Brewery was maybe a year ago. Then I was introduced to Fate by some co-workers one day for lunch. Today, we were back for lunch and I realized how foolish I've been in neglecting (my) Fate.

I am speaking of the newer, southern location which opened last fall on Scottsdale Road just south of McDowell. Fate is the closest brewery to my home and I'm okay with that. Because of the handful of beers I've sampled, I am eager to bring friends along to try the others.

It looks as if the menu has been updated or expanded. My co-workers didn't remember having as many options from previous visits. Plus, the number of beer options has grown and changed (seasonally) which is always a good sign. Personally, I love seeing a brewery that also has a decent sampling of the competition. It's another beer celebration! And it shows the brewers confidence.

The only reason I didn't give Fate five stars, is due to my limited lunch visits. The food is so much better than common bar fare. My Fate Burger was simply amazing! However, lunch isn't the best way to judge a brewery for its atmosphere. I shall have to return one evening for a proper sampling of the beers I didn't get to try at lunch.

\"It's in your hands\" (says the bright red truck outside). Right now, I want a glass of Double Oat IPA in my hands! Salud!"}
{"text":"$6 flight with 3 choices! Decent sized menu with something for everyone. The Truff Driver was pretty amazing and made for great leftovers the next day! Our server was training but did a great job. I felt that the server and trainer came to check in enough but not too much! Restaurant and restrooms were clean. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Okay.. I grew up in Boulder, and just got into town from Albuquerque. I am used to exceptional beer and great breweries. This is that. My new Office?"}
{"text":"MBC had a nice selection and variety of beers. Their sandwiches are outstanding and service was great!"}
{"text":"We've had better: My boyfriend and I went to the original location first and it was awesome!!! David was a cool guy and we had one drink but, we wanted more then just pizza so, we checked out this location and our service was terrible no personality and just bland couldn't tell you her name because she didn't talk. Another girl we asked for a sauce she rolled her eyes at us. The food was good! But, service was terrible. Me and my boyfriend have both worked in the industry for 12 years and for how much money we spent I feel we deserved better. You want better servers who know what they're doing give us a call. Still tipped 20% always tip your servers."}
{"text":"My family comes here often - delicious food, quick and pleasant service and a fun atmosphere with great beer! Our favorite is the Chile Gatos beer and the Jess Pizza

If you're looking for a server to really take care of you and make this the most positive experience, ask for Kendyl! We had her tonight and she is by far our favorite server here"}
{"text":"One of our favorites breweries in the valley!! They have complex beers - not just your typical run of the mill. Food is delicious, service is good and love the vibe"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, high quality beer, and a fantastic environment/location."}
{"text":"Awesome brewery atmosphere with a great craft brew selection. If you're looking for an appetizer, you can't go wrong with the buffalo wings! Also, ask for what they have on draft currently. It rotates often."}
{"text":"The burgers and hummus were both delicious. The service was fantastic. Beers were great and hoppy. There was an odd smell that wafted throughout the restaurant but overall the dining experience was great. The music was classic and created an awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"There were not enough staff for the lunch rush- it took forever to order the food. However, when our food finally came it was delicious and the portions were huge. It was a little pricey, but I'd say it's worth it. The beer was delicious and obviously they have a great beer selection."}
{"text":"Yummy beer, great food, fun staff, and nice people to chat with.  It's the time of the season where the glass walls are open and the bar opens to the patio.  

Scott and I just shared the Alaskan sandwich with tater tots and oh my goodness it was amazing.  Ordered a side of mango coleslaw and I gotta say I'm not a huge fan of mango but that cold so I was to die for.

Had the Maillard de Garde IPA and I've got to say I'm a huge fan absolutely tasty with a fine fine fine after effect ;).  Don't wait stop by well worth the visit."}
{"text":"I'm learning my beer palate isn't quite up to or with my wine, cocktail and food palate. I have a hard time telling why good beer and bad beer is. Most of its preference to me at this point.

With that being said we came here on Memorial Day and it was surprisingly slow.  I felt that last year the restaurant/bar world was busier on this weekend. I'm guessing it's because school has been out for a couple weeks now and people have finally left the valley. But score for us. Great friendly service, ample room for the kiddo to run around and explore. Their are cornhole bags and a beautiful outside bar. The inside was slightly busier with a beautiful view of their brewing facility. 

Had the most popular ipa, the hef, a pale ale and a porter. All were solid choices. Served I. Proper glassware and complimented by fatness of quest, guac, garlic burger and snacks of my partners plate. The kiddo nibbled here and there. The salsa had a bit of chipotle and was a nice change and compliment with the ipa to start off with. 

I'm saying, come here. Enjoy yourself and have a good time."}
{"text":"I had a rocky start my first time coming here, but this is really a great place that I will continue to come back to.

One of my favorite parts about McFate is their outdoor patio. My wife and I have a dog who has separation anxiety (well, maybe it's really us who have the separation anxiety, but that's beside the point) and the dog-friendly patio is great for all of us! The servers are always great at bringing out water for the dog also. 

The \"rocky start\" I am referring to is the first time when my friend and I came here, our waiter forgot about us for a while. He had brought us water and then nothing for about 20 minutes. My friend and I were just hanging out and catching up, so it wasn't a huge deal, and when I finally walked over to him and asked for him to come help us, he was very apologetic and actually voluntarily brought his manager out because of the mistake. This really spoke well of the place to me because I could tell that they actually cared about their customer's experience and were willing to remedy the situation. 

Their beer selection is also on point, and I really appreciate their creativity to make beers like the Strawberry Milkshake, along with some classic IPAs and others. Their flights are a good deal and a good way to try a few of their brews before selecting your favorite. 

The food is also very tasty - definitely not just standard pub or brewery fare, they actually have great salads and sandwiches (I really enjoyed the Club with some tots). 

I'm glad this is the closest brewery to where I live and will continue to come back here (especially for UofA games)."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience! Tried to get them to call me a cab the other day, forgot my phone at my office. Wanted the cab  ride back to my office (Friday) to retrieve my phone. I typically use Uber...but no phone ! First young girl (young, skinny, brownish hair) said she would call the cab, 30 minuets later, no cab. The next young man I flagged down said there was a cab on the way ... then he made his way to the freezer and made a call? I know Phoenix is hot, but really? Hmm guess the first bar tender forgot to make the call??? I had the luck to literally have an off shift Uber/Lyft driver sit next to me... he took me to my office (no he didn't drink!). The beer is really good, the atmosphere is nice, but the service needs some schooling."}
{"text":"I was taken by surprise by how great the food was here, and no, it's not just the beer talking!

Truff Diver - mushrooms, arugula, cracked egg, truffle oil - I'm such a sucker for truffle oil and this was perfect on this pizza. 

Fire burger - pepper jack cheese, roasted jalapeño, red onion, hot aioli. Really enjoyed this burger. Cooked medium as requested and served as ordered and full of flavor!

Hatch chili beer - spicy yet refreshing beer. I'm a sucker for spicy beers too, and this one was done really well! 

With food names like \"truff diver\" and \"still jalapeño biznaz,\" I loved their creativity and cleverness. It seldom that I've seen breweries actually combine great beers with satisfying food. I usually just get one or the other but McFate pulls it off wonderfully. There's plenty of space for big groups like ours and our waiter, Garrett, handled our orders like a boss even when splitting checks at the end. I'm recommending this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"First time here last night, food was great, came out fast too. Margarita was also delicious and strong but not strong tasting which always means it's a great drink. Best part was Breanna our server, she rocked it! She was friendly, outgoing and really on it, I'm requesting her next time for sure! This is probably my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and never been impressed from the start. My own fault for returning to this place. The last time was this last Sunday. I ate the Sow Sweet pizza and got food poisoning. Not sure if it was from the apples or cheese but I do know I got it here. I don't wish that on anyone is was awful. The beer list is mediocre at best and the bartenders are complete assholes. Especially the guido with earrings who thinks he's too cool for school. Fill up the glasses and stop flirting with the female bartenders. Avoid this place unless you like terrible service."}
{"text":"Always good. Had a bit of everything. They have fresh ingredients and make an effort to be original even on the classics."}
{"text":"I have been at least four times already and the food has been consistent - it has been great!  Love the hot pretzels with the cheese sauce and spicy mustard.  A nice atmosphere to sit outside and enjoy a beer or wine.  It is even pet friendly. A needed addition to the neighborhood and I will be returning and introducing this new place to my friends."}
{"text":"Good food. Cool atmosphere. Fast service. Friendly staff. No complaints at all. Well maybe the entrance. I walked into the clothing store next door first"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch with coworkers. We were there about 1pm and there was no wait and the service was quick. We sat on the patio and our server was attentive. We easily were able to order beers and food with plenty of time to eat and chat before we had to go back to the office. We ordered some appetizers and a ribeye sandwich. Our food was consistently good across the board and the beer selection is pretty big. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is a little stuffy. Beer and food prices ok. The wait staff and bartenders very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch for the first time. The restaurant is a bit noisy, hard to carry on a conversation. Servers very friendly, and attentive. Food arrived to soon, following salad but was delicious nothing to complain about. Be specific on when you want your food, and I know they will accommodate. Price is good"}
{"text":"There was 5 of us for happy hour a few weeks ago. We got there at 4:30 and were seated on the patio next to the fire pit/place. There was only 3 of us for a bit and service was great! We ordered a few beers and an appetizer to share and the food was also good. We noticed a pretty large party arriving and our poor server looked like he had the entire patio and this large party (20 people). I had to leave in about 20 minutes so I asked the server for my tab. About 5 minutes later I decided to grab another beer and my revised tab. I received my beer but no tab. 20 minutes later I flagged down the other server and asked for my tab and gave her my credit card. She brought it back to me and charged the entire bill on my card. I flagged our server down and said I just wanted my tab for my two drinks and he then said, \"well you should have said that then\" and walked off. I stood there in shock as I did say that the first and second time. Even my girlfriends said I said it (I was questioning if I didn't make myself clear) but his response threw me for a loop. I won't hold it against him as I know he was overwhelmed a bit by the large party as his service for us diminished quite a bit after they arrived. I will try this place again as I would like to try other food."}
{"text":"Great service at the bar.  We sat ourselves, were immediately given menus and water and some time to make our selections.  Ordered a flight so that we could try everything.  The single hop sour (Mosaic) was my favorite!Wasn't here for food personally, but the other patrons getting food sure had some good looking and good smelling bites."}
{"text":"checked this place out for the first time tonight and boy did I leave feeling very satisfied! Sat inside, amongst a tall booth table which was very pleasant. Tried the Fate-ality IPA which was very smooth and tasty, and the pountine which was a life-changer. It was great to meet Steve and some of the crew, this place is great and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They recently tapped a new summer beer. I'm not usually a big fan of fruit flavored beer but this is my new summer favorite! The strawberry milkshake beer. It's slightly sweet but you actually taste the light flavor of strawberry! Cold and refreshing, it's easy to put 2 of these down quickly on a hot day. I don't know how well you could manage more because you can get sweetness overload...like if you have too many ciders in one sitting. But then just switch it up with my other fav, the spicy Hatch chili Gatos. This light beer is infused with the famous Hatch chili. it's not a hot beer but after taking a sip, you feel a very slight heat at the back of your throat. It's an interesting flavor combo that works out great!
Mcfate has updated some menu items with the addition of a delicious side of Mexican street corn, the spicy, tangy Southwest salad, and a surprisingly delicious starter option of ceviche. Also a couple new pizza items that we were too full to try this visit but we always come back."}
{"text":"Jessie was our server for the evening. He provided excellent service along with answering all of our questions about the beer. Jessie also checked on us to make sure our order was to our satisfaction. We will definitely be back!!! Thanks Jessie for the awesome service"}
{"text":"A great assortment of beers, tasty burgers, hot pretzels, innovative pizzas, and plenty of sandwiches & pup food options. What's not to like! Plus, it's right across the street from our office in SkySong, so a great place to stop at when I am out in AZ on a business trip. Plenty roomy in the inside as well as outside patio, and the open design is quite eye catching. I've already stopped in a few times on recent trips out to the AZ office, and will make sure to do so each and every visit!"}
{"text":"Went to Fate Brewing Company with two of my friends and couldn't have been more disappointed!! The building is brand new and aesthetically pleasing BUT looks can be deceiving. I enjoyed the atmosphere and that is about it. The bartender \"that served us\" wasn't helpful nor friendly and was also pushy and fairly unpleasant. We all tried the Easy A, the Double Oatmeal IPA, and the Standard Pale Ale all of which were absolutely terrible. None of the beers had any depth, body, or flavor. They all tasted and smelled like Pee. I will not be going back and I would recommend that nobody waste their time or palate."}
{"text":"This is our favorite brewery in the city. They do a great job of brewing several different styles of beer. Food is quite tasty as well. We visit quite often."}
{"text":"Until last night I had never eaten here, and I'm so glad I finally tried it! The food was so delicious, and the beer was really good as always :) I tried the Pueblo Vienna Lager, and it was great. If you like Mexican beers, you'll like this! 

For food I split the nachos with chicken (it's definitely worth it to add the chicken, they give you a lot and it's delicious!) and the Grilled Cheese Please with tater tots with my boyfriend. The grilled cheese tasted like the good kind you make at home, and the tater tots were amazing! I can't wait to come back in the fall when it's cool enough to sit on the patio, it's super nice and there are a ton of places to sit out there!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant brewery 
for the first time tonight with my wife. We split the McFate burger and a dozen Asian wings and a couple beers. The best thing we ate was the side of coleslaw that came with the skinny wings and the brown buffet beer. The burger was beyond ordinary. The Meat patty tasted like it was from Costco and I'd rather have a Wendy's burger.  We also received our entrée exactly 2 minutes after we received the Asian \"skinny\" wings."}
{"text":"I can't believe I like so many of their beers, that's just rare for me to find in one brewery.  Particularly their green chile beer, I'm not usually a fan of food flavored beers but hot damn, that caught me by surprise.  The bartenders are so attentive and confident, it a pleasure sitting at the bar.  All around a great place to go for local beer."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week and service is always good. This latest visit was especially great. Jesse is a great bartender and did a wonderful job with engagement. He talked us through the latest selection of beer and provided tastings for everything that piqued our interest. It just reinforced why this is my favorite neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"Where do you start?

From the food, to the beers, to the architecture of the building, Mr. McFate has really killed it.

To start, Fate-ality is quite the IPA that he has going. I had my fair share of them and a Pale as well to accompany it. The smoothness of these ales have really spoiled me and makes it difficult for me to want one anywhere else! If you're a hop-head, you need to test these out!

I tried the pizza with the grapes on it and it's just delightful. On top of the greatness of all the OG pizzas, they throw this bad boy in the mix! I got to taste the jalapeño burger and the tots as well and I'm so excited to text out what else is coming out of the kitchen. Tasty!

As for the building and the brew house, I'm so pumped for Fate. The building is huge to incorporate a lot more people, a huge brew house, and even a barrel-aging room. Everything is modern but still gives you that bar-next-door feel which is a hard task to accomplish.

You'll catch me and all of my friends at Fate South and I promise it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Everything is super delicious here. The spinach and artichoke dip is the best I've had. Their burgers are delicious too. They're open really late. Came here an hour before they closed on a Monday after my ASU commencement. Glad we stopped in and the service was great. My family and I came back later that week because we were so pleased. I'm not much of a beer drinker but they had a great selection."}
{"text":"In town for a wedding, and I was looking for a late-night bite to eat. They had a nice beer selection with lots of good craft beers. I wanted to try a lot of different things on the menu including sandwiches and pizza, but I went with a chicken farm salad because I wanted something cold to cool off from the heat. It was just okay. The salad seemed somewhat one-note like it needed something to brighten it up like crunchy nuts or seeds. I ordered a side of \"sweet fries\" (sweet potato), and those were very good, so I was happy. Somewhat noisy but that's expected to a bar-like atmosphere at a late evening time."}
{"text":"(Lyrics George Michael - Faith)

Oh but I need some Yelping from that brewery
Time to pick my appetite off the floor
Oh and when that beer comes down 
Without frothy foam

Well it takes a strong brew baby
and I'm ordering your nachos
But I'm showing you the door

Cause I gotta have McFate
I gotta have McFate
Cause I gotta have McFate, McFate
Cause I gotta have McFate, McFate, McFate


Mc-Yeah!  This place is close enough where I can bike myself to which is always a plus in my books.  The place itself provides a open atmosphere and has somewhat of a under-construction look.

My buds and I sat at the high top tables and order their craft brews.  I ordered the Nelson Pale Ale; I'm not much of a beer drinker these days nor can I say I'm an expert when it comes to hops and sorts.  Needless to say, I love a beer where I can actually taste the difference between each other!  

We started with appetizers and our server was quite helpful in making a decision.  I wasn't too hungry, but my buddy was so we ordered the Hummus & Harissa Plate and the Nachos.  The hummus was a house made garlic hummus and came with veggies and pita bread.  I thought this start was a delight and you can definitely taste the garlic!  Our nachos was huge and came with homemade chili, jalapenos, cilantro, sour cream and guacamole.  I regret not adding chicken to it; but overall and solid and probably one of my favorite nacho appetizer I've had in a long time.  Matter of fact I would say this is top 3 for sure!  We ended the night with dessert skipping entree since after the super awesome nacho we had nothing left!  We order the chocolate mousse with Oreo and whipped cream.  Again, what a pop to the senses!  Both smooth and creamy with a crunchy texture.  It was definitely appealing to the eye but also our appetite!

In the end McFate is definitely a must return for this Yelper, but also a great recommendation for beers, drinks, and great atmosphere! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Okay place for happy hour.Patio is acceptable.Prices are high.I expected more,sits in a weird area with no surrounding bars,certainly not OLD TOWN.Parking can be a problem.It is fairly new.I went in with high expectations but came away feeling it was just another brew pub."}
{"text":"Awesome selection! This was our first stop on our own brew tour! Jessie gave us great selections for our next stops! super friendly and knowledgeable  staff! Definitely will return on our next trip!"}
{"text":"I was just in town for work doing some recruiting at ASU. Stopped in for some drinks a dinner, just wanted to find a cool place I could watch a baseball game that had a good atmosphere... Let me tell you this place did not disappoint! Sat at the bar and was immediately given a glass of water and drink menus. Bartenders knew their stuff and made a great old fashioned! Food was solid and for the ambiance very fairly priced!"}
{"text":"Beer is ok. The staff sitting at the bar needs to realize that the customers should be sitting at the bar and not the employees. I get that the girl sitting next to me just got off work. But she was very rude in the way the asked me to move over. Get a table!"}
{"text":"This place has been open for a few months now and seems to be doing really well.  They just won an award for the best beer bar in Arizona.

Fate always has an extensive list of their own beers on tap along with a few guest handles.  I really like their Fate-ality and Double Oatmeal IPAs.

The food is just OK and my favorites are the chicken wings and the beer battered chicken appetizers.

They have a nice front patio and large indoor/outdoor bar with plenty of TVs.

Service has always been great at the bar especially from Eddie and Sean."}
{"text":"Love that this fabulous place is so close to me. Great beers - love the Fateful IPA. Best pizzas!  I usually go for the Hot Sausage, but love every single one of them. And you have no reason to check them out on a Monday, when pizzas are half price all day. Salads are awesome too - fresh and delicious. Really enjoy sitting outside and the ability to bring my dogs too. Oh, and surprised that the Bloody Mary was so awesome too."}
{"text":"I am updating my review to reflect the improvement in service. 

I walked up and naturally went to the wrong side of the building trying to enter it (Why I turn into Kelly Bundy at Breweries, I will never know...), then a young lady ran out and guided me in. I sat at the bar and munched of a delicious pepperoni pizza and bantered with the bartender. 

I noticed the original staff that was rude was no longer there- Good move McFate!

As I mentioned in the previous comment, the place is nice, the food was delicious, and now the staff is on point!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and quick but I was underwhelmed by the food. I ordered the Reuben Sandwich with an accompaniment of a Mango Slaw. The sandwich itself was okay but the dressing that came with it was pure vinegar, disguised as Thousand Island. I ordered a grilled chicken breast for my daughter but she took one bite and refused the rest. I thought she was just being picky so I tested it, and it just tasted like charcoal with little chicken flavor. I'm sorry but this was a less than average meal. I don't eat out often, but this was the closest to my mechanic within walking distance. But to be fair, the waiter and all of the staff were kind and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! For starters the staff is super friendly! Just like all the other breweries they have a great selection of beer. But what separates them from the pack is their bar food. The chicken and French Fries are not packaged chicken. Fresh chicken hand battered. Hot and delicious. It's making me hungry just writing about their stuff. Time to go back and enjoy again!"}
{"text":"Best bar nachos ever!! So yummy. Have come here numerous times and it's always been great! Fast service and lovely patio atmosphere."}
{"text":"This would have been 5 stars but there were some service issues that were lacking.  It seemed like whoever was supposed to be our waitress ended up being too busy so it was quite awhile before somebody got over to us and then took awhile to get our drinks. 
My major complaint though was that we ordered appetizers, kids meals and an adult meal.  They brought out one kids meal right away. But then the rest of us sat there waiting, he was done eating by the time the rest of the food came. Then they brought our appetizers and all of our food all at once so we couldn't really enjoy the appetizers before the food got cold.  When people order appetizers those should be brought out, then the food started, not everything served at the same time and 15 minutes after one random kids meal was served. 
We also ordered a 32oz growler and were brought a 64 oz instead. 
That said, the food and beer were all really good, no complaints there. We might eat here again but make sure to order our appetizers first, then our food."}
{"text":"Cute new place to hang out and grab a beer, or enjoy a great well put together menu. The outside seating area is amazing when the weather is nice, and the whole inside opens up to create a really nice open feel. 
The menu was very straight forward...apps, salads, pizzas, sandwiches and burgers. 
We ordered the fish sandwich and the California club. The California club was amazing! It was huge, and had a nice amount of fresh grilled chicken. The fish sandwich wasn't bad, but it was a little dry--I loved the sides, but i would order something else next time. 
Seemed like they don't have a full bar, and i didn't see their wine list this visit, so I'm not sure it exists. I'd definitely try this place again, especially when looking for a place to enjoy a gorgeous day out."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about my favorite brewery. Mcfates is like if four peaks and OHSO had a baby. I've tried a lot of their menu and my favorite dinner is the farm salad with salmon added. the BBC is a great way to start your meal. Get mild sauce and ranch on the side! The beer really is what makes Mcfates the best. My current favorite is the half way to heffen- it comes in a huge mug. You're welcome."}
{"text":"There was definitely a buzz in here tonight!  It was great to be able to experience the new Fate South with my family.   

I'm not one for long reviews, so here are a few highlights:

1) Amazing beer (yes, their beer up North has always been great). (I had Fate*Ality IPA and an Export Stout and my wife had the Oh My Gatos! Golden Ale).
2) Expanded appetizer menu: We started with pretzels - they always go over well with my family.  Now they have fries and tots - both were hot and tasty. The folks at the next table had sweet potato fries that they said were \"top notch.\"
3) Expanded dinner menu:  I stuck with my favorite pizza in town and had a \"Jess.\"  My nieces ate a pepperoni (they are picky...all gone).  The addition is sandwiches and burgers.  My daughter ate a Fate Burger and loved it.  Next time I visit I'm going to give the veggie burger a try. I also saw some salmon go by on a salad that looked good.

So...if you're looking for some place new with great food and beer...I'd give the new Fate a visit. The staff is friendly, the beer is yummy, and the food is tasty.

P.s. I can't wait for cooler nights on the patio!"}
{"text":"Soooo... I came in for dinner and the wait was 45 mins.. No problem I really wanted to come here and try the food... The food was good but the service was horrible!!! 

I ordered a \"grape of thrones\" as soon as we were seated and it never came ( I reminded her after we ate to make sure not to bring it) she apologized... We did not get our cutlery/napkins until after we were done with our food (had a burger and a pizza)... We literally had to ask someone else to close out... 

Again, I understand it was busy and was willing to wait but DO NOT seat me if you are not ready! Our waitress (who I do not want to name) was clueless! 

Maybe if I had a different server my experience would have been better."}
{"text":"GREAT atmosphere, large place, happening, good drinks, delicious food, excellent service, patio sitting, big TVs for sports, heaters, sufficient parking. Well done!!"}
{"text":"Gone on enough mondays (1/2 off all day) to try every pizza on their menu. Total outcome...nothing really special. They have a strawberry milkshake beer that is pretty tasty! 

Service is only ok, people just don't seem to like working there."}
{"text":"I've been to Mcfate a couple times and have had great experiences both times. They typically have a couple nitro beers on tap, while providing options of ales, ipa, lagers, porters and stouts, and a sour. They always have a wide variety no matter what type of beer you're into. 

The staff has treated me well and the service has been prompt."}
{"text":"Went to Mcfate twice while visiting Scottsdale for spring training.  We would have gone every day of our vacation had we discovered this place sooner.  Tried several of the beers, and all were top notch; very unique as well.  The food is also great, and reasonably priced.  I tried the bbc and the chicken club.  Both were great.  We'll certainly go back when we're in town next year"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food was great along with the beer and service. The band playing today was good also (The Conversates?) Def will come back. 2nd time and just as great as the first!! If you want some good beer and food. Come on out."}
{"text":"This place is so legit, the food is fantastic and their in house brewed beers are some of the best in house beers I've ever had, I love hoppy brews and the fatality ranks up there in my top ten IPA"}
{"text":"Great snack food, atmosphere & beer! Went on a weekday during the end of spring training. The patio is where it's at- large bar, tables, awnings & umbrellas and cornhole. They had several beers on tap- 12-18 beers with lots of a flavors for everyone. We enjoyed happy hour with $2 off on snacks and $1 off on drinks. Shared the hummus, nachos & hot sausages pizza between 4 adults, it was plenty of food. Make the short drive from Old Town Scottsdale, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place has the best customer service.   All of the servers are meticulous. They remembered all of our drinks, even when. We didn't. They are all so personable and fun.  Thank you for being awesome!"}
{"text":"The beer was fresh, had excellent flavor, body, and the food was on-point. All in all, an excellent place to grab some local brews and great food."}
{"text":"I'm personally a fan on Fate brewing. Not only do they have some great brews but the atmosphere is pleasant, lighting is great, and the food is pretty great also. Had the grape pizza on our visit and it was one of the most delicious pizzas I've ever enjoyed! Who woulda thought grapes on your pizza? But they do it - and the folks love it (myself included). 

Outside patio is great and the lighting out there is great too. I enjoy their mini goblets for flights and always try to enjoy their new ones every so often that they change them around."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week, you can get a quick bite sitting up at the bar. Buffalo Chicken Wrap and the Street Tacos are my favorites!"}
{"text":"I really love this place! Awesome food and fun atmosphere. We have tried the pretzels & cheese, hummus appetizer, guacamole appetizer, and a few pizzas. All the pizzas tasty. My favorite was the bacon, spinach, & ricotta pizza. 

They always have an awesome selection of local & Fate beer which fun to try. My only suggestion is that they need to get more than one set of bean bags for corn hole. There was a wait because they only had one set on hand."}
{"text":"The exterior of the building is very eye catching.  The interior doesn't disappoint either with it's tall ceilings and industrial look.  The bar is a huge cement square and there is plenty of seating.  We were there on Thursday night the week it opened, and there were very few tables open and only two bar stools open.  Our bartender, Cheryl, was very nice and introduced herself and asked our names.  She was quick to take our drink and food orders and was very friendly.  We ordered a pizza and the fish sandwich to share.  The fish sandwich was a little bland.  I think the fish needed more seasoning or maybe they could beer batter it for more flavor.  Hubby and I both enjoyed the tarter sauce that came with it.  The pizza was good, but pretty greasy.  The beer was fantastic and I can't wait until all those taps are full with more selections!"}
{"text":"Good food, good beer...terribly uncomfortable high-top bar chairs. I wanted to stay and relax and drink more, but the chairs were killing me. They look great but, awful to sit in for more than 30 minutes."}
{"text":"The wife and I decided to come to McFate for lunch today mostly to try the Oatchata milk beer I saw on their Facebook page. We only had a small one of those via a flight, it was great just wasn't really going to go with what we planned to eat. I had the fire burger and my wife had the ahi Asia salad. I loved my burger, it wasn't like a big beef patty I could make rare but it still tasted good and I loved the sauce. My wife said she loved her salad, it wasn't drenched in sauce and didn't feel heavy. For pints I had the false promises IPA which I enjoyed strong but light going down and my wife had the fruity mcpunch which was pretty darn good. Nailed the taste they were going for. Also we loved how they were playing reggae while we enjoyed lunch."}
{"text":"Cool name, but everything else is cookie-cutter.  Nothing different than any other attempting-to-seem-trendy-and-unique joint in town.

Nothing special on food menu, beer menu, or atmosphere. World of Beers is a better value, for example for selection, or Thirsty Lion as an example of unique atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing! Excellent beer selection with options to try other brewery gems as well. I would have to recommend ordering the Fate beers, but how cool to see that the beer world is supportive of each other. 
The design is really neat, we can't wait for the cooler months so we can see the garage doors go up and remember why we don't move out of the desert! 
We had lunch today and although the place was packed, the service was spot on. We had a strawberry blonde waitress and one with purple streaks serving our table. The food was excellent, the Peggy Rita pizza and the Fate burger were the favorites. 
Support this awesome, locally owned  treasure! Can't wait to come back and try some more Fate beer!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the food has been eh. Today I got the chicken club. The bread was not toasted and saturated in the grease from the chicken.  My friend described the pizza as a Totinos and my other friend said the tacos had a good sauce but the seasoning was just off, salt was needed. The beer is good of course, so come here for the beer, but eat before you come. The manager was nice, he said he would exchange the food, but I was already turned off."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of McFate! Their south Scottsdale location is much bigger and has an awesome patio. I went to their yoga class on Sunday (for $10 you get a great yoga class and a pint), and stayed for lunch after.  I had the crispy chicken sandwich on a friend's recommendation, and it was great! I got the No Nelson, which has always been one of my favorites. In the past, they have been quick to run of beer, but with their expansion, they seem to have everything on tap lately!"}
{"text":"really good beer! usually most breweries I try there's only very few I like but we tried 3 different flights and I liked most of them surprisingly. I did have my favorites like the oatchata milk shake and the export stout was amazing! will definitely be coming here again... and again! our bartender Jesse that day was awesome he's really nice and gave us a free taster! thanks Jesse."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breweries in the valley. Indoor/outdoor seating where you can enjoy the weather. Food and beer are mostly all good to try and it's also a great place to catch a game. Knocked them a star because the wings here are bad...really bad. Other than that I've had good food and beer every time I've been here."}
{"text":"This place appeals to the caucasian hipster crowd.  They made up all of the patrons until we came in.  Nothing wrong with that- it's just an FYI.  The majority of the tables seat four and are as high as the bar with heavy barstool-height seats that are hard to scoot in.

The place is brightly lit.  The beer is average.  The food is resaonably priced based on our one and only visit.  We got adequate but not good service.  Our waiter was all over the place and kept forgetting to bring things (like tableware, then napkins).  But that was just one visit.  It was crowded, but there was no wait.  I am sure most customers have had a better experience at Fate.

My sandwich was very good.  I ordered a Reuben.  It had just enough meat to be passable, and about three times the thickness of sauerkraut (usually it's about half and half).  But it tasted good and I'd get it again.  The beer was nothing special.  I wouldn't go there expecting a special brew.

My wife ordered a hot sausage pizza.  It was completely limp.  They say you can special order a thin crust pizza, which we didn't do.  But this thing was as limp as fully cooked pasta.  It tasted fine, but I didn't see much meat on it.  Frankly (and I don't mean to be gross), the meat looked like drippings of dark diarrhea, and there was hardly any on it.

I just don't think it's a good value when there are so many other brew places with great beer and food nearby.   Unless we get a great coupon, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Had dinner at McFate's yesterday evening.   All  was good...both my wife and I enjoyed our entrees which were plentiful.
I started with one of their IPA's which was good but not terrific.  Then our waitress brought me a few samples of their other offerings and I struck paydirt with the Triple Double...a DIPA with oatmeal adjunct.    It was exceptional...rich, flavorful, and smooth.   A world class beer!
I'd return (though we were from out of town) to enjoy this brewpub again."}
{"text":"Loved this spot. Sat outside with the kiddos. Food was great and the beer was even better!"}
{"text":"How about Vivian and Howie! Those two behind the bar are the true dynamic duo. She was quick with help and ideas and he was absolutely abundant with knowledge. My wife and I were constantly surprised with new tastes from both. A great restaurant, a great atmosphere, and a great staff. Will return!"}
{"text":"I'm moving them from 4 stars (because of a bad experience with service in the beginning) to 5 which is much more accurate for this amazing place. 

I absolutely love the beer, food and most of all the service. One of my favorite breweries to frequent."}
{"text":"Was there yesterday for lunch and the food and brews were great. Found it here on Yelp which did not let us down.  The service was great and the people were really friendly. Try the chocolate stout."}
{"text":"My husband and I live about 2 minutes away and we frequent this place pretty often. Anyway I have a favorite kind of \"special\" order that I always get. I had had a rough day at work and my husband got us takeout and he ordered my favorite sandwich. When I got home and was so excited to eat it, it turned out it was the wrong sandwich. When I called to let them know, the manager, Hugo, offered to remake it and refund us for it. Not to mention it was late and I'm sure their kitchen was closing. They were great. I know I can be a crab after a long and stressful day at work and sometimes all you need is your favorite sandwich so this meant everything to me--lol. We love this place and we appreciate the great customer service too. Thanks Hugo!! Btw if you must know...my favorite sandwich is the fire burger but instead of a burger I sub the patty for a crispy chicken patty. It's amazing! Cheers!"}
{"text":"The building is awesome and caught my eye on my regular commute. A big fan of breweries in general, I was excited to try fate out. 

The interior is beautiful and the menu is interesting. The poutine was pretty good, even though they were pretty sparing with the toppings.

The food, however, was very, very mediocre. Bland and a little dry. They burnt my date's pizza a little bit as well, and it too was fairly bland and unsavory. They took a long time to get me the beer I ordered, and I could tell it had been sitting on the bar waiting for some time, so it wasn't really that cold. 

We did wait a little while for service, though nothing out of the ordinary for a place this busy. 

Mostly the food is just forgettable and disappointing."}
{"text":"Went to McFate for a bachelorette party and had a good time with great company. Our waiter was THE BEST. He was definitely FIVE STAR status, I wish I was better with names because he deserves a shout out. 
We all ordered beer. I tried the beer with hatch chilies and I also had the cream ale. I enjoyed the chili flavor, hit right at the end. I spent a semester in new Mexico during undergrad and it was green chilies on everything there, this beer brought back fond memories of that time. I typically love cream ale but I felt like their cream ale was watery and leaning towards an IPA.
I ordered the nachos as an entree and that was my biggest downfall. They were heaping and loaded, which was awesome. Our waiter recommended I get the chili in the side-glad he did! He said it was very heavy, which was true, but I also disliked the flavor. It was very sweet and pasty. ( I get that chili is one of those things that changes depending on where you're from and how they make it there. I grew up eating east coast chili and usually am pretty picky.) 
The biggest strug with the nachos was not the chili though, it was the cheese. It was pretty much straight velveeta which was okay-till it all began to solidify in about 10 minutes :/
The steak sandwich was a hit with some of the girls and a lot of people ordered burgers or Salmon. No one raving about their meal, but the ambiance was lovely and the service was great."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great pretzels. Great salads. Great beer. Quick service. No complaints :)"}
{"text":"Well this about the price of nachos and other items. The price and quality of beer is fine but $17 for chicken nachos that are under the \"Snacks\" area on the menu and not much of anything in them is just wrong! 
I don't mind paying hipster prices on pub food to go along with my hipster beer at my local hipster micro brew but come on....anyway the beer rocks but save your money and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"This happened over two years and I had a flashback when a buddy of mine recently asked if I wanted to go to McFate. My wife and I sat at the bar, ordered a salad and a burger. We ordered beers, which were not memorable, but the food was. After a minute of wife eating her salad, she noticed a dead fly in it. It was disgusting. We both have worked in the food industry and are understanding of shit happening. The more disgusting part was the way staff and management handled it. Bartender grabbed the salad once we told her. She said nothing to us about it. We didn't want another salad after the incident. The manager comes up after to us and says \"normally that doesn't happen\". That is all. Wtf. Doesn't comp anything. Pay full price for our items. Will never be going back there."}
{"text":"First time here, won't be the last! Menu is extensive and patio seating is amazing. They have corn-hole and are dog friendly. Misters on the outdoor bar, and huge inside seating area as well. Entrance is towards Scottsdale Rd- walk in front of Plato's Closet to get inside!"}
{"text":"I tend to come here too much, maybe.

Interesting beer list with some cool seasonal offerings throughout the year.

The dining room is big and open, but can be noisy at peak times. Pretty good food options, I've heard rave reviews about the pizza but haven't managed to give it a go just yet. I often order a burger or the chicken club, always with tater tots! Their tots are perfectly crisp and delicious.

Good place for a casual date or to meet a friend."}
{"text":"Pretty restaurant. Couldn't drink but had a solid fried chicken sandwich. Very nice outdoor patio for lunch. Most parties seemed happy."}
{"text":"Went last night for beers and snacks. We tried 4 different drafts, all were excellent. We had the hummus and harrissa plate and it was awesome!! We sat at the outside bar and had an excellent time. The bartenders were very friendly and checked on us often. The guy sitting next to me had the fish and chips and it looked great! Will try that next time. And there will be a next time!!"}
{"text":"Service at the bar was amazing. Bartender was attentive and helpful. The food wasn't too exciting...pizza, wings, burgers...pretty mediocre. Beer was good....except for the fact they were out of 6 of their guest beers (on a list of 8). Decent place."}
{"text":"The location was ideal for me since it was by my hotel. The decor and atmosphere was great for spring time. I wish I could say the same for our server. She didn't greet us, was rude, and I never saw her smile once. The other servers came over to talk with us and as we were leaving the rude server then wants to talk with us. I was thinking uhh no you had your chance. I most likely will be back but will not want that girl we had. She was just miserable!"}
{"text":"The setting inside was great.  It has a nice fancy outdoor section with a cool indoor bar area good for watching sports. The beer selection was plentiful and the food was tasty. Good variety."}
{"text":"LOVE! I've been meaning to go here since I drove by one time so finally my boyfriend & I rode our bikes here & it did not disappoint. The patio was super cute & there were a bunch of people on it (I saw some corn hole too). We sat inside which wasn't as crowded (it was a really nice day out). We got a flight of 6 beers & then got one other - my rankings from favorite to least favorite:
1 ) American Pale Ale (I'm a pale ale girl!)
2) The Thames They Are A Changing 
3) S.P.A. 2.0 
4) Fate-Ality! IPA 
5) Red Hop 
6) Oh My Gatos! Golden Ale 
7) Hatch Chile Cream Ale (pretty good but couldn't drink a lot of it)
We also got the spinach dip -- SO good. Service was great. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"McFate is conveniently located across the street from my office, so I end up here often for lunch or happy hour with my co-workers. The food is good, and the beer is even better! The atmosphere is also great -- very open location with an awesome patio. A much-needed addition to this area and somewhere I'll continue to frequent regularly -- even though I really wish the name was still just Fate ;)"}
{"text":"My favorite things about McFate: dog friendly, short-ish wait times for a table during busy hours, their food. I've really enjoyed their menu - buffalo chicken wrap, poutine, pablo honey flatbread. 

Things that could use improvement: beer rotations (they seem to have most of the same beers every 2-4 weeks when we go), wait staff are hit or miss (sometimes they're great and other times we have been unimpressed)."}
{"text":"McFate had a great selection of brews for all beer lovers. The staff was most friendly and Anthony made sure my fiancé and I were taken care of. The service was fast and attentive and they had a great dessert selection. There is also seasonal selections and their beer was great. Would highly recommend for anyone interested in craft breweries!"}
{"text":"Great food, Reuben and wraps are great.  Pretzels are a great starter.  For beer wow.  Shot in the Arm, is like Black Tuesday.  Blonde Oatwine is special."}
{"text":"The beer was great and so were the pretzels and beer cheese... But we just couldn't get past the horrible waitress. Felt like she wanted to be anywhere but there and certainly did not want to be bothered by us. A shame. The place seemed pretty cool and food around us looked good. Lots of other great breweries around why settle for really bad service."}
{"text":"5 stars for the ambiance and decor. Friendly staff. The food not so many stars. Had the veggie burger. It looked and tasted like it came from the frozen section at Costco. Two small slices of avocado and one small tomato slice. Onions and lettuce were a good portion. No choice of bun. Just a bland white bread. The Coleslaw was tasteless. Ordered a glass of white wine and it was a very small pour. Very disappointed. My friend ordered the chicken salad and she said her salad was just okay."}
{"text":"In from Las Vegas picking up a new puppy. Stopped by with our son who lives here in Scottsdale and our other dog. He convinced us to try one of his favorite places, McFate, and I gave to say we loved it. The beer was good, could have been colder, and the food was just as good. Very quick service from the kitchen from time of order to service at table. But I have to say, the waitress made it the most enjoyable. Jessica made the night great. Nothing specific, just very attentive, enjoyable and personable. Thanks for the great evening. She seemed to actually want to make sure we enjoyed our evening. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We've been waiting for Fate to open as we work right across the street and have been excited to have something like this within walking distance. We came for lunch today, the day after their grand opening and had a great time. 

The building is super cool and really pretty and the space was very open. The were only moderately busy, it wasn't bad at all. I got the Oh My Gatos! Golden Ale which I really liked, and I ordered the Garlic Burger with fries. Our food came out in a decent amount of time and everything tasted great, the burger was juicy and cooked just right, fries were really good as well. 

I was close to giving 5 stars but there were just a few small things I would improve upon. I wasn't really sure which side was the main entrance, so we walked in through the doors in the back by the Plato's Closet side. It was a little confusing because that takes you kind of in the back. There is a sign pointing towards other doors to tell you where to go to get seated but when we walked through and were still a little unsure where to go. We wandered a little and finally found our way up to the hostess area. 

I would also maybe add a tad bit more variety to the menu. The main options are burgers, pizza, sandwiches and salads. I'd like to see maybe a good mac and cheese or pasta dish,or  some kind of chicken strips... something like that. Not that simplicity is a bad thing. I enjoyed our lunch and will definitely be back, looking forward to trying out some of the appetizers and happy hour specials! :)"}
{"text":"We usually sit at the bar top and come in as frequently as once a week. Any of the male bartenders are fine - some more friendly than others, but steer clear of the female bartenders. They're rude and pissy. Nearly 24 hours since our last visit and I'm still mad about how rude the woman working last night was. While an elderly, frequent patron was drunk and sleeping sitting up right across from us (he legit appears to be an alcoholic they continue to serve) this girl behind the bar - who was not helping us at all last night - came over to my wife and I - who were not remotely intoxicated- and said she has to take our drinks away in a minute because they've closed and it's the law. Perhaps someone could have called out last call? Or the bartender helping us could have asked to close our tab? Or maybe if she had just been pleasant instead of bitchy and confrontational... endless possibilities for handling that with better customer service, let alone human interaction. 
This place has pretty good food and we enjoy their personal beer selection but I can get that else where. Staff can make or break a location and I'm deeply disappointed in McFate's. We've taken lots of family and friends here, but I think our next get together will be at Goldwater or Scottsdale Beer Company instead."}
{"text":"Food awesome! 
Service great! 
Booze bomb!
but the best part is that it's walking distance to a strip club. 5 stars for that!"}
{"text":"I went in for the first time to watch a Cardinals game and it was a better experience than expected. There are a lot of micro breweries that are popping up all over the place and they don't know how to do it, Fate does! Our bartender Dave was not only very knowledgable with all the beers, he made sure we taken care of the long time we were there. Also, Steve, who I assume is the manager there made sure that we knew everything about the history of the company and gave us a tour. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 4:45 pm on Friday afternoon. We were looking forward to having a few beers and excited to check out a new place (for us). The parking lot looked busy but there were lots of open tables. We got a patio seat immediately-the hostess was very friendly-and that was our last positive interaction. We sat and watched while tables who were sat after us were waited on and served drinks. All the while we sat staring at the several servers who seemed to be working the section where we were sitting. After 15 minutes I walked up to the bar and asked if I could just order a couple drinks and mentioned we hadn't been waited on. Instead of just allowing me to order at the bar, the bartender said she would send someone right over. She seemed concerned and apologetic. Unfortunately, we still sat another 10 minutes while EVEN MORE tables who were sat after us got served. Finally, just got up and left.  I had really enjoyed the Fate brews I had tried at several beer festivals, but after this interaction, I have no desire to even try this place again."}
{"text":"Great food and drink. Our waiter Derek was great. Drove in from California.  Had the chicken wrap and Reuben, with great pretzels."}
{"text":"What a great Brewery, many choices in craft beers ( I prefer dark beers, and they had some great dark choices). Go hungry, the bar food is great. We were too full to have dinner after a couple of appetizers. The place is always hopping, be prepared to wait for a seat at the bar. Make a reservation for dinner when you arrive, then chill out at the bar."}
{"text":"Terrible food, terrible beer and terrible service.  I live a few blocks away and was so excited to have another brewery so close.  I unfortunately have been disappointed on all accounts the few times I have gone there.  All I can say is never again."}
{"text":"Dog friendly large patio. Grape pizza is excellent. Other food just at par. Decent beer selection on tap."}
{"text":"We love checking out new venues in south Scottsdale/north Tempe. Fate Brewing is s delight!  We've now eaten lunch, happy hour, and dinner there. Of course this weather is perfect for dining on the patio near the fire feature. I love the green area!  

Great selection of brews - the hatch chili beer is our favorite, but alas seasonal!  The appetizers are good - I'm addicted to Poutine!! I am a fan of their garlic burger and sweet potato fries. Their grilled cheese is nice, but missing some accent such as tomatoes or mild green chili. They have a private room in the back where we will be biking a dining club meeting. The staff is friendly and attentive. 

Definitely a new favorite!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, friendly staff. Beer is very solid and the guest taps cover any hole in their offerings. Pizza is 12\" kids pizza is about 10\" and half price. Service was a bit on the slow side for beer and pizza."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent, staff is friendly, and the beer is amazing  love the strawberry milkshake wheat ale, or the fatality IPA!"}
{"text":"So good we visited twice on our trip to Arizona!  Awesome food and the best selection of beer of the multiple breweries we visited.  Large indoor seating area, plus the oversize bar with open air seating that leads out to the patio.  The pretzel appetizer is to die for!"}
{"text":"It was decent food. They take some chances on the pizza. I like that they take chances on flavor pairings and create some really interesting flavor layers."}
{"text":"I would have given this more stars of our bartender {I nicknamed him Leif Erikson) remembered that he was there to fill glasses and not hangout with his friends at the bar. We just got poor service and had empties waiting way too long. Everyone esle (who did not have Leif) were having a good time drinking their filled glasses. Food came vis other servers and was very good.  We liked everything, See pics. Yummy food and if you get drunk enough, you can go blow your whole paycheck at Plato's closet!"}
{"text":"I don't believe these things scale so, should have known better. Friday evening, busy. This is one of those, hey,it must be me reviews because the place was packed. 
 
Menu tiny type, crap lighting, had to bring out the phone to read it. , Noise, excessive.  

string fries aren't a suitable base for poutine unless you wish to make the cheese curds appear large. It's a good sauce which I think was wasted on the base, Fair portion though missing curds/ If there's bacon in there it's really tiny. 
The wings, they come out with  1/2 drums / 1/2 wings on opposite sides of the plate, are small - medium. The sauce was pleasant enough but not befitting the habanero name.  

Not going to diss the beer this time,  really didn't like it and I should have gone with something I have more experience with.   All in all, blah


Their website is pitifully slow too:)"}
{"text":"Went to Fate for a late dinner tonight and was thoroughly impressed. Not only were the apps and pizza delicious (recommend the Peggy Rita pizza), but the staff was sooo nice to us and super attentive from start to finish. The beer was really good and the atmosphere was fun. We sat at the outside bar to enjoy the weather. Cheryl the bartender is hilarious. A manager, Dave, checked on us during our meal and I thought that was really nice. I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Good grief, needed to update my review.  We love thus place. Have only had one mediocre experience.  Sorry,  being sexist but the male bar staff are more attentive than the gals. Finally enjoying the patio. Great space."}
{"text":"Great vibe and pretty good service. Went with some friends for happy hour the first time and I got the spinach dip... I ended up eating it as a meal. Chips were perfectly crispy and sturdy spinach dip was amazingly creamy. I had been eyeing that blackened chicken club though so I decided I had to come back. 

I did make it back over a few weeks later for my chicken club and sadly was pretty disappointed. Bread with great but the chicken just tasted like burnt chicken, not like a true blackened (seasoned & charred) flavor. I was pretty disappointed in that but I'll still head back because the place seems great. 1 bad sandwich isn't going to hold me back. The pizza looks superb."}
{"text":"Overall, McFate is a great place. Their HH hours (11-6pm), beer prices and selection of beers are very competitive. Their Monday pizza specials are fantastic. And the service is really good, too."}
{"text":"Had lunch here while waiting for my car to get fixed at Lexus.  Awesome place,  great atmosphere,  good pizza and drinks.

Will be back to try at night."}
{"text":"Excellent food with great portion sizes.  Super friendly and helpful server.  The Irish Red was fantastic.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered the fish sandwich and farm salad. I'd get both again. They were delicious. Side of fries was huge. I was eyeing the pizza at other tables. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have so many great things to say about this place. First, the food is amazing. Try the pretzels and The Jess pizza. I am salivating just thinking about them. Fate has something for everyone on their menu if pretzels and pizza aren't your thing (ya weirdo). The atmosphere and decor is pretty modern and the outdoor seating is bomb. Bring your dog!! Lastly, their to-go is really fast and packed nicely. Sometimes I pick it up if I don't feel like getting dressed and I'm trying to binge on Netflix. It's a perfect date night too! Can't go wrong with the beer either! Okay, I'm done.

Ps. I promise I don't work for them... Haha"}
{"text":"Always a great outing when I go here! I have sampled all of the beers and seem to keep gravitating to the Fateful IPA and the Chocolate Stout. Since Im filling up on beer, I always go with a salad here. The Farm is my favorite, but if you want meat go with the Ahi or Maui. They have lunch specials, one of which is sometimes half price on pizzas. Great Patio. Great Service. Great design. A MUST stop!"}
{"text":"Love Fate's, yes I'll always call it that, beer and the folks who started it but it's hard to believe this is run by same person as the original north location as the service is always subpar. Takes too long to get service, many workers seem too occupied with each other or themselves to be attentive. Food is decent and beer always good."}
{"text":"A buddy and I were driving through Scottsdale after the usual Sunday morning hike and were originally planning on stopping at Papago but found we were an hour too early. We were driving down Scottsdale Rd and ran into Fate. They have an excellent assortment of house beers and guest beers from breweries ranging from California to Michigan. My personal favorite is their Fate-ality IPA, whose hoppy strength rivals that of the SD IPAs I've been accustomed to. Their pita & hummus dish is also a pretty good pairing with a beer flight. 

So aside from the beer, food and location, the reason for 5 stars? MUSIC CHOICE! They had reggae playing the entire time which is a rare experience at an AZ brewery! Had me feeling totally at home being from So Cal. I can't wait to return and try more of their beer in such a nice ambience!"}
{"text":"McFate has a wide variety of local beers that's always changing. Little bit of everything for everyone. 

The food is also really good, there's about 5-7 sandwiches, 5-7 pizza options and 5-7 options for pastas. Got the blackened chicken sandwich and added ranch it was delicious!

I'd recommend paying the extra $1 to upgrade your side to tots, who doesn't love tots!"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere! But to top the cake we went to lunch there and not only was the beer great, the food amazing, and service impeccable but after we left we forgot our Togo food. As we drove to the front to run back in and grab it, our server was waiting on the curb with our food in hand! Doesn't get better than that! As a business owner and in the beer community, I was thrilled and over the moon in regards to our service! Thanks McFate!"}
{"text":"I was between three and four stars and if the food would've been better, probably four stars. The food was pretty dull and my Ruben tasted basically like sauerkraut and corn beef on rye. No sauce or any other flavor to give it some extra life. Another time I went, I got a burger and I knew when they didn't ask me how well I wanted it done, it was probably going to be average. I would call it average. The fries were fantastic though!

The staff was also very average. I think a bunch of people new to the restaurant business work there. 

On the positive side, it is very bright and upbeat. However, they are going to want a lot more monitors on game days. There are quite a few around the bar but not near enough in the bigger area. They took up a huge wall with a beer menu."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great atmosphere really good food and even better beer. Try the hatch chili beer; light refreshing with a little kick to it. Do not leave without trying the key lime pie, this homemade delicacy will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Steve has done it again. The new Fate South is amazing. The beer was awesome as always. I enjoyed the hummus plate. Thank you for hosting us. Look forward to spending time there. I think it will really be awesome when it is nice weather and opened up."}
{"text":"Huge home run by Steve McFate and his amazing team of people. The location is perfect and the atmosphere cannot be compared. The new menu will make you fat and happy. The beer. Oh my God the beer! By far the very best you will find anywhere in Arizona. Go there. Be there. Fall in love with your Fate."}
{"text":"Huge parking lot, super cool design, the beer is brewed in house and doesn't leave the confines of it's womb until it is being poured in your glass, and the food is amazing. What more can you ask for?

Very cool place, thrilled to have somewhere NOT Mill Ave/Old Town with ample free parking and a cool new vibe to it. I'll be going there often!"}
{"text":"We were out doin some car shopping on a Friday night and decided to pop into this place.  It looked like a cool spot, with a wide open-aired environment.

The patio was definitely busy, as we entered.  So busy, it was a 20min wait to get a table for two.  So we opted for a high top inside.

As we sat, we couldn't help but admire the setup.  A very comfortable & clean bar area.  We ordered a glass of their double nut brown ale and a glass of Moscato.  Both arrived quick and tasty!

We ordered their grilled cheese + avocado and a side of sweet potatoes fries, as well as their spicy burger + a side of tots.

When the food arrived, we couldn't help but note, it was a HUGE pile of sweet potatoes fries.  They could be a meal by themselves.  The burger had a good spice to it, without being overbearing.

All the food coming out to other tables looked great too.  So next time we are in the area, we will definitely stop back in."}
{"text":"Beer is so good, food not so good, unfortunately. They don't even have decent nachos, how do you eff up nachos?"}
{"text":"This place is amazing 
 Had the steak sandwich and it was the best steak sandwich I have ever had .I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Lots of beer, good food and the patio is excellent.  Tap rotates quite a bit.  I like that they usually have a sour on tap as well. Give it a shot I think you will dig it."}
{"text":"Love it!!! Visiting my brother & he took us 2 this awesome place!!! Spitting a fight w/ my sister!!!"}
{"text":"The Grape Escape Pizza, an epicurean delight that McFate Brewing Company absolutely freakin' nailed.

The perfect combination of the sweetness of the grapes, and the  savory, creamy mozzarella and goat cheese with a healthy dose of rosemary and balsamic vinegar will make you NOT want to share it with your dining companion. 

Hey, thankfully the crust is light enough that you could easily put away 2-3 slices! 

Came here for the first Brews Cruise UYE of 2016, and what an excellent way to ring in the new year. Service was on-point and they took on our large-ish group without a problem. 

Of course, I'm usually the DD prevention service so I didn't get to drink beer, but thankfully was able to come back and enjoy a flight! 

My favorites: 

1) McFate Hatch Chile Gatos 

A refreshing Golden Ale with the flavor of #NewMexicoTrue Green Chile without the searing heat. 

2) McFate Fatality IPA

If you love IPAs, this one won't disappoint. Be warned, it is a hoppier IPA for the IPA noobs.  Billed as having an \"irresponsible\" amount of hops and clocking in at 7.8% ABV, you're guaranteed to have a good time and quickly. 

We have also tried their Poutine, which thankfully, McFate now makes a smaller portion - called the Poutiney - so I don't feel like an utter fatass ordering the full portion.

While McFate is sparing with the cheese curds and bacon and these fries are of the shoestring variety, the stout gravy is quite delicious. 

Sit on the patio when it's not HellHundred degrees outside. 

Great experience with yet another fantastic local brewery!"}
{"text":"Great selection of house made beers, great food and great, attentive service.  One of my favorite brewery/restaurants.  Don't forget to get a Hatch Chili Gatos beer!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff. Very good menu and delicious food. Ahi Tuna salad is superb. Did I mention the friendly staff?!"}
{"text":"The bonus about this brewery is that it has a spacious area for fur babies and the servers were perky and nice once you can flag them down.  The food, however, could use a lot of help from the culinary gods. The hostess should be fired. There's plenty of brewery's popping up and if I were to be greeted in that manner, I'll be happy to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love Fate beers and love the fact they were among the early boomers when it came to small local breweries I. The Phoenix area. I've been to the north Scottsdale location plenty of times and thus south Scottsdale location is just as good as the north, just much larger and with a great patio facing Scottsdale road. Came here for a drink on Saturday night and it was busy, but not over crowded. I love the Candy Bar Milk Stout we ordered that and the Fatalitality super hoppy IPA. Very good beer. I didn't Oder any food but on my next trip I will. I'll definitely be back to this location when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"Cool place! I went with a group & everyone seemed to enjoy the beer. The wait was a little long, but we were there on a Sat with a large table, so this wasn't an issue. The pizza was good, but I've basically never met a pizza I didn't like. Others in the group weren't blown away by the food, but didn't have serious complaints either. We went to the North Location & the patio isn't exactly what I'd call cozy with a lot of traffic noise - just not set away/doesn't have a barrier to the busy road right there. I'd like to try the South Location."}
{"text":"My niece had come across some good reviews for this place so we decided to stop by. We sat in the patio and our order was taken rather quickly. Although we didn't order any food, the food menu was light, not too busy, and seemed to offer a variety. I ordered the flight while my nephew and niece ordered the Nelson and the Coffee Stout. We were impressed--the flavors, nicely chilled, the aromatic from the beers head was enticing. Overall, it was exceptional with the customer service, drink and food menus. If I lived there, I would frequent this place. Thanks."}
{"text":"What a cool spot!  I can't believe what they have done with this location... formerly a \"Home Buffet\"... now a very groovy brewery restaurant.

We got drinks, a flight of beer and it was super.  Dog friendly patio.  The pretzel appetizers were delicious.  The dinner was super... I had a salad and our friends had yummy sandwiches.
The staff were all super and the owner even stopped by and visited.  

Awesome!"}
{"text":"A neighborhood staple. Can't say enough about McFate. Always have the best beer, amazing customer service, upbeat atmosphere, and some of the best food I've ever come across at a brewery. Try the Grape Escape pizza you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The beer, food and service were all 5 star. We sat at the bar and Howie was our primary bartender. Being new to the area he spent a little extra time with us recommending places for us to go and see. The burgers were great. I recommend the Garlic Burger. The atmosphere is what really buts this brewery above the rest. My husband enjoys craft beer better than I do, but after hearing so much about the Candy Bar Stout I went for it. It is a very smooth stout with an excellent taste. It is definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Great selection of brews and a variety of delicious food choices! The place is also really nice. The restaurant is a really open space that is completely open (weather permitted) on one end, transitioning into the patio. The patio is also really nice with it's variety of seating areas, from bar seating to booths and more picnic-like tables. The look of the place is also spot-on with heavy use of rustic elements such as wood, concrete and metal."}
{"text":"Came here a few days after they opened and really liked it! I was expecting it to be a lot more crowded than it was since their was a lot of hype around it, but it really wasn't all that bad. Granted it was about 4 o'clock on a weekday & it was getting ready to storm. I live close by and I've driven by since and it's looked packed.

Anyway, I tried both the Summer Session IPA & the Hefeweizen. I liked the IPA. Was tasty and not too hoppy. Our waiter recommended the Fate-Ality IPA (which is a lot more hoppy than the one I tried), but I figured I'd save that for the next time. The hef was good, but wasn't one of my favorites. Compared to other breweries that I've tried hef's from this one just didn't have quite as much of a distinct flavor to it.

I wasn't planning on trying any food, but my friend ordered a pizza (gluten free) & I tried a couple slices. It was really good! I can't remember exactly which one we had, but it a was a veggie one (since my friend is vegetarian). In fact, the menu looked really good, and there's a lot more food I'd eventually like to try.

I hope this place does well and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Derek was serving and he was the one of best server I've seen. Food was really good and he was checking us very often!!"}
{"text":"First time but certainly not the last!  Was immediately greeted by Jesse.  Very personable and obviously takes pride in his job. Took the time to professionally and personally guide us to the right beverage choices, including providing samples. Food and wait staff were good as well. The experience was more than worthy of more visits to come!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite to eat at, as well as a fantastic beer selection of their in house drafts. They have a really diverse menu; there will be something for everyone to enjoy. Food has always been excellent and the prices are more than fair. I really enjoy going here and will continue to spread the word!"}
{"text":"Can't really rate food or drinks. Was sitting at bar for about 5-10 minuets and no one even said hello. Yes they where busy but to bypass a customer for that long is unacceptable."}
{"text":"More attentive bartenders and better food would improve this place. Great layout and outside seating areas. We ate at the bar. I wanted to taste their Dragon IPA that they brag about but they were out of it. I had a burger and my GF had a salad that was screwed up 10 ways from sunday. Way to impress the ladies Fate!! Really, a salad? Had to send back for the goat cheese and all three cranberry's were accompanied by 2 nuts. Such a bargain at 10 bucks!

I would go back. I probably would have the pizza as we stay beside some folks having that and it looked great!"}
{"text":"Pretzels are great, beer is really great, burgers and pizzas are pretty great as well. Atmosphere is great, patio area was great, staff was, for lack of a better word, great. Overall, a really great place to unwind after a great day."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Scottsdale and find ourselves coming to McFate at least twice a week. The beer selection is always changing and the food is simple but awesome!

Patio is dog friendly and the space is really cool. Definitely worth stopping by if you're in the area. 

I will say my favorite brewery in town for amazing food and service is Helio Basin but McFate is a close second."}
{"text":"Great beer and good food. I enjoy coming here even though it used to be a Home Town Buffet"}
{"text":"Mcfate is amazing!!! Every single thing I have ever tried on the menu was phenomenal in my experience. The wait staff is attentive and kind and always has the best recommendations! Sean was the most extraordinary bartender and everything that he recommended to me was absolutely perfect for my mood and what I was feeling. I was left so impressed and happy!"}
{"text":"Very good place. Service was exceptional, ambiance & seating were great. It's a very open floorplan where the outside blends with the indoors, they had the heaters on subtly just enough to keep it comfortable. I had the Buffalo Chicken wrap with fries, the wrap was good & the fries were excellent. I also indulged with the desert , chocolate pudding with Oreo & whipped cream..... Delicious!
It's just a little more expensive, but that's South Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This location blows the first location away by far. The restaurant is open and spacious and has a great patio. Atmosphere is awesome here. Lots of options for food and beer is great!"}
{"text":"Started a bar and brewery hop here. It was beautiful out so we sat on the patio but could still see the tvs at the bar. We got menus and water and got a quick explanation of the happy hour deals and beer menu.

This place has 19 of their own beers! Yep, 19.  We decided on some flights and then chose a pint later. All the beers were pretty darn good. They also had a wide variety of styles and flavors.

My girlfriend and I needed something to snack on and decided on the pretzels n beer cheese. They came quick, were giant, and the cheese was delicious. Also came with some brown mustard that had some serious horseradish kick.

Overall this is a great place to have some quality craft beer n a snack. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Definitely recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"First time visit food was ok but the service was awful!!! Waited along time to get waited on. We had to ask several times to get our drinks refilled!! They also left the big garage door open and it was cold!!!"}
{"text":"It's a big place with a great feel to it. We chose to take a seat at the bar which runs both inside and outside. 

We ordered the pretzel and hummus as appetizers. Bavarian pretzel came out warm. Dough has a slight sweet flavor which paired well with the spicy mustard. The cheese sauce was bland, so it sat largely in its bowl.   

The hummus and Harissa came with pita and veggies. The hummus was good. We expected a kick from the harissa, but it too, lacked flavor. I added Tabasco sauce to spice it up a notch.

To round out our meal, we ordered the salad with grapes. We ordered with dressing on the side, but salads came out fully dressed. The salad was good; mixed greens, chopped nuts and grapes, but a little too soggy with the dressing.

The service also needs a pick me up. Maybe because we were above the average age (the places was mainly 20-mid 30s) we were largely ignored. When the server paid attention, he was nice, but getting his attention wasn't easy and the order not correct."}
{"text":"Fate Brewery was one of my MUST SEE breweries that I had to go to while in Scottsdale, and I was not disappointed!

First off get a tester, don't think you can finish all of the tastes?? Who cares it's 10$ do it! You have to try all of them even if you think you aren't going to like them, you won't find these sort of flavors anywhere else! 

Secondly, I may have just gotten a Cesar salad but omg it was so good. You can taste the freshness in their house Cesar, and even the freshness of the chicken I added to it. 

There was a long wait when I was here about 7pm on a Friday night, but there was plenty of room at the bar, plus it was a great place to make new friends since I am not from the area. Which is always a plus. 

So go here! Do it!"}
{"text":"When with friends to watch a game. This place keeps it simple. Clean, consistent-service, and food quality was great! The beer which is their bread and butter was top
Notch with excellent variety. The Pueblo Vienna lager was very smooth and really drinkable. The deserts were lack luster not much variety and creativity. But come on they're a brewery.
It's about the beer. Look forward to seeing This brand flourish"}
{"text":"As always mcfates gets 5 stars beth was awesome today thank you and hugo just love that guy him and his staff always take great care of us. Will continue to be my favorite place"}
{"text":"Went out on a date here. Tried the twist of fate pretzel and a pizza. We both had american pale ale's then moved on to sampling some of the other beers pointed out on the wall. The cartel coffee beer was amazing!! A must try... Cant wait to stop back in. 3rd day open on a Monday and it was bustlin!"}
{"text":"Pizza and wings were very good! Service was a bit slow but overall would highly recommend."}
{"text":"The hatch chili Gatos is a great beer. Tastes so much like green chile's it's ridiculous... just the smell inside of the brewery won me over. They brew everything in back and is a classic brewery that has food, amazing 'revolving' beers to the seasons and their food is much more unique than bar food. I would venture to say it's even gourmet."}
{"text":"I raved about Fate when they opened and had a great menu and vibe. Weeeell a bit has changed. For example, the vege burger had almost a full 1/2 avocado sliced and expertly arranged across the patty, now it's a scoop of poorly made, and tasting, guacamole.  Everything that we loved about the place has changed, including the service. BUMMER!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday with some girlfriends - I ordered he salmon pesto Benedict... it was decent until I cut into the second poached egg and it was hard boiled. One friend got the French toast which came out with just sliced bread drenched in syrup... that was it. Apparently they ran out of the powdered topping... she sent it back, got the regular eggs Benedict... weird, both her \"poached\" eggs were hard boiled. She sent That Back for another order and finally it was edible... I say forget the brunch idea and stick to brews and pizza."}
{"text":"We love being able to walk to such a great spot for delicious beers and food! We goat lease a few times a month. The pretzel appetizer is one of the best we've had! The patio is great year round (heaters/listers/shade) and is dog friendly. See you soon, McFate:)"}
{"text":"The beer selection is PHENOMENAL. \"Absolutely Gorgeous\" one might say. Don't even get me started on the buffalo chicken wrap. As a buffalo sauce connoisseur, I was pleasantly surprised when the savory spice hit the lips. The only feedback I have is the brick fencing that separates the street peasants from the wealthy and rich made me feel uneasy(it's very poor and financially unstable looking) 
It was either that or the girl crying over the microphone playing piano. All in all, I rate this joint 4 stars and may God have mercy on that poor piano players soul."}
{"text":"Fantastic location. Great selection of house and guest beers. Great food too!  

This place is new. While I have had terrific experiences my past 3 visits, they are still working out a couple minor tweaks."}
{"text":"This place just opened up about a month ago and is right across the street from my office which is like a saving grace. 

I was super bummed when our company moved from our office in Old Town to Skysong because there aren't a lot of good walking distance lunch options. But then Fate opened and it's definitely very much welcomed!

They hosted a happy hour for us last night and we were in the private back room which I didn't even know existed! Would be a cool spot for private parties for sure. 

I've also been there a few times for lunch and their food is great. I've tried a few of the pizzas and something else that I can't remember but I definitely haven't been disappointed. I heard their grilled cheese is bomb.com so that's next on the list. I have a feeling the patio will packed when it isn't a million degrees out. 

The location is slightly off the beaten path but it's worth it. I'm all about it."}
{"text":"Please try the pizza here, it is so delicious, my favorite is the Pablo Honey, love the Radiohead reference, but the pizza boasts this habanero honey that blew my mind. 

I tried the Oatmeal brew it was delicious, as was all the beers they offered."}
{"text":"Goo brewery. Nice array of beers, had the Blonde Ale and the Irish Red. The Blonde Ale was the better of the two, the Irish Ale seemed flat to me. The Ale had a good crisp taste. 

Ordered the buffalo chicken wrap which was excellent. Had them sub the cesar dressing for ranch and add pickles. I think it made a big difference. Mango slaw is good too, has a nice ginger zing to it."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer.  The bar is enjoyable as half of it kind of wraps outside with plenty of misters and a patio area.  The ceilings are high inside, not like drop ceilings. The food is good and not like dive bar quality food.  They put some love into their dishes.

I'd consider adding more TVs."}
{"text":"A really nice new building that is for sure.  What seems to be missing is the friendly atmosphere of the original location. This has more of a corporate BJ's type feel to it.  Also, while I'm sure they are using the same recipes the pizzas seemed a little bit off from the original location.  Will come back and give them another chance but overall not to impressed with Fate South.  We also wonder if they have some sex fetish as both locations are located next to adult stores."}
{"text":"We came here a couple weeks ago on Halloween night, which fell on a Saturday. We have been waiting for this place We had a group of 6 of us and they accomidated us with a nice area on the patio (which is very nice and relaxing.) The waiter we had was knowledgable about the beers they carried. Their milk stout, I believe it was, tasted just like a snikers! All night long he kept pushing for us to take Tequilla shots which became annoying, then he I guess left for the night and we had a knew server. The food was just alright."}
{"text":"I'm not someone who drinks beer so whenever I get invited to a brewery, I get a little nervous.  Before arriving here last night I had looked on their website. and didn't see any other drink options.  However the food menu looked good so I knew that I'd be in great hands!  Once I arrived to a packed, fun and busy environment, I was happy to see that they did indeed serve wine and cocktails!  

I came here last night with a large party of 40 and they had reserved a great section for our group.  We weren't squished, there was plenty of room and the service was fabulous!  Kendyl was our server and she did a great job, food and drinks were constantly flowing on to the tables.  She also kept a tab for each individual person/group, which I know is difficult to do.  It was very handy at the end though when we didn't have to split a bill between everyone and go through the details of who owed what, etc; especially since some left earlier and later than others.

The drink prices are great, well...I just moved here from CA so to get a cocktail for $8 on a Friday night, is a score of a deal.  I'm too new to the area to know if that's low/high or not.   Everyone's food looked great!  Some got appetizers, sandwiches, pizzas and others just shared a few small bites.  I wasn't starving and seeing that we were in a casual atmosphere with everyone standing and watching the game on the tv's, I wanted an appetizer vs a main meal.  I decided to go for the hummus, as well let's just say I'm addicted to hummus :).  The pita that it came with was grilled to perfection and I was able to swap the celery for extra cucumber.  The plate also comes with harissa which I wasn't aware of what that was.  It's supposedly a spicy dip but it's bearable, not like eating Indian curry.  Towards the end of last year I'd come here for lunch and had the pretzels, which were amazing and a fabulous seafood dish.

Overall this is a casual spot to kick back and watch a game, while enjoying great food and drinks.  The place is clean, there is plenty of seating both indoor and outdoor and the service is excellent!  I will be back..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly waitstaff, good food and great beers!  Stumbled upon Fate Brewery on accident, since we couldn't find the restaurant that we were heading for and found them.  I am so glad we did.  It was a very enjoyable experience with a unusual pizza that tasted great and a flight of beers that were also great tasting."}
{"text":"Great food and great beer! I've come here a few times and have had great service. I wish they'd get more people up front though. We always seem to arrive when the girl is on the phone and we awkwardly just stand there for a little bit. But, once we sit down, all is well"}
{"text":"We had a delightful meal that deserves recognition. We sat outside at a comfortable table as we perused the extensive menu. Beer is king here so we opted for a flight. 
Our server Matthew was terrific.  All his beer recommendations were spot on. 
All the service was terrific. Food came out quickly and done perfectly. 
We'll be sure to return soon!"}
{"text":"In town for spring training and stopped by here for dinner. Delicious house burger, fries, and by far the best \"clean\" tasting margarita that I've had in awhile. And by \"clean\" I mean it didn't taste like it was over loaded with sugar or added flavors for a house margarita. 

Our waitress, Mary, was great! Super helpful, nice, and very attentive! Definitely a must try. Will be back to inquire about their brewery tours!"}
{"text":"The beers are great, the location is awesome and the food is delectable. Especially their pizzas!! And I'm a pizza snob. I especially love sitting out on the patio. We ended up here on a busy Saturday night and while all the food and friendliness was totally on par, we had to wait what seemed like ages for our beers to come out. There were two gals serving the area we were seated, and a few in our group actually had to go up to the bar to order because our drinks never showed up. But I'm still leaving the four stars here because I have high hopes for McFate, and believe it was maybe just a really busy evening, or the gals were really new and I believe that what they lacked in service they make up for everywhere else. And definitely order the pizza."}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times since they have opened and it's gotten better each time - solid beers all around and good pub food. Servers are great and I recommend the Irish ale if you're thirsty and the soft pretzels and cumin spiced chicken wings for snacks.  Bonus points for it being walking distance from my residence."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and love it.  I love their beer and it never tried one I wasn't a fan of.  I have had their pizza and their burgers and both were delish.  My wife had the grilled cheese and wished it had something more than the cheese.  Maybe some brisket or something.  None the less she enjoyed it.  Its a blast sitting outside and the wait staff and bartenders are what you would expect.  Love that its dog friendly outside too!"}
{"text":"This place should show Flying Bassett Brewery how to run their business. McFate is the educated and knowledgeable brewer. There service is great, food prices are reasonable for the area yet delicious, half off pizza Mondays, and most importantly, great service."}
{"text":"Always great. A few wait staff need to be trained to be more friendly #girlwhofrownsandwontaskfororder. But otherwise everyone is great! Yummy beer!"}
{"text":"The food is great here, and the servers are nice, but we just had a pretty poor service experience. 

We waited 10 minutes and no one brought water or asked us for our order; we had to flag down Simone to ask them. 

We then ordered, and got the wrong fries (regular instead of sweet potatoes). We also never got silverware or napkins. We then ordered another beer, and after 20 minutes, it never came. 

Normally we like it here, but I think they need to hire more servers to accommodate the busy season."}
{"text":"We've been here 3 times now, it's not crowded, beer is good, 3.5 stars, their pizza is excellent, thin crust just like the pizza I've had in Italy 5 stars! Service was ok, not great, 3.5 stars, that could definitely be improved upon. Parking is good. Outside dining is nice, they have misters to cool the patio, a bit noisy from the road traffic, 4 stars. One of the better new brew pubs around."}
{"text":"We went here because we thought it was a brewery. It's a small, clean bar. I wasn't fan of their beers because most were hoppy or heavy."}
{"text":"Went in to buy a 32oz growler of IPA. My bill was $12. I said to the bartender \"wow so a full growler is around $24?\" I was informed that 64oz was $16. A FIFTY PERCENT markup if you want half a growler. Ridiculous. No one in town does this. So much for customer friendly."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and loved everything we had! Liz was our server, very nice and welcoming. Her beer flight suggestions were perfect. I had the fish sandwich which is served with a delicious dill tarter sauce and the side salad was lovely greens with their herb vinaigrette, delicious. Hubby had a goat cheese fig pizza which looked and tasted great and our other friend had a burger. The only suggestion is to order the fries well done. We started with the pretzel which is served with dipping sauces of mustard and cheese, Yum! We will defiantly be back as the menu has a little something for everyone!"}
{"text":"The beer is good, the food is above average, and the service is average, the only problem is that if you have a time limit, the service is slow. I go here for lunch and we cant always get in and out in an hour."}
{"text":"Came for a beer while my car was being serviced. Prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable. Win-win in my book"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome!  Good value for the quality.  Four in our party, two couples.  Guys had ales.  Food: Alaskan fish sandwich with mango slaw - perfection. Poutine fries - interesting and delicious.  The Grape Escape pizza - different and mouthwatering.  The Burger - mixture of brisket and hamburger - delicious.  The buns were even irresistible!  This was our first visit and we WILL be back : )"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was pretty good food was pretty good the fries were soggy but the salad and burger decent . Annoying waitress came over and all she could talk about was my bf accent on and on and on I had to hear all about it ..lame as I sit there waiting to place an order"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly wait staff, tasty beer, never a long wait. That's 5 stars all day long. The Mosaic single hop sour is fantastic if you're a sour beer lover. Recommend to all."}
{"text":"Love this brewery! Very spacious, good menu, and lots of TVs and bar space. Love the Jess pizza! Spinach artichoke dip is really good also. Great place to de stress after work. Only thing I wish they had was sour beer."}
{"text":"McFate is arguably one of my favorite places to spend your nights as a beer nerd or  as someone who ejoys supporting a local business.

The atmosphere is bright and takes notes from Chipotle and is nice but slightly forgettable which is a sin but not a pro. Honestly this is the only sin this place may commit so get ready for all the positives.

First thing is the beer: they have an amazing rotation and there is always awesome beers on tap and everyone should have something to drink here. 

Next: the food is absolutely awesome. I get pizza every time and it's just the right amount to share or have by yourself. It's about 14\" and is really solid. Pro tip: get the artichoke dip and ask for bread instead of the standard chips. 

Finally, the staff is worth their weight in gold. I've never had a bad experience with the staff and they care about beer being served here. Jessica absolutely amazing so if you get her and you have a bad experience, it's probably you. 

This is an awesome establishment and you should visit. Now. Like literally now. Go."}
{"text":"Last Saturday, I was in the area to go shopping at Plato's Closet next door. If you bring your receipt from McFate's, Plato's will give you $5 off. So I decided to take advantage of this offer and hit up McFate's for lunch. I was by myself so I sat at the bar.  The bartender informed my of all the specials for the day and came back shortly to take my drink order. However, once he served me my drink, he never came back, not until he handed me the bill. I never had the chance to place my lunch order. I sat there for a while, but got fed up and decided to pay my bill and down my beer. He took my money, but never came back with the change or the receipt I needed in order to get the $5 discount at Plato's. I had to ask another bartender for my receipt.  Then I went shopping next door with a grumbling stomach. Their happy hour prices on food looked great, too bad I didn't get a chance to order any of it."}
{"text":"One of the best places around. Even better this time of year with the Candy Bar Milk Stout. It's always a joyous time!"}
{"text":"Glad to have a Fate location closer to the east valley!  Always a great beer selection, good food and friendly service.  Fate South is at a great location with an awesome patio and outdoor seating area...definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Wow was this place was good! The food, service, iced tea, the ambiance....very happy I gave this place a try because it was awesome. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great patio - we went there on Thursday before a baseball game. Had a table right away -- we brought our dog-- and drinks and food very fast. The staff were nice and helpful. We have the truffle pizza, pretzel, and nachos. Everything was tasty and the beer was fresh. 

Plenty of parking and once again a very dog friendly patio. The patio was nicely designed too. Fire pits and what not."}
{"text":"So far great beers! Their own beers change out fairly often and they have other 'guest beers'. The pretzel was delicious and the pizza is good. Just having the spinach and artichoke dip now and it's alright. 

This place is nice and big and bright! Perfect for hanging out and watching games or enjoying the weather. 

The New Standard IPA is delicious!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots! Gorgeous place and wonderful service. Steve McFate is a true gem if you have the pleasure of meeting him. Beer is delicious, great selection. Also Food is amazing, not just pub food. Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"I got a fire burger, Moscow mule and fries...

The place was clean, atmosphere was inside was casual and inviting. The outside uses re purposed wood and creative ideas to incorporate the garden of phoenix into the patio.

Onto the food.. The burger was exactly what I wanted - medium, spicy, full of flavor, bun was soft and moist. The fries were like McDonald size cut but fresh. The Moscow Mule was a 9/10. Overall. I couldn't complain as everything was top notch for me and had a great experience dining there."}
{"text":"Loved it.  GREAT beer as always.  Food was very good and while I read through other reviews-our service was great.  We had no wait time on a monday night.  I suggest to those that had a less than stellar service experience during their first week of operation to go back.  It will be worth it!! CHEERS.  My only negative is no changing table in the rest room for the little ones."}
{"text":"McFate never ever disappoints. I typically enjoy the traditional brewery experience -  a rather small building where you go to chat over a beer and a beer only - but McFate is one of the only exceptions. The beers that I've tried are wonderful and the food is always spot on. Not to mention the service is spectacular as well! My favorite beer is by far the Pueblo Vienna lager, but be sure to get some tasters. There's bound to be something for everyone here! Whether you're here for a meal or just a beer, order the tater tots. Seriously. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Third brewery of the hop- great food, great service,  and the beer was awesome! We ordered practically the whole menu from their pizzas, appetizers, and burgers. Their sample flights was reasonable along with their prices. This place is a must !"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza (half off on monday nights), dog friendly patio, and just a great all around vibe. Also recommend the burgers."}
{"text":"Awesome place we were in Tempe for 2 nights and went to it both nights!!! The special pizza was amazing! Highly recommended even the service was great and my husband loved the beer selection."}
{"text":"PROS
Blonde ale
Great patio and modern space, lots of TVs so we could watch football

CONS
Service was very slow 
Our friend was not fond of the pilsner...\"cat pee\" description was used

Meeh - we ordered poutine for the table just to snack on with our beers and there wasn't enough cheese curds and the fries weren't seasoned all that well

Being our first time here, it was a chill place to meet for a casual drink with friends and family that were in town for the holiday. Being Chandler folks, we will probably not make the trip here again if it was out of our way."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dinner spots. Prices could be cut a little bit, but overall the place is awesome. Try the chicken club."}
{"text":"The first stop on our Phoenix brew tour was the South Scottsdale location of McFate Brewing Company. We had a couple of flights and lunch to pregame before we headed over to Sloan Park. They were out of couple of beers, but there was a nice range in styles and a couple with unique flavors that I've never had before.

There were plenty of seats at the indoor bar where we answered opening bell with a flight of beers at 11:10 ante meridiem. But with the weather being near perfect, we probably should have grabbed a seat outside or stayed at the bar but on the portion that extended outdoors. Since we came right at opening the spacious interior was squeaky clean with concrete floors, a high ceiling, a clear view of the brewing tanks right behind us, and plenty of flat screens to watch the previous night's NBA highlights. The bar was open to the outdoors and we felt a nice breeze and had ample fresh air.

With 17 of 19 McFate beers on tap, we sampled nine of them through flights of three beers. And I can say all of them were quite tasty. The Oatmeal Crisp Lager wasn't available but the first I had my eye on. The Hatch Chile Gatos was one beer that stood out with me with its chile aroma and spicy finish that lingered for about 15 seconds. The Continual Soiree Scotch Ale had a distinct whiskey flavor, but with an ABV 9.0 it'll hit you pretty hard.

For food, we snacked on some spin dip and a Grape Escape Pizza which had a nice combination of sweet and sour with the grapes, goat cheese, and balsamic glaze. With the wide selection of beers, they could help out the customers by suggesting suitable pairings for the food on the menu.

The bartenders were super cool and gave some good recommendations. By the time we left, the brewery was almost at capacity with the lunch crowd and they still managed everything pretty well. With three flights, two more pints, and food the total for the bill pre tip was $54. This was a very worthy first stop for the weekend and with an ever changing small batch brew list, I wouldn't hesitate to return to try other things McFate has in store for beer drinkers."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today, brought along our new dog.    The host was quick and attentive, he brought over some water for our thirsty pup right away. The food was on point! We ordered the Caesar salad and beer battered chicken over fries. The chicken was super tender and perfectly cooked, the batter was crispy and super tasty. I would have given them 5 stars if the server was more attentive. She wasn't bad but she wasn't very good either... maybe a training issue?"}
{"text":"I have only had food here maybe once or twice and it was good. I've mainly drank here and Fate aka Mcfate has great beers! Glad the lawsuit is behind them now. I will continue to support a great local brewery."}
{"text":"Very good beers. Love the pizza nice they have gluten free pizza. Easy to find location. Had to change the name from \"fate\" because another brewery alreay was named fate"}
{"text":"We went to McFate this weekend for the first time on a group outing with our social group.  One of the members of our group is a regular here and recommended it and even organized a tour of the brewery for us.  Their set up is really awesome and the tour was fun and very informational.  We also sampled flights of beers and enjoyed the pretzel appetizer (which came with the BEST mustard I have had with a pretzel appetizer EVER) and a yummy beer cheese sauce.  Then we had salads and pizzas, everything was very tasty and the beers were delicious.  I've been on quite a few brewery tours, small and big and enjoyed quite a few flight samplers at micro breweries.  The beers here are so distinct and full of FLAVOR.  Just a really great experience, we will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"This was our second attempt at this restaurant. First time I was there we were ignored, had a bottle of red wine splashed on us because at the next table over the server thought it would be fun to have the very drunk girls pop the cork...not so much when it went spraying everywhere. Red wine and white shirts don't go. But...it was a super busy night... so we tried again. Every place has one of those nights. So on Monday at 4:30 we went back. Hardly anyone was there, we thought great!  We will get served. WRONG. Selena was our server. Not only did she make it very clear she was bored, and totally uninterested in helping, but she also treated us like we should be so thankful she was even there to help. First off: I am aware this a beer bar, but she said that they had a full bar as I was uninterested in having a beer, great(!) I asked for a raspberry vodka with splash of tonic. The immediate response was attitude and that they only have real drinks. Ummm okay....  She then walked off with my water order and my partner's beer order. When she dropped the drinks off she turned away the moment they touched the table. We had to ask for her to stay so we could order an appetizer!  WTH. Appetizer was brought out and she never came back to see how it was or if we wanted anything else eat. FINALLY when drinks were gone and appetizer gone, she asked if we needed anything else...in such a way that very much indicated she wanted us gone. Don't worry Selena, we were done. As we had so much time waiting for anything it did give us a chance to observe. Most of the waitstaff seemed to maintain this same level of bordness and irritation. No smiles, not genuine, lots of eye rolling...not pleasant. This whole thing was super sad as our first trip the food was amazing and I was looking forward to it. The first time was grilled cheese sandwich (best ever) and the second time, even though it was only spinach dip, it was spot on. That said I have not desire to go back to a place where the team members are rude and snubbing people seems to be the MO. Don't change your food...change your waitstaff."}
{"text":"Wow! There truly are not enough words to describe the experience my friend and I had last night at this McFate's. I've heard so many great things about it. We've both been to the location on Shea and loved it. Since we were closer to this one after going to a play, we decided to stop in and get the churro pretzel. My friend also wanted to get a growler. We walked in at about 8:50 pm. 

We were seated immediately, but that's where the good ends. The server we had could not have been more incompetent if she tried and I think was in part due to the management (whom we never met despite all of the problems). First she came over, asked for drink orders, got my friend's and forgot to get mine. This was never gotten, by the way. Then, we told her we wanted the churro pretzel to which she asked if we wanted one or two and she walked away to place the order. 

After a good amount of time waiting a guy walks to the table with regular salted pretzels. We informed him that this was not what we ordered and explained expressly what we did ask for. He proceeds to tell us that that is not on their menu at this location, only at the Shea location. We were perplexed why we had been waiting about 15 minutes for something they don't carry. He gave is other options, but that was one of the reasons we went there, so no thank you. Then my friend was pondering her growler and waiting for our server to return, our server appears with a plate of pretzels. Our hope is that they were the same one as before, we actually questioned this. The kicker was when we said we wanted the churro pretzel her response was \"Yeah, I heard you say that before, but I didn't know what that meant.\" So, instead of asking us, the manager, a coworker, you just place any old order and assume we'll take it?

At this point, my friend and I are set to go to the other McFate's, but she needs to order her growler. So, she orders her large growler and asks for the check. We wait another 15 minutes in which time a small growler is placed on the table by another server. When she returns with the bill she goes \"Wait, didn't you order the large?\", walks away and comes back to say \"I must have put it in wrong, I'll get the right one.\" She came back briefly to inform us that the manager was only going to charge my friend for the small. No, acknowledgement, no apology, no manager even coming to the table after all of these errors? But they didn't stop there. 

After 20 more minutes of waiting, I caught a server walking by our table's attention and told her we were waiting on the growler. She immediately walked away and brought it back. A good manager would have offered a better visit next time come and talked to us, no he stayed hidden. I should mention that we never had our server come back to our table and she never once apologized for all of issues. My money is not owed to anyone and if this is the service we get by a lame manager and incompetent servers, we will either keep our money to the Shea location or another establishment all together. It should be mentioned that this whole process took so long that it was well after 10 by the time we got to the Shea location and neither of us wanted the pretzel anymore. It would take a lot to make up for this terrible first visit."}
{"text":"It's great to find a brewery that has a diverse offering of both predictable and unpredictable brews. It's especially nice to find a place with great brews AND some food options that are somewhat healthy. The Ahi salad was generous and tasty."}
{"text":"We're new to Scottsdale and have been checking out a ton of brewery's and restaurants throughout the area. I randomly drove by McFate Brewing Company a couple week ago and finally decided to give it a try! First off, our server Jordan was amazing. Customer service is more important to me than anything when eating out. Secondly, we wished we hadn't already eaten because everything on the menu looked amazing. But we ended up getting their buffalo wings which were incredible! Lastly, their beer selection is on point! We're big IPA drinkers, but even their ales were delicious. We highly recommend this spot! Good food, drinks, and customer service at a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I met my AOB buddy's S, S & T here, my choice. I saw the menu of the North location online & it looked good. S & S arrived before me & since I was in a time crunch I called S & told him what to order me.  He said what I wanted wasn't on the menu, huh? He read me the menu & I made another choice. So evidently, the two locations have different menu's. No bigee.
Fate South has a beautiful building. Large, modern design feel. Nice addition to this area of South Scottsdale. Parking is on the north side & there is a lot of it. 
Here's where some may get confused. There is an entrance on the north side, where the parking is and there is an entrance on the east side, facing Scottsdale Rd. If you enter via the Scottsdale Rd. doors, make sure you don't head into Plato's Closet by mistake. You can use either entrance but the door facing the parking lot lets you check out the brewing room as you move in to the dining room.
Once inside the dining room you'll see the cement bar, super high ceiling and groove on a casual industrial feel. This space is VERY open which of course translates to noisy. On our visit the noise level was moderate but appropriate for a brewery restaurant.
Just after I arrive & find S & S our lunch arrives. I order a drink which our server brings me right away. The service was attentive & pleasant.
S ordered the Roasted Garlic burger with tots ($10). He commented that he didn't taste much roasted garlic & the patty, being \"smashed,\" was a bit overcooked. He liked the tots however.
S ordered the Fate burger w/ simple salad ($9). She enjoyed the burger as prepared, thought the salad was decent for the $ and gave it a thumbs up overall.
I ordered the Fire burger w/ sweet potato fries ($9). Not sure where to start. This is a burger my 9 year old son C could put together but I digress. I'll start with the positive. There was no upcharge for the sweet potato fries. Nice touch Fate. Umm, that's it for the plus's. On the negative side; the patty was small, didn't cover the bun and was a bit overcooked but passable. The sliced raw Jalapenos were sitting on the patty covered with a slice of cheddar (?) cheese but they impart only heat and not much flavor. The entire burger was just uninspired. 
Great location, loud, good service, average food at best. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"A real chill brewery located in Scottsdale. 

It's large with plenty of seating indoor and out. Being that it was a brisk evening we opted for the warmth of the indoors near to the bar area. 

My immediate reaction to the bar was \"what's that stench?\" - the musty smell of the washing machine on the other side of the bar was almost unbearable. The intermittent steamy facials from the dishwasher were also not so delightful.


Their three samples for $6 was quite the steal and the selection of beer alone is worth the stop. Craison (a cranberry saison -whaaat!) was different and kind of delicious. Hands down favorite of the night was the Hatch Chile Gatos beer. I'm a sucker for anything that has a little heat to it. It's not spicy, but does have a little kick on the back end. Don't be shy and try a glass! 

The man and I shared a burger and the spinach dip, which hit the spot. I just really wish they'd get that dishwasher issue fixed. The smell was just ick. And when a large part of beer tasting involves smell, it really kind of messed it up for me!"}
{"text":"Solid brewery with a good crowd. Twists of Fate pretzels are a must. Grape of Thrones brew highly recommended--"}
{"text":"Yes!  Service outstanding, brewed beer on tap selection respectable and food very good!  Will be back.  Note: only 3 IPAs on tap but still- worth a trip for a beer lover.  Took 3 teens there and although a full blown brewery was very family friendly :)"}
{"text":"Awesome location! Beautiful facility.
Happy hour was great. Loved the 2 for 1 draft we got.
We weren't crazy about the pale ale but the pilsner was incredible!"}
{"text":"Great spot if you want to grab a bite or brew. Our favorite menu item is the Grape Escape pizza! The Jess pizza is good too though! Beers usually have a little something for everyone and change somewhat regularly. And when in doubt, they have wine or cocktails instead. Great open patio space with bags if you are with friends. Generally good service, and fast delivery of food and drinks. Worth a stop in! They have a great private event space in the back too!"}
{"text":"As big a fan of the original Fate North location as I am, I knew I'd enjoy my experience at the new Fate South. But I didn't know I'd LOVE it as much as I do. 

The space is HUGE, spacious and beautiful. You can walk in through the front, or, you're even invited to pass the barrel room and the brewing space by coming in the side door. I love to walk that route and see what the awesome brewer is cooking up next for us :) 

Fate's owner Steve is a huge supporter of the craft beer scene here in the valley so its no surprise that they were recently named one of the best beer bars in America. As a result, Fate threw a fan appreciation event on Saturday, which was my most recent (of many) visits here. Even though the place was packed with wall to wall folks and standing-room only, the staff was all smiles and was working quickly and diligently to keep the beer flowing and the bellies full. They really did a great job and I know my friends and I loved trying so many of their offerings for only $3 on that day. 

The menu is awesome here, a full kitchen offers more variety but also more chances to miss the mark - Fate South does not make that mistake though. I usually get one of their awesome salads or the chicken sandwich. But if you really want a treat, go for the pretzels and beer cheese. This is the kind of warm, salty, butter goodness that cheat days were created for! Hop you enjoy Fate as  much as I do, and check out the North location and their awesome pizzas!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS SPOT. Gorgeous facility - dog friendly on the patio!! I have been here several times and have always received great service - actually, better service than some high end spots in scottsdale. I absolutely love their pizzas and wraps. This is NOT like any other brewery in Scottsdale - All of the management is professional, friendly and humbled. I love the \"come as you are\" vibe here. Arizona needs MORE Fate Breweries. Definitely one of my favorite places to go with friends."}
{"text":"I stopped in one evening for dinner and drinks with some friends last month. I was really excited to try McFate because I was eyeing it for over a year. My group had to wait a little for a table and then we were seated outside, which I really loved! The patio atmosphere was great.

We waited for awhile for someone to greet us. When Jesse finally came, he took our drink orders. Maybe another ten minutes go by and he asked how we were and realized that he forgot the waters. When he came back with the waters he apologized for the bar being backed up, which is no big deal. At that moment, we started putting in food orders. He got through half of our table then turned around to the assist the table behind us and didn't come back. We were incredibly confused and thought he seemed off that night. So we had to flag him down after walking by a few times. Our drinks finally came out, some wrong, which we were charged for, but didn't want to bother with the hassle. Through out the dinner, two orders of food were brought to the table that weren't ours, but when our food came, it was all correct. The bills on the otherhand, were jumbled. 

I was very unimpressed with the service, the cocktails were mediocre, and the beers were good. If I'm back in town, I will give it another chance."}
{"text":"A cool place to hang out and have a beer. My girlfriend ordered a flight of 3 beers and the Irish Red was the best by far! The other two in her flight were pretty good, my hefeweizen was good. They have a very open-air restaurant and an outdoor seating area that reminds me of a beer garden. Outdoor patio is dog-friendly (awesome!) and there were a few dogs hanging out with their owners there. We tried the pretzels which were pretty big (you can either get one or two, not a big price difference), and it comes with queso and mustard. I felt like we were visiting Germany again!"}
{"text":"Love this place, right next to my apartment amazing grill cheese that is unlike anything ever. Found this on Yelp after reviews best decision of my life. Jordon has a handle on the table has beers right when we order them. Nachos with chicken is a must with chili is hands down the best I have had. Fateful IPA and Fatality IPA are my favorites. Service is spot on every time. If I can say the best brewery in Arizona this would be it. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Hubby says 4 stars, I say 3 stars so we will give it 3.5 stars officially. 

The design and atmosphere are great, we enjoyed sitting on the patio albeit the chairs made for persons with smaller tushies than ourselves (kinda feels like the chairs are pushing you out if you don't quite fit). 

Our server was well attending and friendly. Our drinks and food came out in a timely manner.

I had a $10 Chardonnay (I picked one of the more pricey options, but didn't find it to be worth it, wish I would have just gone for one of the $6 options). My husband enjoyed their beers (as usual). 

We split the bistro melt (gruyere + cappicola?) with tots as our side. It did the job but there was nothing special about it (except maybe the garlic salt they are putting on the tots? I did like that). We kept seeing a chicken club sandwich of some sort going by, and it did look delectable.

We will go back again and try different food (and different drinks for myself), but for now I'm neither impressed (other than the look & feel of the place) nor disappointed."}
{"text":"We really like McFate Brewing. Right on the corner of N. Scottsdale Rd., it's easy to get to. The beer is fabulous - try them all. Heavy on the IPAs in terms of selection. Their food is AWESOME. Their pizzas, sandwiches and salads are fresh and flavorful - but their tater tots? To die for. Especially if you love tater tots, because seriously, who doesn't!"}
{"text":"Two visits this month and more to come. Really enjoy this place.

Atmosphere - Great time to visit the South location because it is an indoor/outdoor location. A combination of an outdoor patio vibe, large bar and indoor seating. I really like the large concrete indoor/outdoor bar where I've made my perch on both visits. The only drawback is the proximity to Scottsdale Road, which can make a little noisy when the Harley Davidson weekend warriors go by.

Service - I'm indifferent about it, because that is how they treat the guests. They are attentive and manage the orders well, but their attitudes are, well, not very friendly. They aren't rude but they can lighten up and be a little nicer to the patrons. Again, I've sat at the bar both times so that is directed to the bar staff.

Beer - They brew so really really good beer. It is innovative and I've been working my way through their menu. I also like their guest taps which include other locals like the Huss Brewing Magic In The Ivy Ale. 

Food - Beside their beer the bites will bring you back. Before I go over the items we ordered I'm going to give a thumbs up to one of the side dishes, tater tots. Best I've had in a long time and one of the reasons I came back. Roasted Garlic Burger - Great execution, good flavor but my only reason not to order again was the mushrooms. I would have preferred them to be caramelized and warm, I didn't like their cool temp. Grilled Cheese Please - Hard to find a grilled cheese with Muenster on it but this place has it. Added bacon and it is a killer sandwich. Ribeye Steak Sandwich - Love it on the Ciabatta bread. The steak was tender and love the char. 

There is a lot on the menu and I look forward to trying more of menu, and a few beers also."}
{"text":"Pretty lame cranberry salad. Had to tell them goat cheese was suppose to be on it. For $10.00, it's not worth it. A few cranberries and a few red onions on top of spinach. Oh , and then they brought out about a tablespoon of goat cheese after I told them it was suppose to be on there!  Hopefully their beer is better . I don't drink beer but, the lemon martini was good!"}
{"text":"Second location for this Brewery. They did a little name change but kept everything the same. This location is much much larger than the original. Plus has a much larger menu with a great patio. Definitely worth coming to check out. Great quality beers that are constantly rotating. Also has some guest Taps bottles as well."}
{"text":"Would recommend their poutine, wow its great.

Great scenery. Didnt have a problem with service during my visit."}
{"text":"you should try that garlic truffle pizza. it's super garlicy and super truffley."}

I went on Yelp and used their Waitlist Skip/No Wait thing to sneak my way ahead of the list.  I saw a lot of surprised faces from those waiting for a table.  Haha, it pays to Yelp, y'all! 

The beers and food are pretty fabulous.  Pair that with an open and airy floor concept and you have a winner!

The Twist of Fate [bavarian pretzel(s), house made beer cheese, spicy mustard] was delicious.  It was warm and toasty and while that spicy mustard is super in your face, the real winner is the beer cheese.  I used that for my fries too.  Yum!  I also had The Truff Diver, don't be dirty folks, pizza [olive oil, mozzarella, mushroom, parmesan, cracked egg, fresh arugula, white truffle oil].  It is a peppery arugula explosion that pairs perfectly with the salty Parmesan and earthy mushrooms.  I wish the egg was more runny but whatever.  The flavors melded so well together.  The Reuben sandwich is also respectable and buttery. I enjoyed how the sauerkraut wasn't overwhelming and anytime I can get a perfect toast on rye bread makes me happy.

The two of us had a beer flight each for $6.  We did the Pick Three and I knew I had to get the Hatch Chile Gatos for Todd R.  If he likes it, I'm sure I will too --- and I did!  I guess the guy really knows his beer as much as it kills me to admit. ;) I also had the Oatmeal Crisp and the El Ultimo Mexican Hot Chocolate Stout.  The Oatmeal Crisp wasn't anything crazy but the El Ultimo Mexican Hot Chocolate Stout was bomb.  It drank like a meal and was insanely heavy.  I can't imagine drinking a full glass of this.  Give me the El Ultimo Mexican Hot Chocolate Stout and the Hatch Chile Gatos every day! I need to go back and try the Fruity McPunch and the McFate Strawberry Milkshake Wheat. 

TL;DR I'm a fan for sure and I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"The thin crust pizzas are amazing. After this second visit now I've had the sow sweet and Pablo honey multiple times. They are delicious in there own ways and I could eat the on the regular. I'm not a huge drinker but my roommate loved the brews! 

The only downfall I would said is the waitstaff I've gotten while there. I'm not sure if they are understaffed or I it's another issue, but it ruins the experience. Our waitress was inattentive and got one of our orders wrong. The wrong order was quickly fixed after trying to flag our waitress down for far too long. 

Overall I'd go again but maybe just do a pick up."}
{"text":"Went here for my Nieces bday.  They have an excellent selection of beer and the fire burger was Amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, not the best BUT the service was great! Jason was our server and he was amazing. Jason introduced me to my new favorite beer, Lost Coast Watermelon Wheat. Go Jason!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Fate Brewing for a meeting and although I didn't get to choose what we ate the pizzas that were ordered weren't bad. I'd say I've had better pizza but for a local brewery restaurant the pizza was good. Several different pizza's were ordered but the best one was the The Grape Escape with grapes and goat cheese, very different and very tasty. The beers are good too. I had Mcfate's Irish Red and my husband had the Ballast Point Even Keel Mango Session IPA which was fragrant and packed with flavor. The service was great too. Very accommodating since our group didn't have a reservation they made it work. Since we don't live far we will definitely return. It's a great local hangout, nice outdoor patio with nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about Mcfate! Some of the best beers we've ever had and we drink a LOT of beer! We had 7 different beers and loved them all! Our server, Dave, asked us our favorite beers outside of the menu and based on our descriptions he brought us the beers that Mcfate offers. He NAILED it and some! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The only reason for a single star is that no stars is available.  The beer was fine and the server Anthony was very good.   Went to the bathroom and the main bartender at 2 pm on Father's Day - med height with short beard- was in the bathroom while I also was there.   He did his business handling his junk and left the bathroom.  No water or soap were used.  Nasty..."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is what makes this place really near. The food is OK, I've been there a few times and it always is decent food. The beer selection and overall atmosphere is what keeps me going back. 
A lot of tvs to watch a game at, which is nice."}
{"text":"Have eaten here before and left a review, but it seemed to have disappeared! I've been coming here for quite a while once a month with friends and have always had a great experience until today. The server was all over the place with everything and really didn't know what he was doing and not sure if the cooks were awake, or not. One person in our party had a barely cooked burger served that had to be returned and I got a burger to go and asked for it medium and when I ate it later, it was well done. The cheese was also cold and not melted at all. It also took forever for us to get water and soda refills and when the checks arrived, they were given to the wrong people. Think we'll be going somewhere new next month. Not sure what was going on today."}
{"text":"I like Fate Brewing. I really really do. I'll be back to try some food next time, but did love the choice of beers on tap. There's something so welcoming and cozy about their patio and you may forget it's on a busy street - it's just that lovely."}
{"text":"My niece had the pork street tacos which she really liked. I had the buffalo chicken wrap. We were both very happy with our food. Good, quick service. I will eat here again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We found this brewery by \"fate\" and we were so so happy. The bartender, Jesse, aka Chewy  was amazing! He was the most friendly bartender we've had on our stay in Scottsdale thus far. 
He was super knowledgeable on all of the beers and was willing to talk us through our beer ordering.  He was a great addition to an already awesome bar. I would definitely recommend this place when in Scottsdale. 
Alsoooo, the food was awesome! We had the roasted grape salad, pretzels and the truff diver  pizza. We are headed to spring training sooo happy! 
Thanks Jesse and Mcfate brewing!"}
{"text":"Super cozy! They had it open air because the weather was so great. My husband and I split a caesar salad and \"the jess\" pizza. Pizza was a huge thin crust and the roasted garlic and ricotta were so so good. Great brewery food, lots to choose from. Everybody was real nice too."}
{"text":"Great service and happy hour specials. Pretzels are a must with two yummy dipping sauces - one was a wasabi mustard sauce and I couldn't stop eating it. The pizzas were good with unique toppings (grapes and goat cheese!). Tumeric butter wings were interesting but I wouldn't need to order them again. Love the patio which has a cute little grass space with games. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great place!!!

Their beer selections are very good. The IPAs are terrific, as was the Porter and Stout. 

Had the Fire Burger, I highly recommend that with the hummus app.  Lots of food at reasonable prices. 

The wait staff was extremely friendly and knew their stuff. 

Plenty of parking. So-So on the tv thing, but not a big deal. 

They need more XL tee shirts, haha. 

Lots of brewery options in the area, put this on the list."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for 10 minutes made eye contact with the bartender several times was not greeted at all.hostess was nice.i had to go ahead and leave after that it's was very noticeable.being a bartender a greet goes a long way..granted it was about 3 pm shift change.."}
