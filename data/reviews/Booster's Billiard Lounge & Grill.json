{"text":"My partner and I stumbled upon this great place after leaving Master Q because it was so packed with noisy and obnoxious players. We like places that are quieter and have less people, and Booster's was the place for us. There is a bar and they serve food, and there is plenty of space to sit and chill in between shots, and a great selection of music. I have no doubt that this will become a lively spot, but I for one love it's cozy feel for now."}
{"text":"good - chinese style skewers, appetizers,  reasonable price 1 pitcher of beer around $15. everyday special - look for tuesday chicken wings. thursday $1 each oyster. sat $.50 / grill shrimp. if you like pool. their table and cue seems like new and good quality. service also good !"}
{"text":"**CLOSED**  Quite an unexpected location for this bar where Babyface used to be.  It looks to be a mix between a bar/restaurant/billiard place and also plays sports on TV.  The interior is undeniably what remains of what used to be a club - booths, tall tables, back lights.  The seating at the booths are slightly uncomfortable - table is too high for the booth and the back is too flat and stiff.  From the looks of it I would not have expected the food to be any good, but the skewers are surprisingly great.  The waitresses barely speak any english but if you are able to maneuver the menu and get your order across, then the food is certainly better than expected.  I love the skewer cabbage, skewer lamb/beef/shrimp.  Most food items are a bit spicy here - almost like a northern chinese type of cuisine."}
{"text":"This is another new management. This time it's much better. The food is very good and the service is great. I will definitely will come back. You can play dart and pool too. It's a mix of everything and you can vape too."}
{"text":"It was a nice and fun environment with clean and new pool tables.  There were comfortable seating and TVs throughout the place and idarts were available.  The skewers were absolutely delicious and the other food items looked good, but did not have a chance to try.  The drinks were okay although one of the members in our party felt the drink they had was not mixed properly."}
{"text":"The grilled lamp and chicken were very yummy and we played pool game there. The spicy pork was nice"}
