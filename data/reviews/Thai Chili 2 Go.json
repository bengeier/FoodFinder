{"text":"Love the food but hate the wait. I ordered the drunken noodles....it's been 30 minutes already and I was told at least 10 more. 40 minutes for 1 order is ridiculous! Higley location needs to get its act together."}
{"text":"Ate there with the guys for lunch yesterday. Really good.  Attention to details.  Cashew chicken rice bowl.  I need to try the curry next.  Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. The first time I came I got the Pad Thai and it was one of the best dishes I have ever eaten. I was surprised later to find that I liked several of the other dishes even more, which I wouldn't have thought possible given how much I loved the Pad Thai. All the curries are amazing as is the Pad Siew, cashew chicken and pad prig pao. And the spring rolls are worth their own meal."}
{"text":"I ordered pad Thai chicken and they brought me Thai fried rice.  I was only customer .  No time to wait for redo. The only item where the last word isThai not first word."}
{"text":"I along with two friends tried Thai Chili 2 Go because we wanted some good Thai food and fast. I ordered the Pad Thai, the others order the Pad Siew... one with chicken and the other beef. We all were disappointed in our meals so we decided to try one anothers, but honestly we could not tell the difference. Each dish was mushy and had way too much sauce... all we could taste was sugar.  We will most likely not be coming back"}
{"text":"Great Thai food on a consistent basis. Love the Thai fried rice and Pad Thai. Can't help but order the Thai spring rolls while I am there too"}
{"text":"The employee behind the counter filled us in on the authentic rich history of the country very beautiful. Creates a great aroma around the restaurant. Although the food was put standing I was disappointed I was not able to give this restaurant 4 stars because of the slow service. Would suggest calling ahead for a more smooth transaction."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed this place. Yellow curry chicken is my favorite dish here. The wait is hit or miss, sometimes they are swamped and i have to wait a while. The management was really nice and at least acknowledged our wait. The food was worth it. I would recommend this place tonfriends and family who like thai.  It is surprisingly affordable as well."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this place. The bro about to take our order said it was going to be a 20 minute wait for food because they received a big online order. That online order is not my problem, there were no other people in the restaurant and we should not have to wait 20 minutes for food from a place that has \"2 go\" in their name. This place is out of bounds"}
{"text":"Zero stars! I ate the Panang curry last night and I've been throwing up with food poisoning all day! Save yourself and don't eat here!"}
{"text":"Thai Dumplings were good, with good flavor but could have been a tiny bit crispier.  The yellow curry (Thai hot) and the spicy eggplant (regular hot) were outstanding and exactly what we wanted and expected.  Having an option of brown rice is nice, too.  No knives (appear to be) available, so it would have been nice for the meat in out dishes to have been cut a tiny bit smaller, but it was tender enough to cut with a fork.  The gentleman who took our order was knowledgeable enough and the manager (maybe owner?) stopped by while we were waiting for our food to apologize for the wait (which wasn't excessive by any means).   We'd totally do this again.  And it's right off the freeway, making it easy to stop on the way home from work, too!"}
{"text":"Called on a Saturday night...and got voicemail!!! What???  Called back after a few mins and was asked if I could get put on hold. OK. Hmmm.  Not a good start.  Finally ordered my food and headed in to pick it up. The food was done on time. Then were only a handful of people eating in the restaurant and didn't see many to go orders, so don't know why the trouble on the phone.  Then I think I got the same girl as described above...hair was a mess. Maybe that's just how she is.  Ordered all my entrees with shrimp...wow, a whole 6 pieces per plate. Then the rice I ordered of course came in the little cardboard boxes. Both were not even closed to being filled up. Really?  Next time if I want to spend $50 on 4 items, I'll go next door to Zellas and order 10 pizzas!"}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I came in, there was only another person and us in the restaurant. It took 10+ minutes to get our food and when my girlfriend asked for chili sauce she was told she could not bring it to the front because they only use it in the kitchen. Most Thai places are known for having different types of chili sauces. If there's nothing else open and I'm really hungry then I'll come back other than that we will not be back."}
{"text":"I really like the coconut curry with tofu, it has a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"This exceeding my expectations for the Plata Quality/Quantity ratio! I ordered the Drunken Noodles that were amazing, could decide what proteins so I requested both chicken and steak (next time all steak). Good flavor, noodles extremely wide and all season well.  I also had the Chicken Dumpling fried to a crisp with great flavor, this was a great combo to eat.  I was also very lucky to sample my Awesome Daughter-in-Law's Yellow Curry with Chicken, will have to order that next time.  Gave it 4 stars because my Grand Daughter wanted to see more description of each of the Dishes...  Sr Plata's Granddaughter:  I ordered the Yellow Curry with chicken and found it very satisfying. The flavor was great, it was also had some spice. I rated it 4 stars due to the menu not giving much detail on what you may want to order. Next time, I would like to try a different curry or drunken noodles."}
{"text":"It is good, give it a try.  Nice to have another Thai option in North Scottsdale.  Hard to find places with quick service up here."}
{"text":"The food was excellent for a take out Thai place. Service was efficient and courteous. The wait time for the food is long during prime lunch or dinnner them hours, but the staff was good about informing us of the wait ahead of time. We would go back for sure"}
{"text":"Very yummy. Ordered the yellow curry with brown rice which was outstanding. Son ordered fried rice customized to his liking (no onion). Free Thai iced tea with a Yelp checkin which was awesome. Fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time a few weeks ago with some friends. Saw the owner was there working (running the register, serving food). The rest of the staff is nice and friendly. Good, clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is our most favorite Thai place and we spend a heck of a lot of money here. Drawbacks are that they are slow if you walk in. Timely if you order online. But if you do pick up - CHECK YOUR ORDER!  They left out ALL our rice and the drive back was not worth it. After speaking to the manager who was truly non-responsive to our plight I had to request a credit and she was so kind that we now get $2 off our next order. Oh, the generosity!! We may try another location at this point."}
{"text":"While the pad Thai was missing from our DoorDash delivery, the manager not only made it right, he drove it to my house himself. The added Bonus was that the food was fantastic. Eat here."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The curry is tasty, I ordered it medium and it had just the right amount of spice.  Also, the iced coffee was awesome!  Staff was nice and welcoming.  Definitely a new addition to our rotation!"}
{"text":"I called in an order for my husband and I.  Nick answered and listed the cross streets, and was polite.  He also gave substitutions for my AIP Paleo diet, which I have to do for health reasons.  He was polite and helpful.  Wow, I will call them more often for take out.  This is the location in Gilbert. Cross streets are Chandler Heights and Higley."}
{"text":"The food and service at this Thai Chili 2 go is always excellent!! We go out of our way to eat at this location, even though there is one closer to our house. They even have Vegan and Vegetarian options."}
{"text":"This place is average... not great but not bad either.  An ok place for to go thai food in a pinch.  Food is a little bland, but the portions are decent.  Price is good for the quality."}
{"text":"I see my experience has been similar to the other poor reviews here! The food is fine (mind you we only order the same two dishes each time), but the employees, especially the older guy manager, are absolutely INEPT. When you call you get voice mail (seriously, at a \"to go\" restaurant??) or get put on hold for 10+ minutes and no one comes back (AND when you complain to aforementioned manager, he says well the guy had a particularly difficult order on the phone before me and on Saturday night (at 5:30) they are SOOOOO busy so they can't answer... as if any of this changes the fact that they SENT ME TO VOICE MAIL! I asked him if they intended to return my message and all I heard was CRICKETS). If/When you get your order, it will be wrong. It will be the wrong or missing items, or if you eat in, they will bring your entree without rice because it'll be 20 minutes until the rice is ready, as if we should plan on eating the rice for dessert. Or... when you ask \"how long until its done?\" they will seriously look at you and say \"I don't know.\" Well... go find out!!!! It has been a long time since I have experienced such incompetence... so long I don't even remember having such a ridiculously frustrating and miserable dining experience. Oh, and FORGET ordering online. Although the system WILL charge your card, it will tell you it was declined so you try again and GET CHARGED AGAIN. But it will still not send your order to the restaurant! So you pay for two meals and get 0. The manager will tell you this happens all the time and it is the BANK'S fault, not theirs.  Really, all the different banks are having this issue, but the restaurant, the common denominator, is faultless. In fact this is the big problem with this place. Not only are they incompetent, they take no responsibility for such and blame the customer for everything. Pad Thai, not matter how great (and theirs is NOT great) is not worth this aggravation."}
{"text":"Got to write a 5 star review. They have good Thai food, and awesome staff. Also I won free food for a month, which was great. Awesome establishment."}
{"text":"Loved it! We usually drive to the one on Val vista and baseline and we're excited to see this one opening much closer to us. I like that it has more of a casual dining feel than the other one. Food was still amazing. My favorite is the Mussamun curry with chicken and my husband loves their Pad Thai and Tom Kha Gai soup. We still ended up waiting about 15 minutes for our food which seems reasonable to me. This is not a fast food drive thru place so don't expect warmed up food quickly. Not sure why everyone is disappointed about waiting a bit for their food. Quality takes more time than just serving up pre made fast food. Service was great too! We will be back often."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the food, so the 3 stars is for slow wait times that I regularly have when ordering from this particular Thai Chili.  Got frustrated with the wait times and having to hear the same apology from the guy that takes your payment after I go up and ask him how much longer only to hear his excuse, which is always the same (we don't have enough staff) (longest wait time has been 45 min. shortest has been about 15 min) Several times my daughter has gone to Chipotle Mexican (a few doors down), orders, brings her meal back to Thai Chili, eats her food, before I even get mine.  Have found it easier to order by phone and pick it up.  No, wait time for that."}
{"text":"Always tasty and incredibly friendly staff! They seemed to change their dishes for the dining-in option, which is unfortunate. The curry I ordered made the cardboard bowl soggy, and I was afraid it would seep through to the table. It also whisked away majority of the heat, so the top part of my curry was cold. I did order the curry Thai hot, and it was bland without any spice. The staff fixed it by giving me spices galore to dress it up, and it seemed to do the trick. I'm thinking they were having an off day, so I be back to see if anything changes. I also suggest changing the dishes back to what was there before."}
{"text":"This is one of my fave locally owned, fast casual Thai place!!!  ( try saying 10x fast ). Plus they serve delicious China Mist Iced Tea!!!  Panang is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"So mediocre. Tried the Pad Thai and it was completely unimpressive. Spring rolls were also mediocre."}
{"text":"I noted an ABC channel 15 smart shopper deal of the day, TC2go offered 50% off the entire menu as a grande opening offer. I stopped in after work and picked up a few things for dinner. The people working the front end appeared to be starting a long dinner crush. People were lining up thru the door the tension was rising in the kitchen, and the manager was making 'stat' requests. They rapidly fulfilled my order, even banged out 3 last second adds with ease. I loaded it up and headed home for the taste test. We ordered everything mild, and were happy we did so. I think the Thai style hot would make you head explode cartoon style. Penang curry, yellow curry are both really good. The coconut and curry both lead the pallet experience on these two. The highlight for me was the spring rolls, a bargain at 2 for $3, a little greasy, but everybody uses a paper napkin to soak up the extra grease on a pizza slice right? The filling was really good, onion, black pepper, salty ground chicken and secret spice....(I'm still  thinking about the flavor) warning, everything is alacart so beware if you say yes to rice it will add an extra buck to the bill. All in all I thought it was a really good meal for the price and will be back."}
{"text":"Holy crap. Why have I never been here before? It's Friday night and I'm craving something and boy did I get what I asked for. My family ordered Pad Thai with Chicken and shrimp. Fried rice with shrimp on the side and everything had medium sauce. I like spicy food. I like hot. I figured medium would be a safe bet. Our order took about an hour which was perfectly fine. Food was delivered when promised and properly labeled. One might into my medium spice chicken pad Thai and I was woken up. It's been fifteen minutes since I finished it and my is still on fire. My nose is running and my breathing is slow. But all of this in a good way! Haha man was I pleasantly surprised. Everything was so delicious. My father and I went for seconds it was so good. HIGHLY recommend to any Thai food lover. This place doesn't mess around."}
{"text":"Finally found a good little place with quality Thai take out. Pad Thai is very reminiscent of the great authentic Thai places in Brooklyn. My favorites here are Pad Thai and Cashew Nut & Veggies. Everything can be customized with a different type of meat, shrimp, tofu, or simply extra veggies. 50¢ charge for extra sauce - but go ahead and get it. Heat can also be adjusted per order. Mild is \"white people mild\" and medium is nice balanced heat. All this to say that if you're normally enjoying the heat in authentic Thai dishes, medium might be too mild for you. They deliver and you can also order online and have it ready by a certain time for pick up. Definitely worth trying and a great option for lunch."}
{"text":"Went to Blaze Pizza last week and while I was waiting for my pizza I couldn't believe how many people were going in and out of this little Thai place! So when I was looking to grab some food on the way home from work, it came to mind.  The menu was somewhat limited compared to what I've seen at other Thai restaurants. The counter staff was friendly and helped me place my order, I ordered a Thai fried rice with chicken (hot) and a chicken pad Thai (medium). Total was about $22 with tip. The food came out quickly, and in nice resealable containers, not the white Chinese food boxes.  Drove about 15 minutes to get home and the food was still REALLY hot. The Pad Thai was flavorful and a quite a bit spicer than I would expect for medium, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The Thai fried rice was very good as well but lacking heat according to my boyfriend.  Portion sizes were good but not overwhelming, I saved half of the pad Thai but there wasn't a grain of Thai fried rice left. We will definitely be going back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This place is really good. They have bowls, but not your typical bowl filled with rice and with a few pieces of chicken.  There are about 15 kinds of bowls filled with all sorts of things and you can add chicken, tofu, etc. Then they add lots of sauce, and if you get rice or noodles it comes on the side so you add as much or little if you like. Its a good portion even without rice.   This bowl concept is nothing new, but this is a bit different and its really good. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Place is nice and clean , inviting , i order the spicy eggplant with steam Tufo and rice noodle it was really good , stuff is super nice and friendly and the prices are not bad at all go check them out if you around Thank you"}
{"text":"I'm not normally one to write a negative review, especially as I am oftentimes the person to is in charge of responding to upset guests and, frankly, don't want to be a pain in the neck, but here it goes:  I have been to this location twice, the one in Queen Creek twice, and the stand alone store. I am, obviously, a fan. However, today's experience has made me want to be one of those dreaded people: the negative reviewer. I would like to say, however, the food itself is great!   Today, I attempted to call in an order. I say attempted, because I was placed on hold -for over five minutes- twice. After attempting to call back, I left a voicemail as well. As I was already on my way (and the food is legitimately very good! Especially at such a reasonable price!) I placed the order to go, and as I wait I am writing this review.   Every new place has its learning curve. Even one that has multiple locations, and possibly similar managers, has to learn what works for its location. What DOES NOT work is when a guest comes in to explain about a frustrating experience trying to get though (at a time when there is no line, and two tables full) and the management does not offer an apology. Or look you in the eye. Or let you finish speaking. Saying \"I was trying to juggle like six calls\" and walking away without making eye contact is NOT how to properly handle a guest situation. I wasn't rude, I wasn't asking for anything in return, I was simply trying to explain, to a relatively new business, that they should keep their customers well-informed if they are trying to place an order through the phone is a courtesy. I actually didn't even get that far before being interrupted. The manager, who at this point has actually started yelling at an employee who is merely trying to figure out where to put some plates, needs some training. To say it was frustrating to order food, food that I actually really enjoy, is an understatement.   That being said, the cashiers have always been very pleasant, and the one who I initially spoke with apologized after watching his manager ignore the situation and walk away. There is no name on the receipt for me to put his name on here, but he is a good indication of where you want your employees to go.   The food, as I mentioned earlier, is delicious. Large portions, with prices ranging between $5-$9, it is a great deal. I recommend the chicken Pad Thai, Thai hot. The dumplings are great as well.   I would like to see this place succeed and will be back in the future, although I am hopeful to see some improvements. Good luck, Thai Chili 2 Go!"}
{"text":"Best. Thai food. Ever.  Everything is great.  I order their fried rice and add chicken.  It's addictive.  Also the people who work there are so nice!  I usually do take out, and they always check my order and make sure my order is right."}
{"text":"Good if you have a craving for Thai. Enjoyed the spicy basil with chicken. Dumplings were okay. A steamed version would be nice. Yellow curry was tasty!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service.  Visiting Scottsdale for the weekend and this was a great option for us."}
{"text":"We have frequented the Thai Chili location on Baseline over the years, but this place is even closer to our house. We've even gotten Thai Chili 2 go through Postmates when we've felt super lazy.  The food seems to be all the same as the main location which is good. There's a few dishes I don't care for like the pad see ew, but the pad thai and curries are all knockouts.   Service is great just like the Baseline location. Our to go orders are always ready on time, and they're still piping hot when we get them home."}
{"text":"Very good food we have never been disappointed with the flavor and freshness. We recommend dining in or delivery through door dash, surprisingly delivery is MUCH faster than pick up."}
{"text":"When we've actually gotten our food, we liked this place. However,  the first time we ordered from here we ordered to go and they completely gave us the wrong meal. Didn't notice until we got home. Tonight we ordered online and were told it would be ready in 15 minutes. When we got there they said it would be at least another 20 to 30 minutes. Asked for a refund and we will likely never be back."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad experience, it's my first time stopping at this restaurant order some food to go to come more than 10 minutes and the kids that take the order in the front don't even have an ounce of personality. Food is just ok. I won't be coming nor will I be recommending it......"}
{"text":"My  friend keeps having me meet her at a little family owned Thai place stating \"we need to support them when we can\" BUT the food at Thai Chili is  SO much better !! I'm ditching her next time she wants to go there and I'm coming here! SO freaking good!"}
{"text":"Expressing a sigh of relief that the reviews have gotten so much better since they first. Based on the first reviews that talk about poor service and some mediocre food, it seems that they have ironed out the new restaurant kinks. Since this parking lot is ridiculously small for the large amount of eateries, we were pumped to see that there is online ordering and delivery available. So many options to customize (adding veggies, extra meat, cashews, etc.).   We ordered Pad Thai with chicken, carrots and zucchini and massaman curry with broccoli, carrots and chicken. The estimated delivery time was slightly over an hour (order long before you need it) but was delivered in 30 minutes, piping hot. The driver was very friendly and they got our order-even with add-ons- correct. They gave us a little serving spoon and forks, which was helpful.   Most importantly, the food was very good. Great pad Thai, which was just slightly sweet and had an abundance of chicken. I like it better than Tum Nuk down the street, although you do get a smaller portion here, if that matters to you. They forgot the peanuts, however, which was a slight bummer. The massaman curry was creamy and had just a slight kick (medium spice) and was great with the veggies added. We were able to request brown rice.   Looking forward to trying this place again!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food for when you're on the go. I ordered my favorite (pineapple curry). I didn't think to call ahead, but I only had to wait about 5 minutes to get my food. Will definitely be back when I'm on the run."}
{"text":"Really good food, its the reason we come back but after tonight Im not sure if we will. We came in at 7:00pm to dine in. We did not get our food until almost 8:30pm. The table behind us got so tired of waiting they left asking for a refund. This has always been a problem here and im not sure why management does not address it"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and I'm very impressed.  We had four different entrees and everyone loved their dish. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I used to come in here on a regular basis. The food is quite tasty and reasonably priced. The restaurant is clean and open. But I bought a gift card at Christmas time and since then have not been able to use it. When I am in the area and think about grabbing something to eat, Thai Chili usually comes to mind. No matter the day or time, there seems to always be close to an hour wait for food. I realize that they have many online orders to prepare. But seeing how this has happened on multiple occasions, maybe they should staff accordingly. There are other places to eat in the area that don't run this long of a wait. I just really miss being able to stop in and sit down without needing an extra hour to do so."}
{"text":"Like the name of the restaurant says, \"to go\" is the focus. They offer seating but it feels like a lightly decorated school cafeteria during world diversity week. The food was good and for the price, you could go to a more traditional \"sit-down\" restaurant.  If I wanted Thai food fast - I would recommend this establishment. Everything was clean and the staff was helpful and friendly.  According to Eric, the manager when we visited, he advises to call 30 minutes ahead for orders to go on Friday or Saturday nights."}
{"text":"The food is great. The staff here are fantastic. One of the staff members here saw my daughter struggling with using her chopsticks and made chopsticks especially for her to learn. It was very sweet of him to do."}
{"text":"Horrible!  I used to really like this place, but after not being here for a while, it's really gone down hill.  Today it took over 10 minutes to get our appetizer.  About 15 minutes later my Fiancé's food came out and 10 minutes later my food finally arrived.  The beef in my Pad Siew was so over cooked, it was literally charred and smelled like burnt flesh.  Huge disappointment.  I won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place. I'm Vietnamese and biased towards other Asian foods (just kidding, kinda)...but this place made me LOVE  Thai yellow curry. OMG. Now I'm hungry just saying it."}
{"text":"Ordered by food over 50 minutes ago and still nothing. Slowest workers ever, how do they even turn a profit?  Another couple has been waiting a longer than I have. Horrible service, not worth the wait. I'm about to ask for a refund and take my business elsewhere"}
{"text":"Very delicious Thai food!!! I had Pad Sew at medium spice and it was awesome. Can't wait to go back and try other dishes. I wish there was a Scottsdale/Phoenix location!"}
{"text":"The staff at Thai Chili 2 Go was very friendly as I had never been in and they answered my questions. The food was pretty tasty, I had a the pad se ew, and the chicken in it was well cooked, the spice was spot on, and the noodles were great. I think they had a bit too much sauce in the dish making it a little soggy when I got home but overall for the price and close proximity to home I was very satisfied. I will be back to try other items and update accordingly."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the Pad Thai.  It was freshly made and was a huge portion (enough to bring home for lunch the next day).   We went on a Friday night and it was super busy.   For a fast food type place the service was good and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"In an area of predominantly fancy sit down restaurants. Thai chili to go is a low key spot to grab a quick, inexpensive bite to eat. There are about 15 different noodle options on the menu. The bowl I got was tasty. I ordered medium spice and my mouth was on fiya."}
{"text":"Love this place found it through uber eats and usually get the drunken noodles for myself and pad Thai for my husband.  Today was my first time actually going in the store and the pics of their curry looked delicious. Going to venture to try them at my next visit. Word of caution big difference between mild and medium spicy levels. Pick mild if you dont like it spicy, made the mistake of asking for medium last time and it was a little too much for me and i usually eat spicy foods."}
{"text":"I had the pad siew and it was very nice. I did the mild as this was my first time here.  As expected it was mild  The pad Thai we tried the medium  And it has a bit of a kick to it. The kick wasn't there with he first taste ...... but then the heat arrived. Very nice  The food came out piping hot and the service was great   Will come back"}
{"text":"Great food! Service sucked though. The cashier didn't know what she was doing, was EXTREMELY quiet and couldn't understand anything she said. Our food took almost 20 minutes until it was ready. We got it to go, but they asked us like 3 times if it was to go or for here. Annoying. Will return but probably just a different location next time!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times now. They have taken the most popular menu items from their sit down restaurant and offer them here. Food was everything I expected. From what one of the employees said, the same lady makes the spice for all their locations so that it why it tastes the same as the sit down restaurant. I have had the Pad Prig Pao, which was amazing for me, and also the Tom Yum Gai. My wife had the yellow curry chicken. I am not a fan of curry, but she liked it a lot. If you are looking for a sit down meal, remember this is a fast food place. There are some tables, but don't expect a quiet environment as there is a constant flow of people coming and going."}
{"text":"Place is amazing food is hot fresh and delicious! They are popping up all over the place in the East Valley! I frequent the one on Power and Ray! Service is friendly establishment is clean and food is fantastic  Still AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Great fresh Thai food. Thai hot was plenty hot enough. Thai iced tea was a little weird and that it was pre-mixed but it was still tasty. Highly recommend going back."}
{"text":"Called in my order for pick up. Got there and paid.  Waited half hour and no food. Come to find out my food was just sitting there and no one bothered to tell me my order was ready tho both employees saw me sitting there waiting. Got home and they forgot my rice and of course my food was cold. I ordered pad Thai with beef and there was both beef and chicken in it. Not a good experience!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy enjoy the food here. It's cooked fresh, flavorful, and can be made to whatever heat you prefer. I was thrilled to be able to get brown rice too. On top of all that...their iced teas are great! The coconut pineapple is to die for!  The only negative is that sometimes the heat isn't what we ordered (medium was super SPICY last trip) and sometimes their veggies are cut too big. It wouldn't be s big deal if they had knives but the plastic knives are too wimpy to cut the veggies.   Overall - we love it here!"}
{"text":"The service is terrible! The last  4 times we have gone in to sit down and eat they tell us that it's over a 45 min wait with no one sitting in the restaurant. I've never been to a restaurant where they cater to take out orders before actually customers wanting to dine in. Food is ok but not that good."}
{"text":"I ordered online and got an e-mail saying my food would be ready at 7:35. I get there at 7:35 and tell them the name of my order. They tell me that my food should be ready in 5 to 10 minutes. At 8 o'clock someone comes up to me and asked me what name my order was under, I tell them my name and he turns around and grabs my food that had been sitting up at the counter for who knows how long."}
{"text":"Our go to take-out place used to be Wok Box at Frank Lloyd, but since that close we really hadn't found a place we liked. We have now, this is it!  So far we've tried the Thai dumplings, the drunken noodles, and the red curry - they're all delicious. Super flavorful... just right!"}
{"text":"Restaurant had an enjoyable decor where we were able to eat and talk on a Sunday afternoon. The food we order was curry and drunken noodle with chicken on both items. It was quite delicious and I enjoyed the seasoning, vegetables and meat. I will definitely come back again because the service was excellent and food came in at a reasonable time. A must try for anyone looking for fast Thai locations and needing to pick up."}
{"text":"Nick was super helpful and brought out our food to our party of 4 very quickly. He also informed us of the ASU student discount and re adjusted our bill accordingly. The food was good and reasonably priced. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Thai Chili back to back for the last two nights. The price is right and the food has a lots of flavor. I had the drunken noodles with chicken. The dish was cooked to perfection, the veggies were fresh as well.  Solid customer service and the place was clean."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating take out from here for almost 2 years. The food is consistent, the staff is polite, and it tastes amazing. I can not recommend Thai Chili 2 Go enough!"}
{"text":"Always a quick, delicious, filling meal with a wonderful staff! My fiancé and I love coming here on the weekends, especially after a day of outdoor recreation. We always go for the Pad Thai and lately I've been getting the yellow curry with chicken which is delightful. The free Thai tea with check-in is an added bonus. It's the best we've had on this side of town."}
{"text":"This place is great. Got a Thai Iced tea and it was delicious! Ordered beef Pad Thai and it was amazing as usual, but the portion was a lot smaller than usual. But hey, the food is great and that is what counts, just wish I received the adult size!!!"}
{"text":"I had the pad siew Stir-fried fresh rice noodles with broccoli, eggs and soy sauce real good . Will go back"}
{"text":"Thai Chili way to represent!  I loved my food here the 5 times I've been! My go to is Drunken noodles hit with chicken.  The green curry was tasty too.  Keep doin what y'all are doing and thanks for bringing Thai to the people! #makingthaifoodgreatagain"}
{"text":"I do enjoy the Thai Chili location on Baseline so when I heard of the opening of this \"2 go\" location, I was pretty excited to have a Thai option closer to home. Since it is a fast casual rather than a full scale restaurant, their menu items are more limited. My favorites here are the Tom Kha Kai & Drunken Noodles."}
{"text":"Took us 30 min to get our food!!! Only a few people before us. They took forever to get food out!! For a place that's supposed to be quick 2 Go food!! Definitely ruined my first experience here!! If you are hoping for quicker food when you have groceries in the back of your car I would not go here!"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch at least twice a week. The food is hot and fresh and tastes amazing! The soda fountain is super clean and the bathrooms are spotless. 5 stars all the way around!! Pad Siew is my favorite and the dumplings are delish!"}
{"text":"Wow, its a pretty sad when I have to admit this fast food joint has become my 'go to' Thai fix.  The current state of affairs with Thai food in the East Valley is down right dismal, OK not as bad as our Chinese food ... but dismal none the less! With the nose dive that the original Thai Chiles on Val Vista & Nunthaporn's in downtown Mesa recently took, I was truly lost.   I suspect Thai Chili 2 Go works because of the very limited menu and everything is made to order. I have zero problem's with the wait time and find it totally silly to take the food to go as there's plenty of tables to eat your Thai dishes ... Hot, Fresh & Tasty ... the way it's meant to be.  Enjoy it while it lasts!!!"}
{"text":"All the food was amazing. My only complaint is the spice level was lacking. The spicy food tasted mild and the mild entree had no heat level at all. Next time I'll get Thai spicy for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this place! So glad they sent out a coupon when they opened or I'd never know about it. I have been here 3 times since they opened. Forget Pei Wei, this is my new go to. LUV this place..great Thai food at reasonable prices! Mwah!"}
{"text":"I love coming here on my break. Pad Thai is sooooo good I get it medium with either chicken or shrimp. I've also tried the Tom yum soup and liked that just as much just wish it came in a bigger size. Staff is always very friendly and to go orders have only taken at most 15 minutes."}
{"text":"GREAT staff!!! Facebook has a coupon for buy one entree get another free! Good until the end of January. I bought pad Thai, yellow curry and spring roll. The food is loaded with flavor and the restaurant is very clean and tidy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Friendly staff, bomb panang curry, decent prices, great portions, speedy and efficient! Plus the delivery...  Definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Went here for take out. It was great. Would come here again. Anxious to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Good food but 90 minute wait for one item is beyond ridiculous. Get your act together and maybe I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had gone to blaze pizza yesterday and saw this place, so today I wanted to give this new place a shot. I ordered the Pad Thai, and the guy at the cashier told me it'll be about 15 min. In which I was fine with. They gave me a number and I sat at a table.  After 10 min another couple sat next to me and their pad Thai arrived abnormally fast, so they set it aside just Incase. When the waitress came around again to give them some appetizer they said no that's not what they had ordered. So I mentioned that I had ordered that same appetizer and nothing yet, and that I had also ordered a pad Thai. She just nodded and went back to the counter. 2 min later comes back with that same plate for me, by this time the couple next to me said they got a pad Thai with shrimp but that it wasn't theirs so we came to the conclusion that it was mine. When the waitress came back I told her she had given my plate to the table Cadi corner to me, once again she had a blank stare to her and just said oh ok. Not sure how this can get mixed up (there were only 2 tables with ppl where I was at).   The food was decent, but not great. Pad Thai I ordered was very runny, and almost too salty.  It looked like soup towards the end of it. I'd give it more stars but I wasn't too impressed by the place.   Sad to say I don't think I'll come back."}
{"text":"Their shirts say \"skip the line order online!\" By the last two times I've ordered online whoever is working Togo forgets to print my order. So when I go to pick it up I still end up having to wait 30 minutes( my pick up time was 6:12 it is now 6:50 and people that placed their order in store AFTER me are now leaving with their food BEFORE me.) for my food which is what I was trying to avoid. I love the food here but they need to get it together. Another thing when Togo orders that are placed in store are ready they don't yell out the customers name I just saw a girl that placed her order after me food sit for like 10 minutes before they called it out. When the worker that handed her, her food he said \"oh I'm sorry they didn't call out your name it's been ready\". Like cmon."}
{"text":"This is our go to Thai take out place.  Fried rice and curries are great- lots of of meat, veggies, and spice.  Pad Thai is too sweet for our taste.  Pad see ew is seriously the best (nice char on the beef), as long as the chef doesn't have a heavy hand on the sugar.  Portions are reasonable for price! Please open another location in Desert Ridge!!!!"}
{"text":"I want to give props because I think the idea of the \"quick serve\" thai place is a great one.  I would love to see these guys succeed.  It's quick and affordable and the food is fine.  I've had the pad thai a time or two now and it's been fine.  Good, not great.  I will probably keep ordering from this place because it's close and good enough, but if another more authentic spot was in the vicinity it would draw my interest.  Curious to try a few more things and hope these guys do well."}
{"text":"I have been to the Thai Chili in Gilbert a few years back and I'm not sure if this is part of the same restaurant but it was a little different. Basically you have an option of what main dish you want and it's either a noodle, rice, or curry dish. They also have other entrees and appetizers you can select from. From there, you choose your protein and what spice level you prefer. I ordered the pad Thai and my wife ordered the pad siew. We really enjoyed her dish but both agreed that the pad Thai was not very good. It had a strange sweetness in the sauce that was not pleasant. It almost tasted like ketchup or sweet and sour sauce. Thankfully, when I told the employees that I did not care for the pad Thai and asked for the pad siew instead, they took it back no problem. Pad siew with beef was a great dish. Pretty reasonable prices for Thai food. The dishes ranges anywhere from 9-10$. If your looking some for quick Thai food and not really wanting to go to a full sit down restaurant then this is the place for you. Looks like a lot of people do take out here as well."}
{"text":"Good food.  Got the drunken noodles to go, but it took nearly 20 minutes to get my order (this after omitting an item after being informed it would be 20 minutes for that item...).  20 minutes isn't long to wait for good food, unless the restaurant is billed as \"2-go\".   If you are in a time-crunch you should dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good Pad Siew; I really only order that but everything else smells great. I eat here too many times in a week because it's that good. After my 42nd or 43rd visit, everyone started to learn my name. Customer service is top notch and they don't turn you away three minutes before closing. Good stuff and a little bit healthy to boot."}
{"text":"Oh how I have missed yummy Thai food! We got a coupon in the mail, otherwise we would have never known about this little gym in the south part of the Promenade shopping complex. Small space, but so far it wasn't so busy that we couldn't find a place to sit, even with how are huge baby stroller. Friendly young man behind the counter answered all our questions and took our orders. I got the Tom Kha Gai soup and my husband got the beef Pad Siew (after seeing other people's yummy pictures posted on Yelp). We both loved our dishes! My soup was extremely hot and it did burn my mouth, but that was my fault for being overzealous to try it too quickly. The portion sizes were just the right amount for both of the dishes as well. And you can't beat the pricing. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Hi. I came in and ordered the Tom Yum Gai soup because that's what I wanted. I did not get this soup. I got the Tom Kha one. I know that I specifically ordered the Tom Yum because that is what I wanted. I am now home and because I am 9 months pregnant, I am going to eat the Tom Kha one. I really wanted to like this place but since it was so difficult to give me something so simple as the correct soup, I am very disappointed.  Sincerely, Pissed off pregnant woman eating Tom Kha  P.S. Gave 4 stars because the food was great. Still pissed off!"}
{"text":"This evening we had the beef pad Thai, beef spicy basil and an order of spring rolls. Absolutely delish!! Everything was delightfully fresh and the entire staff was friendly and super welcoming. We will be back very soon! So glad we have a Thai place we can now go to in the neighborhood that tastes so good!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight for their first night open and they had buffet-style free food! Pretty sweet. The people working there were so nice. Good quality food at reasonable prices. A good selection but not a massive menu, since it is on-the-go. I was skeptical about how fast(ish) food thai would turn out but I was surprised by how delicious it was! The only thing I could eat at the buffet was the vegetable yellow curry and rice since the other dishes prepared had meat, but it was delicious! I would love to try all of the curries with tofu. The noodle dishes sound great too. Glad I'll have a yummy quick thai place just down the street now!"}
{"text":"Ok, so it's not the best Pad Thai I've had, but I wasn't exactly expecting that walking into a fast food version of a Thai restaurant. Pei Wei's Pad Thai is much better. Still, I like the concept, and I thought the interior was pretty neatly designed, Asian culture (images) meets modern American fast casual, with just the right amount of lighting. The wait time was a little longer than expected (about 30 minutes), but the manager (maybe owner?) working near the front counter was very friendly/talkative and seemed to take great pride in his business. The free Thai tea was a nice gesture as well. I may return to give a few more of the menu items a try."}
{"text":"Clean modern place that has good soup, good prices and good pad Thai. My hub really liked his yellow curry beef dish. We look forward to taking food to go again. It came home still hot.  New place in a fav spot The Promenade. Look for Coupons, enjoy."}
{"text":"Update: June 21, 2018 My wife just called to report that she's finally done with Thai Chili 2Go. Almost $10 for a Pad Thai dish that only contained barely a cup of noodles!! Say whatever you want about packaging. The value is gone!! The place was empty again. They reaped a ton of profits while they slowly reduced the portion sizes. Now the place is more empty when there used to be lines. Hope you enjoyed those profits cuz the customers are now gone and we're done driving 30 minutes for this betrayal of loyalty because of wanton greed.  Once in a while we might drive by to look for \"under new management\" sign. Probably not.   Used to be good. Apparently new management. Portion sizes have dropped so much the place is now empty on Friday evenings instead of packed the way it used to be.  The pad Thai and curry are delicious. But the cost compared to the revised portion size is driving away me and many others apparently.  I'm sure they got a nice profit for some months but they'll discover that it's hard to get customers back once you've taken advantage of their loyalty."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  Had the Pad Thai with chicken.  Requested that it was spicy (they called it \"hot\"), might be comparable to other places' medium. The Pad Thai had a lot of sauce, too much sauce.  The staff were very helpful and friendly and were happy to explain the menu.  I would go back again and try a few other things."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have ordered the green curry with chicken and white rice! Every single time it has had the same flavor and been delicious!! Zero complaints. The boyfriend orders the pad siew and would say a 3/4 because he wishes he had more broccoli or more flavor to his. He is also a slightly pickier eater but entitled to an opinion lol. My family and I think it's delicious and I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Exceptional experience. Personable, attentive & courteous staff. Best Thai food! LOVED the Thai tea! Thank you"}
{"text":"Thai rice is very authentic. Wait is not too long. Good food. Love the location as well."}
{"text":"I have ordered here 3 times. My husband many. Their food is pretty delicious when they can get the order right... we typically order online and they consistently get it wrong. One time we got Sue's order and half of our order. Then the 2 other times we chose add-ons for our curry dish and they weren't included. So they nickle and dime you for every single thing you order, but don't include it in your order. Their food is pretty good but I would encourage you to look over your items because they're great at charging you but not so great at getting their orders right."}
{"text":"Love the food here! The only problem is the slow service. I like to call in my orders now, because I know if I just walk in it will take over 30 minutes for my order to be ready. But even when I call in I come about 5-10 minutes after my food is supposed to be ready, and I'm still finding myself having to sit down and wait for it to be finished. Again I think the food is fantastic, but the wait for even 1 entree is ridiculous."}
{"text":"First time here and I have to say the food was excellent!  Would definitely recommend to anyone who is a fan of Thai.  I had the spicy basil with chicken, and it was among the best I've had in the valley."}
{"text":"The drunken noodles are amazing but BE VERY CAREFUL. If you order it Thai hot, you will be in pain like I was. So spicy I couldn't even enjoy it, I had to throw it out.  I was suffering and sweating. That level of heat is cruel. I've ordered the regular hot drunken noodles before, and they are amazing. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get quick Thai food. I ordered beef pad se ew and chicken panang to go. The food  had a sweet aftertaste that I was surprised with. I prefer the dishes be more savory than sweet, but it wasn't bad.    Overall, I may come back if I am in the mood of Thai food."}
{"text":"Great food, ordered to go and it's ready quick! I ordered drunken noodles with chicken, mild spice, zucchini and side order of white rice.  People are great as well!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent!  The food is always  fresh and tasty. The staff are courteous and  friendly.  Best spot in Gilbert for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Great concept of simple menu, counter service, and quick meal. The inside of the restaurant is clean and modern. Ordered the pad siew with beef and tom yum soup with chicken. The flat noodles in the pad siew were soft and well separated but the pad siew sauce was really sweet and threw the entire dish off. The tom yum soup had good flavor but was a tad salty. Probably wouldn't come back if there are better Thai restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Overall the dishes here are very good with reasonable pricing. Carry out orders are usually ready within 15 mins if you avoid the busiest lunch and dinner times.   Minus one star for their changing of carry out containers, 3 times in the last 4 weeks, and a possible reduction in the portion size."}
{"text":"We order this consistently... We seem to love it.    At least once a week, if not twice.   They make a killer Pad Thai, and just typing this out I think I'll probably orders some tonight.     I get the steak Pad Thai with Jalapenos and mushrooms and its seriously delicious.    Just enough heat, and the sauce is great.    My wife is an easy sell as she loves this place as much as I do.      You guys are killing it.  Keep it up!   If you keep making this type of food, we'll keep ordering it."}
{"text":"Holy smokes they never got my order right and I'm waiting forever!  48 minutes for one dish!   Food is subpar."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of hot food, this is the place you should go!   We had Thai hot- drunken noodles, it was really good and to take hotnesss to next level they provided us with their freshly made chilly paste, which was like cherry on the top :)   I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre Thai . The Panang with chicken was good . The two other dishes the spicy Thai basil and Thai chow mein with beef were just awful . I would stay away from the beef it was very chewy low quality and greasy . There are other Thai places with better food  Update owner willing to remake food . Will review again"}
{"text":"First time trying it out. Got the panang beef and pad Thai it was very good and the price is great. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai place. I got the yellow curry with chicken. Thai hot! And it was very spicy hot. Probably twice as hot as other Thai places I've been. But great flavor, large portions and good value. Place was clean, and staff friendly. Didn't have to wait. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious  Thai fried rice with chicken, drunken noodles, spicy basil, cashew nut and veggie, spicy eggplant all are yummy! The red curry is delicious, the Thai iced tea is like dessert. Also, you can add or delete anything that you don't want to your entree which is nice!"}
{"text":"Updated review!! So this place is quick to try and fix any mistakes they may have made. A great quality in a restaurant. No one is perfect anyways.. so I would now recommend this place. The food is pretty darn good!! Worth the long wait!!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and definitely a great option for Thai food in Scottsdale. Here are some of the dishes we've ordered: - Yellow Curry w/ Beef at Mild & Medium - Red Curry w/ Chicken at Mild - Pad Thai w/ Beef at Mild If you don't have a high spice tolerance, I would recommend the Yellow Curry because the Red Curry at Mild had an equivalent spice level to the Yellow Curry at Medium. We were a bit confused because the first time we visited, the beef was very high quality and was similar to what you would find in a beef stew. However, the second time, the beef was more of a typical flat beef you would find in beef w/ broccoli. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The team is not as friendly as the other location I go to.  Just happy to know the food quality is."}
{"text":"Awesome beef drunken noodles and yellow curry. Everything was hot and full of flavor. Curry had perfect spice and the coconut broth was very tasty.  They also do a really good Thai iced tea here so I recommend you try one if you are getting something a bit spicy. All of the staff were friendly and polite. A nice little discovery this place."}
{"text":"So excited they opened this place right next to our house! We love the Val Vista location and this place is right on par! We had the Beef Panang, and my wife had the massamun curry (I obvi ate some of hers) and they were both delicious.  we will most definitely be eating here often!"}
{"text":"First time here!  I ordered Pad Thai- extra egg, mild, sub carrots for bean sprouts & 2 egg rolls.   Reasonably priced, quick and helpful service, and the food quality is wonderful.   I will be back and am extremely happy I have a fast and delicious option for lunch."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, specifically the pad Thai. Personally, I like the sit down restaurant better but it's nice to have a to go option sometimes.   Although the food is good- the service at this location isn't great. They are very crabby and don't seem like they want to be there. When I ordered last, the guy at the counter just completely ignored me even though it was very clear I needed something. He went and got a drink from the fountain, checked his phone, helped the customer behind me before he even acknowledged me.   I like the food. So I'll keep going back."}
{"text":"Why go to this place when you can get authentic Thai food right down the road? I am a curry snob and their curry is very watered down and doesn't have nearly as much flavor as it should."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and Kim and Lauren had amazing customer service. Very attentive and caring to myself and my family. Wasn't sure what to think when I first went, will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here! Mostly everything I've tried, I've really liked. Just a few misses.   The spring rolls and the dumplings are both great. Love the dumpling dipping sauce but not a huge fan of the spring roll sauce. I love the Pad Thai Chicken, Drunken Noodles W/Chicken and the Red Curry W/Chicken.   I've tried the Spicy Basil dish and I wasn't a fan but my husband loves it. Also - we tried the Red Curry once with beef instead of chx and I really didn't care for it.  Overall - really good food and close to where we live so it's convenient. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because it isn't my favorite Thai place. I still like Mint Thai better!"}
{"text":"This seemed like a fast food type place and not an authentic Thai place. I guess the \"to go\" in the name should've tipped me off. We've never been here before and I don't think we'll be back. The food was very greasy. Hubby and I both got a headache while eating. I had the pad Thai, one of my favs, which had a weird flavor to it and it was so shiny from the grease. My boys love drunken noodles and usually aren't to picky about them, but they weren't crazy about it here."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum in my tum tum tum! Great food fabulous customer service & speedy delivery. Orders have always been accurate!  Thank you. Have a fabulous Friday and a wonderful weekend!  You made mine!"}
{"text":"Ordered panang and it was good but I ordered double chicken and got less then my wife hat didn't order double chicken... I went and asked the manager if it was the right amount and he looked at it weird and said... That doesn't look right.  Went in the back and came back to tell me it was a half pound of chicken they put in!  .   It was a joke and couldn't believe they wouldn't just add some chicken to the 4 pieces in there!  Customer service has a long way to go.  I would way rather eat at one of the others Thai places that has better customer service!   This one gets a one star from me."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery through grub hub! So happy to have curry and pad thai delivered hot and fresh without having to leave the house. We ordered Massaman, pad thai, spring rolls, dumplings, and basil beef--we were hungry ok?! We got everything Thai hot because others said dishes leaned towards the mild side. My husband said it was spicy but probably a 3, meanwhile my nose was running and lips were swollen so I wouldn't take his assessment to heart. Great spicy, lovely flavors, and not skimpy on the meat--can't ask for more, but we sure will order more!"}
{"text":"The food and Thai tea are great here, but man is the service lacking. The older man who took our order made us feel like we were an inconvenience to him; really unfriendly and unwelcoming. And then we waited over 30 mins for our food to come out, and it was a to-go order. Disappointed for sure."}
{"text":"When they say 2 Go they don't tell you it could be 20+ mins to wait for your food. Also, for waiting that long you expect to get everything you ordered. It must have been the B team working bc they didn't put our rice we needed with our order. Curry without rice is just soup. Food was mediocre at best. Service not so good."}
{"text":"I've never been a Thai person until my wife hooked me up to this place.  My first trip there I went super simple and got fried rice while my wife got beef Pad Siew.  While I loved mine, hers was beyond amazing.   The next couple times, we got the same thing.  LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Kim McCray is awesome! I have been here twice and she was amazing both times she was engaging smiled and to put in one word awesome! She is so wonderful and I could say she should be promoted too a manager and have a raise I will come here as long as she is the smiling and engaged person that she is I'm glad she is awesome"}
{"text":"We came here tonight for their soft opening with their free buffet-style food. They had fried rice, yellow curry and pad prig pao. I thought the yellow curry was super yummy with deep flavors and a touch of heat. Their fried rice was really good too.   The place is small but cozy. All of their staff members were very friendly and one of them stopped by to see how we were doing. Their prices seem reasonable but it is hard to tell since we didn't experience what their normal portion size would be like. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've dined here because if my past experiences. I returned to give them another try (6/10/18) and they failed again!  Please keep in mind that I've had a bad experience so I went in with a very mindful eye to closely scrutinize everything. This is an accurate accounting of my experience.   I walked into the restaurant with two friends and it was 2:36 PM and the restaurant was literally empty. Not a single customer in the dining room. I suppose at 2:36 PM there are few people having a meal. This made my observations easier. We placed our order and our receipt registered 2:39 PM. We had two dumpling appetizers and three entrees so the order was not complicated. By 3:01 PM we asked about the dumplings and were told they were being fried now. I asked how long do the dumplings take to cook in the fryer. The answer was about five minutes. To which I responded then why is it that we've been sitting at our dining table for 22 minutes and the dumplings are just now in the fryer? The associate told me that there were online orders placed before we got there so those orders were being filled first. Regardless of when we arrived it does not take 20 minutes to drop a few dumplings in the fryer basket! This could have been completed immediately upon our order being taken. Instead they kept us waiting! Then when the dumplings were finished the associate brought them to us with no plates or forks! She disappeared from the front counter so my friend had to go behind the counter and fetch us some forks. When the food came we were still eating our dumplings so the food arrived too soon after serving the appetizers. Apparently they do not understand what it means to serve appetizers and entrees.   I am completely finished with Thai Chili 2 Go! They had a second chance and blew it!!  Below is my previous review.   I have one star for poor business practices. The owners created a frequent diner's program where customers earn points towards a monetary discount once the customer reaches a certain level of points.  We earned enough points to have $10 off our next visit. Ironically our next visit came shortly after their frequent diner's program crashed. As a result of the system crash their administrator could not salvage all the data and to confirm customers' points and rewards. It has been more than two months since we learned of this system crash and a promise from management that they would reconcile the points manually and issue any credits to customers who had credits. Today, August 25, 2017, I asked about the progress of the system crash and its recovery efforts and I was told the owners cannot recover the data and customers who had credit will not be able to use their credit. This is absolutely bullshit! This is not a way to win customers and keep them! The only employee who was aware of this credit was a young lady by the name of Leslie who has since resigned to go to college in Pennsylvania. Now I have nobody who can confirm my monetary credit and I'm just out the money! I have made several attempts via email, Facebook, their Web site, and phone calls asking for one of the top level managers, Ray, to call me and all of my requests have fallen on deaf ears. I will do my due diligence and public relations work to make this poor business practice well known throughout the Queen Creek, East Mesa, and Gilbert communities. I am totally disgusted by the management and employees of this location and I think this is my last meal here. Very sad because the food actually is pretty good."}
{"text":"I won't be ordering food from this establishment- I received a $5 coupon in the mail for the new scottsdale location which is close to my house so I called at 4pm to order chow me in for pick up/ Alex who answered the phone asked to place me on a brief hold, that hold turned into 7mjnutes where I could hear him and his conversation to other employees. I finally hung up and tried calling back 3x, no one answered. After the 4th call back and waiting another 3minutes to place my single order of chow mein after I told him my order was complete he says okay it will be ready in 40 minutes... 40 minutes for 1 item?!!! Little did he understand I was sitting in the parking lot and there was no one inside- smh"}
{"text":"I recently had the pleasure of dining at the restaurant on Power and just south of SR-202. Even though the summertime temperatures are flirting with the 110 degree mark, I felt the \"desire-for- fire\"   as my old College chums and I used to say, whenever we needed something spicy and flavorful, but was not Mexican food. As I passed through the door I was welcomed by one of the Staff and I  was asked caringly, \"How was your day?\" I was somewhat astonished, as I incorrectly thought that fast food restaurants of this caliber that have proliferated around the valley, do not actually care about their customers, and are just interested in \"moving the masses\" in and out of the store.  I looked at the menu and discovered a treasure trove of Thai delicacies. I ordered the Yellow curry at my favorite level of spiciness. There are 4 levels to choose from if I recall correctly. From a mild tongue tingle to all out \"blow-the-top of-your-head-off\" Hot! I chose a chicken meat filler as well, to round out the flavor of a medley of potatoes, carrots, various peppers and spices.  As I was ordering, the manager suggested I compliment my dish with twin \"spring rolls\". These hit the perfect gustatory \"Notes\" as their sweetness ,after being drenched in the Thai version of \"sweet & sour sauce\", immediately brought an involuntary smile on my face when I took the first bite. I complemented the meal with some brown rice and was upgraded (at no charge to me) to a side of noodles! They wanted me to see how I liked them. Needless to say, I will always add noodles to the meal on future visits.  But no meal is complete without something to slake your thirst. Especially after challenging your tongue with authentic spicy treats from Thailand. So I ordered a tall glass of Thai Tea. I personally don't think there is a single drink that can compete with the smooth \"woody\" flavor of authentic Thai Tea. Especially if it is brewed slowly, and sweetened with \"real cane sugar. Not \"sugar beet\" sugar - but sugar cane sugar! Mmm mmm mmm!   I spoke with the manger and was told that all the dishes are actual Thai dishes handed down from generations of recipes from the head chefs' family.  So, there is no \"assembly line meals\" you get from Thai Chili2Go. As the young people say: \"They're just keeping it real!\".   I would encourage everyone to visit this string of restaurants, as they have restaurants in various gathering places in the East Valley. The food is delicious, the staff is attentive and the ambiance is relaxing and gratifying.  Eat there; you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai place to go!!! Can't get enough. Love that they do not close in the middle of the day like a lot of Thai Restaurants. Have ordered online & over the phone and never been disappointed in my order, always fresh and ready for pick up. Large portions at a great value. My 2 favorites are Panang Curry Chicken and Chicken Pad Thai. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I was apprehensive about trying it because I thought \"Thai fast food can't be good\", I was wrong.  The first time we went we ordered in and the food took a couple minutes to come out and the cashier even brought it to our table - this place is like a mix between sit down and fast food. The food we got was HOT! I don't mean chili hot, I mean \"Timmy don't touch the stove while it's on\" hot. I wish I could tell you how my food tasted the first time but I burnt my taste buds off the first bite :/  The second time around I learned my lesson. We took it home and I waited until the food cooled off a bit before eating it. Taste is a 5/5!  It feels like the portions when you dine in are bigger than when you take out.  Check your mail for coupons!"}
{"text":"Had the Pad Thai with medium heat.  Added chicken, beef, and shrimp-- I was super hungry.  It was very good with lots of great flavor and not too spicy.  I didn't get veggies so the meat was really the star of the show!  Also shared Thai spring rolls, they were very tasty."}
{"text":"Great lunch with dumpling appetizer and noodle bowl with chicken and kicked up the spice.  Medium is perfect amount of spice.  This is new place and clean with very helpful employees.  They do Uber Eats too.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I want to thank both Thai Chili in Mesa and Chandler. I screwed up and ordered food from the Mesa location and paid online. Both stores were more than kind and helpful in transferring my order. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's wrong with the person who was complaining about it not being spicy but I didn't have that problem. I had a runny nose three bites in and I only got the medium spice. I seriously said \"dear lord baby Jesus\" out loud. It was spicy. It was a good lunch but be careful how spicy you want it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews. I've tried many thai places in the valley and I think Thai Chili is a great place if you are looking for good, fast, and inexpensive Thai flavors. The location is very clean, organized, and helpful."}
{"text":"Went to Thailand last year and took cooking classes there. Learned a lot about sour, savory, salty, and sweet. Became a big fan of Thai food. Problem is....there are very few places that make authentic Thai here in the States. But when I need my Thai food Fix, this place gave it to me. I love peppers and anything that is \"Thai Hot\". Thai Chili 2 Go understands \"Thai Hot\". Even if they didn't cook it hot enough, they had plenty of Thai Chili flakes to provide what I needed. Next time I'm in Mesa, I'll know where to get my Thai Food Fix!"}
{"text":"Double charged on my account after I explained to them that I'm only pay for one order and cancelled other.   Didn't take any action."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for Thai food on the go. The portions though looked a little smaller than their other stores.   I've been to two other Thai chili's and this is definitely the nicest looking one. It's inside a complex that looks brand new and it's a lot more spacious than the other ones as well.   The service is good here, nothing really special but the employees were kind.   The food was awesome except the portions looked smaller than normal. My wife got the curry panang with chicken. Pretty tasty except you're always left with more sauce than rice. We are definitely gonna ask for another order of rice next time we go. The rice to curry ratio that they give you otherwise would probably make a soup.   I also got pad siew which was really good, however it seemed my portion was a little small. Maybe it was just that one time, but I'll have to go again to confirm.   Either way, I'd still recommend this place if you're craving Thai food. They're noodles are definitely satisfying enough and their curry is definitely tasty enough to come back over and over again."}
{"text":"This place was alright. The taste was good, but the amount of chicken that is given for a $10+ dish is ridiculous they pile on the veggies and sauce but give you hardly any chicken. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch while shopping with 2 adults and a 5yr old. We ordered the cashew veggie with chicken, pad thai with shrimp, spring rolls and dumplings. The food was delivered to our table quickly. It was all light, fresh and delicious.  Staff was friendly and attentive. Restaurant (and restroom) were very clean as well. Even the 5yr old - initially upset that we weren't getting burger kid meals - gave it a smile and a thumbs up. . We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Really impressed.  The green curry tastes like a real Thai curry rather than the usual washed out stuff in many a USA Thai.  If looking for quick simple tasty bite then give it a visit."}
{"text":"Great service, clean restaurant and tasty food!! Definitely recommend it for anyone wanting quick Thai food. They also have $2 coupons for anyone who orders online."}
{"text":"I love this Thai food restaurant, their food is delicious all around, especially their Yellow Curry and their Tom Kha Gai. I recently visited and ordered food for my family, and they had it out to my table very quickly. When I ordered, I specified two dishes that needed to not be spicy at all in order to satisfy my grandmother who can't eat spicy food. Despite this, the food that came to my table was too spicy for my grandmother to eat. I brought it back, and Leslie, Valeria, and Hannah were very quick to address my concerns and helped resolve the problem quickly and with smiles on their faces. Overall I am very happy with the service they provided and can recommend eating here."}
{"text":"My son is picky-- but we thought the food was great! He got Drunken Noodles with Beef and now he wants to go back every night."}
{"text":"This place is solid.  I really like the simplistic concept and freshly made food.  Looking forward to trying it again and choosing some other entrees.  The garlic eggplant looked legit.    Son ordered pad siew with chicken, medium spicy. I ordered Pad Thai with chicken medium spicy.   The pad siew was very very good, wish there was more broccoli, it was very simple.  The pad Thai was just ok, a little too saucy and it just seemed to be missing a little kick of something, not sure what.   The fried dumplings were tasty and came with a thick dipping sauce.  Definitely recommend.  Ordered the $4 Strawberry drink...  not very good and I wouldn't recommend.  Thai Tea is premixed and extremely sweetened.  I love Thai tea but I wouldn't order it again from here."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Great place. Food is tasty and people are hospitable. I had the chicken panang. Will come again."}
{"text":"Food was great for take-out.  We ordered green curry, red curry,  spring rolls and fried rice with chicken.  We had it delivered and I was happy he found my apartment on his own.    We will be getting food from here again for sure!  ----- Update:  We've ordered for take out, delivery and even ate there once.  This is fantastic 'fast-food'.  Not the best Thai I've had but this is now one of our local favs after a long day of work."}
{"text":"Seriously such good food! Always hits the spot! I have never had a bad dish from here. I use the door dash app to order and it's been fantastic! My favorites are yellow curry, pad Thai, and the cashew veggie (you select your protein) sooooooooo good!!!!"}
{"text":"The yellow curry I ordered was flavorful, but the vegetables were extremely undercooked especially the potatoes. It was disappointing."}
{"text":"Don't let the title of the restaurant fool you.  The name would give you the expectation that they specialize in to-go orders and will get your food at a reasonably quick timeframe....nope.  I put in a to-go order via the app.  I received a reply on the app that the food would be ready in 20 minutes.  I received my food in 30 minutes and the restaurant onlly had 2 tables occupied.  Lastly, no apology for my food taking so long.  Didn't meet expectations.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I liked this place,  I have been getting take out a lot,  and an occasional eat in... The drivers know me, and the last quote from my driver was \"you addicted\"  then it happened, I tried to order 4 times, to no avail, people on phone didn't know what to do, and I have a standing order, I finally called back to get some voice mail saying I was in que but I wasn't, that happened twice, then I asked to speak to Alec the Manager,  they put me on hold, asking if I was his mother?????  then  I finally just asked for a manager,  long story short, Alec doesn't work there, and I haven't ordered in months. I have moved on to greener and better pastures.  too bad...  but I will save some money! Grub hub delivers sushi to my home on a hot summer night, all cold and wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great food but not a fan of how they serve rice in a Chinese take out box!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday  after having a crazy craving for thai and a bad Migraine.  The service was amazing and I really got full and satisfied quickly.  The beef phat thai and the dumplings were awesome and the noodles were perfect  for what I  was looking for. I noticed they were very sanitary about cleaning the tables down with fresh rags. Awesome stuff!"}
{"text":"Ordered the red curry with beef. It was very flavorful. Only thing was the beef was cooked to death and cut into large pieces so it was tough. I want to go back and try the pad Thai"}
{"text":"First time and I loooove it. Started with the dumplings which even when I got home were still crunchy and super tasty... the dipping sauce I could have drank. For entree had the chicken chow mein medium spice and it had a good amount of kick, the veggies were fresh and a good amount of chicken. You get a TON of noodles so next time I'll ask for less but either way it's a two meal entree for me."}
{"text":"I have to give credit & 5 stars to an amazing manager Gary and his restaurant. After a long day at work; I called in my order for pick up once I got home and started to have my chicken pad thai, it was to spicy I just couldn't eat it so I called and Gary immediately offered to have a new dish (mild) delivered to my home.... Within 45 minutes he delivered my dinner and included Thai Ice Cream to help with the spiciness, himself!! Great service, delicious food, but 100%grateful for the great experience. Thank you, Gary!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from Uber eats after checking the reviews on all the other Thai places available. This place had 4 stars and was a no brainer. The food arrived 30 mins later and WOW am I impressed! I would have thought the Uber driver cooked it in his car that's how fresh it was. I ordered the drunken noodles with chicken and they actually put tons of chicken not like other places that give a bunch of veggies. Very flavorful! Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Very flavorful food. Good to have such places around.  My suggestion is that that they should have lunch menu. Its a little pricey compared to the lunch menu at the other restaurants in the neighborhood. They will price themselves out of business."}
{"text":"Definitely fast food Thai.  Place is clean but the food as ok at best.  Clearly not using the best or freshest ingredients.  It was quick though and the prices were reasonable.  I would equate this to Panda Chinese."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! They do make it spicy so order on the lower side of spice if you are not a fan. The food did take a long time to make though as other people have said. Don't be in a rush when you come here."}
{"text":"Just opened and we were lucky enough to snag a half off Smart Shopper Deal today. I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai Mild. Next time I would go up a spice level as it was very mild, but just the right amount of sweet and tangy sauce.  My hubby had the Cashew Nut and Veggies. It was loaded with veggies in a broth sauce that was very flavorful. When you dine in you are served in actual dishes- a nice touch!  We loved this spot and will definitely be back!  Busy at lunch with many eat in and take out orders."}
{"text":"Lackluster.. tried their curry the first time and their soup the second time. Both is the fast food equivalent of thai food.. I might give it one more try with the pad thai."}
{"text":"Placed an in store order to go on Friday evening, had a special order of no egg in the Pad Siew.  I get home to discover eggs in it.  Double checked receipt, it says no eggs.  Not good! Girl working the register looked like she just rolled out of bed.  Hair all a mess and mumbling.  The rest of the staff I dealt with was very friendly.  This store just opened, hopefully this step it up.  This one is much closer to my house than the QC location."}
{"text":"Just tried Thai Chili 2 Go last night. Ordered the Panang Chicken and the Basil Beef. Wow! Was really impressed how good it was. Great value, too. We will definitely be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"The best thing to happen to Gilbert! Thai food that is made to order, incredible quality, inexpensive, this place is the best!!  If I eat out anywhere on this side of town, it is here. Started talking thai food with coworkers and found out that everyone else shares my opinion about this place.   THE BEST!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Totally recommend the Thai fried rice. The restaurant is clean and the employees are very friendly. I would totally come back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the shrimp fried rice, the shrimp was big and the taste was pretty sweet. My fiance got the pad prig pao, he order it hot said the flavor was good and he would get it again but with more spice next time. They checked on us and really seamed to care that we enjoyed the food. I will absolutely eat here again."}
{"text":"Good Thai food with some uniqueness.  This location is consistently good service.  Make sure you call in your order early.  It can be a long wait."}
{"text":"I lucked out and got an uber eats from them on their first day open. Right out of the gate, delicious. I'm back for more."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery last night and were pleasantly surprised. The delivery was quick, the yellow curry was flavorful, the drunken noodles were nice and garlicky; the chicken was tender for both dishes. We will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!!   I had Spicy Eggplant w brown rice, hubby had Drunken Chicken Noodle and he loved it. Generous portion too"}
{"text":"Great food but takes FOREVER to get it. Thought it was popularity but barely anyone here and it took 30 minutes to get two meals. Other than food preparation I happy with everything else."}
{"text":"First time here at this newly opened Thai Chili 2 Go Restaurant.  Familiar concept popping up this time Thai theme with a selection of curry, soup or rice and noodles.  Then choose a protein and then the level of how hot you want it.  Ordered the Yellow Curry with Chicken with White Rice Mild and the Panang Curry with Chicken with White Rice both at Mild level.  Everything was pretty good, yellow curry had bell peppers, potatoes and chicken with the white rice in a separate take out container so I just mixed it together.  The Panang was a peanut taste and a little on the sweet side but also tasty.  Would definitely come back to try the noodles or soup, good start Thai Chili 2 Go!"}
{"text":"Not too bad but not the best Thai food I have had. I will go there because of their prices because they are a little cheaper and also the free delivery. If I am looking for more quality Thai food I would probably go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I went to the one in Chandler and it was great, wanted to try this one and got disappointed. The food was ok but the customer service was terrible. I couldn't ask anything without them making a face. All I wanted was the food and get the hell out of there. I got a pad thai with tofu, hot, and it didn't burn my mouth. I tried Thai hot once and it was more like a 8/10 so either way I think that if you want extra Thai Hot you should ask because YMMV on the spice level depending on which location you are going. Otherwise, good concept, a biet on the pricy side comparing to similar shops."}
{"text":"Service sucks the order line was closed a girl just standing there guy in front of me taking forever we are standing in the pick up order line cause the order line was closed so the girl standing there opens the order line and asks if there is anyone here to pick up an order I wasn't so I didn't say anything then it's my turn to order an I'm in the pick up order line so he asks me if I am here to pick up and order an I said no she just asked that from the Oder line so where do I order then I asked! They linked baffled so I walked out! The stupidest people working in a store that has decent food! Next"}
{"text":"We got a coupon in the mail so we went to give it a try. The service was very good--when we ordered a vegetarian/vegan dish, the cashier asked whether we are vegan then kindly informed us the dish is not vegan because there is fish sauce/oyster sauce in it. We appreciate the thoughtfulness. Also, although most people would order take outs, the \"manager\" walked around to check on the customers who chose to dine in.   The food was standard takeout food. It was fresh and tasty. We will definitely go back."}
