{"text":"Dinner on Sunday night was a disaster.  
The  butter plates on our table were dirty. (yuck) 
Both of the Moroccan lamb ravioli dishes arrived cold, twice!  

The lid on the coffee pot fell off and the waitress poured coffee on the table and on my husband's jacket.  No apologies,
A bus boy dropped a huge tray of dirty dishes next to our table.   

I would describe our dining experience as surreal.
Doubt we'll ever return certainly not for dinner.  
IMO management needs to better train the entire kitchen and dining room staff,  

(The price of one of the ravioli dishes was taken off our bill,)"}
{"text":"Sonoma Grille is one of the better spots that I've dined at in Pittsburgh. I should start by saying that I have dined here about 5 times, but only at dinner. Overall, I really like the place, but there are a few refinements that they could take on that would make the place a little better. Overall, the atmosphere and service are pretty good. The atmosphere isn't on the casual side, but not too stuffy either. I have experienced the occasionally inconsistent service experience, though. I loved Emily, at the bar--great attitude and excellent service. 

The restaurant offers an extensive wine list, with many by the glass, but their markup seemed little higher that many places. They also have a small selection (about 5) of microbrews on draft (with other selections in the bottle) that are appealing--not extensive in that regard, but enough to keep a craft beer drinker from going thirsty. 

Overall, I'd say the food is pretty good. Certainly a cut above, but not top of the line. One of the things that the restaurant boasts is that it uses local and sustainable growers and suppliers for its ingredients. A definite plus in my book. In everything that I have had here, the ingredients were definitely fresh and flavorful. 

I have had a few different items here and they have all been pretty good. My first time in I had the filet mignon, which was very good--mashed potatoes were great with that as well. I have also had the chicken and the salmon here, and all were pretty good. My one complaint about the food would be that they tend to overcook the meats a little--med-rare steak comes out more like medium; well-done does not need to mean cooked dry; that sort of thing. The service staff and management always strove to make it right, though, which is something you don't always find anymore. I have also had the stirfried vegetables on their mixed grill plate several times and they have always come out great--not too firm or too soft with great fresh flavor. 

Despite its few inconsistancies, overall Sonoma Grille offers a pretty solid dining experience. I definitely recommend a pop-in if you are travelling through Pittsburgh and are looking for a a pretty good bite paired with a great wine."}
{"text":"Great wine list and a good twist on traditional dishes. Recommended!"}
{"text":"This place overreaches. The Sonoma burger was ridiculous. All show. Uninteresting to eat.  Tres pretentious."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a most enjoyable dinner at Sonoma Grill before the theatre, beginning with an upbeat friendly greeting. The room was subtley lighted helping us relax into a new atmosphere after fighting the cold outside.  The wines we selected, with a suggestion by our knowledgable waiter were perfect for our menu sections and the appetizer \"nudie\" freely offered was a taste treat. The short walk to the theatre and parking was the perfect way to help digest an excellent dinner. We will return again!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant that came highly recommended to myself and my date. Romantic setting that is also good for larger groups. The waitstaff was helpful and extremely knowledgeable regarding the menu and wine list, and gave us great advice as to how we should tackle such a diverse and interesting menu. 

If you are in the 412, certainly stop here for dinner. The avocado and crab meat tian was to die for, and order the duck as your main entree- you won't believe your tastebuds. Also, who knew chocolate creme brûlée existed? It does at Sonoma. And you don't want to leave without tasting it."}
{"text":"After sitting down, the waitress arrived at our table, and stated that she will take our order even though she is not going to be our waitress, as we ordered she appeared annoyed, and her response as I ordered was less than professional, I did not get her name.

In addition, there was only four more people in the restaurant and our food took 37 minutes to arrive. 

The waiter that was working the table next to us helped deliver the food with the waitress, after that she disappeared the waiter finished taking care of us, he was very professional with excellent people skills."}
{"text":"The service was terrible, waiters reaching over you, cleaning the table when people were still eating, almost like they wanted you out (it was 11 pm).  The cock au vin was sent back, dried chicken with the sauce salty uneatable taste. The other three dishes were o.k., but nothing to write home about.
I doubt that we will return here, although in the past we came many times. It has deteriorated a lot."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant five stars. Our food was excellent. I am a vegan and my coworker is on a paleo diet. The executive chef and manager greeted us at the hostess desk. He was very nice and offered to make my meal personally.  I gave him free reign to make anything and he did not disappoint.  

When we were seated, we eventually got a waitress. She seemed pleasant and gave me a great wine recommendation.  She took our appetizer orders and my coworker's paleo entrée order. It took longer than expected for our appetizers but nothing to cry about. The issue is that our waitress didn't acknowledge us after she brought my wine. She didn't ask if I liked the wine. She didn't come clearance appetizer plates or rake the menus.  She didn't ask anyone else to look in on us. We were in the restaurant for over an hour before our entrees came out. Though our waitress walked by our table numerous times as we waited, at no point did she acknowledge the delay or give us some insight into the delay. We just sat twittling our thumbs. When my coworker got his meal he was missing one if the two proteins. Thankfully one-of-a-kind the food runners was around and she immediately went into the kitchen and got him his bronzino. The service killed what could have been a great experience."}
{"text":"Love this place! My fiance and I went before a show at the Byham Theater nearby. The evening was our Christmas gift to each other, so we went all out. Our food was great and our waiters made an excellent wine suggestion. Definitely not cheap, but will assuredly be the place we go for our next special event."}
{"text":"We were passing through Pittsburgh and  made reservations here based on reviews. We weren't disappointed. We couldn't decide on a bunch of apps or an entree. Server told us to have an app and take our time. Ended up with a couple of apps, shrimp and gnudi, and split the salmon, which was really fresh and delicious. The staff couldn't have been nicer, from the hostess, server, manager. If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, I would go back."}
{"text":"This was the first time to visit Sonoma Grille and my experience was absolutely amazing. My wife and I had Chef's Tapas for two for our entree and it was great. I had Ribeye steak which came with a huge bone marrow. I asked a waiter to cook it medium rare because I've had overlooked steaks when ordered 'medium' at other restaurants. It was absolutely tender and juicy. A bit too salty, though. In general, I thought meals here are bit salty for me. However, I liked it!"}
{"text":"Ugh. Walked in without a reservation, so we excepted a slight wait, but were made to lounge around for 20+ minutes when there were clearly at least a dozen open tables. The wait almost seemed punitive (a feeling encouraged by the eye-rolling hostess). Tan, dated look inside - reminiscent of a 90s Olive Garden (without the slight faux-Italy charm) - and kind, but frankly slow service. Had the Indonesian duck, which we were told was the star of the menu. Some star. Ample duck but uninspired flavor. Sides seemed like an afterthought. The connection to California was a bit of a charade."}
{"text":"This is going to be my first time to write a restaurant review. I had dinner there last night with my friends it was a birthday party. We made reservation at 7pm and we were sat around 7:30pm.I can say this is the most horrible experienced  dining I ever had. As soon as we sat down we order drinks it took forever to come out and some drinks our waitress forgot. We ordered the food one of my friend ordered the apetizer but it came out with her meal. We waited for so long for the food to come out we were really starving and honestly it's not worth to wait for what you are paying. Service was horrible she have no idea what she was doing when the check came she charged us 4 sangria that we didn't get!!! It honestly ruin our plan for that night because we had to spend literally 3 and half hours waiting for the service that it was awful slow. I WILL NEVER EVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AND I WILL TELL TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW TO BEWARE OF THIS RESTAURANT!!!!HORRIBLE SERVICE, FOOD WASN'T GOOD AT ALL I WISH I CAN GIVE ZERO STAR!"}
{"text":"Sonoma grill is a very nice restaurant very good service my server treated me like a queen will definitely go back there and bring family and friends"}
{"text":"We dined here in April 2014 and had a very nice experience. I'm a bit surprised to see some recent poor reviews regarding the service, our servers Michael and Bonnie were great: attentive, personable and professional.

I started with Vegetarian French Onion Soup. If you like coriander, you're going to love it. I wasn't a fan for that reason, it tasted  pretty funky to me. The main course I chose  was the Crispy Indonesian Glazed Duck. One bite and the soup was forgotten - it was fantastic! Crispy on the outside as advertised, melt in your mouth deliciousness on the inside. Perfect flavor,  and accompanied by stir fried vegetables and sticky rice. For dessert I always choose crème brûlée when it is offered and theirs didn't disappoint, it was very creamy and not grainy, caramelized nicely to finish.

I'm not a wine snob but I felt the wine was a bit pricey. The other drinks were priced as expected for downtown Pittsburgh.

Overall, very good and we will return."}
{"text":"We stayed in pittsburgh over Easter weekend and ended up having two meals here because the food and atmosphere were great. Chef tries to incorporate a farm to table California feel into the menu which makes the dishes fresh and interesting. They also have a good selection of wine. It was nice to be able to sit outside because the street was quiet."}
{"text":"Awesome meal any foodie would love. Especially enjoyed the seafood bisque   Wonderful service. We had very charming, knowledgable and entertaining wait staff."}
{"text":"So I usually never post negative reviews on yelp but I am pretty upset about my experience at Sonoma Grille. I booked a dinner reservation for 10 girls for my friends Bachelorette Party back in April. Keep in mind the reservation was made in February (over two months in advance). 

Since it was a special occasion I was contacted by their Event Planning & Sales Coordinator. We were promised a great experience and it wasn't impressive to say the least. When we arrived for dinner they lost our reservation. We had to wait 25 minutes until they could figure out where to put us - since the restaurant was full they basically pushed a few tables together in front to accommodate us which ended up being fine. The Manager was very apologetic and comped us two bottles of champagne which was nice. He kept apologizing and saying we were going to have the best night ever and they were going to make it up to us.... That's when things went down hill. 

We ordered a couple bottles of wine which we had to wait over 20 minutes for. When the appetizers came it was another 45 minutes until we received our entrees. The service was so slow. I understand that our server received another 10 top that he wasn't expecting; however, they certainly weren't \"making it up\" to us as promised. The food was tasty - that was probably the only positive thing about the experience. Dishes piled up in front of us - they were not cleared in between the appetizers and dinner. For as much as we spent there I definitely expected better service. I definitely will not be going back. 

I wouldn't have written this review if Sonoma would have gotten back to me after I had sent an e-mail following our experience. I can't believe that my e-mail was never returned. Just overall poor customer service."}
{"text":"We came here for Valentine's Day. The service was so nice and the environment was so romantic"}
{"text":"Traveled to Pittsburgh with a group for a conference.  On Wednesday afternoon, we ended up with a group of 8 looking for a place for dinner.  Sonoma Grille was able to accommodate our needs with a 7:30 pm reservation.  I had actually eaten there on a previous trip and enjoyed it so I had an idea of what to expect.

The restaurant is nice and fairly large.  They have an inviting bar/lounge area that opens to the street.

The menu is somewhat limited as far as main courses, but they have plentiful tapas, appetizers and other small plates.  The wine list is extensive and they have a (very) full bar.

The service was attentive and the food was very good.  Prices are reasonable for a downtown restaurant.  All in, we were around $75 per person for dinner and drinks.  My only qualm is that when we ordered, they were out of New York Steak (which is the only steak on the menu).  I substituted the pork chop, but running out of a staple like steak at 7:30 seemed odd to me.

Nonetheless, the food, drink, service and overall experience rates 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"Our first time there, we were looking for a relaxing dinner before the symphony. The service was excellent, the waitstaff knowledgeable and the food delicious. Next time I will order less! The fish chowder was as good as a chowder I got earlier this fall in a Maine restaurant. tI would have been enough in itself. The mixed grill with filet and salmon on a bed of grilled vegetables was excellent. Next time, I will order only one - probably the filet. I have not ordered beef in years - and this was a good reminder of how good it can be! Oh yes, there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"Company Christmas Party. 

Had a Clementini first which was average. Wine rookie so I asked the staff for suggestions. All wines suggested by staff were very good, although I wish they would of given me a brief description of what I was getting. 

Got to try a few varieties of their tapas. The flat bread, pulled pork, crab cakes, and the cucumber-wasabi filet were all amazing.

Atmosphere in banquet room was adequate. Dining room and bar seemed much nicer.  

Not sure if I would seek out Sonoma Grill again against other competition in the area, at least for now."}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us had a very nice dinner here.  The menu is interesting and inventive.  Wines are mostly from California and are very good.

Our server was very thorough in explaining the quirks in the menu selections, and were I in Pittsburgh again, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch since I was staying next door.  The menu looked good, so I gave it a shot and was seated at a table.  First impressions are funny though, and I sat there for about 15min before anyone even approached me... It was a quiet late afternoon, and there were staff walking around to other tables several times.  Finally a server came around and took my order: I grabbed the Sonoma salad and the crab bisque.  The bisque was great! The salad was unimpressive: the vinaigrette was bland. This spot isn't terrible, but there are much better places around for lunch."}
{"text":"We came before a play for dinner and were in a bit of a rush. They sat us right away and the whole staff was very friendly. Our server, Sid, was accommodating to us being in a hurry and very knowledgable about the menu. 

The food was amazing. I had their onion cheese pasta dish and it was superb. My friends shared the duck and it was wonderful as were their salads. 

This place is perfect for a casual dinner or fancy dinning, although it is appropriately pricey."}
{"text":"We were visiting Pittsburgh from out of town and this was close to our hotel. The service was wonderful- our waitress was amazing! She gave us great suggestions with wine pairings. For an appetizer we got Scratch Gnudi-- SO YUMMY! I had the filet and my husband had the duck. Both were superb! Everything was fresh and made to perfection!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Sonoma Grill many times.  I used to eat there regularly when it first opened and I continued that program for several years.  It has been a couple years since my last visit and I expected things to slide downhill a little (which I find typical).

I was delighted with the meal I had last weekend.  It was awesome.  The food, wine and service were all excellent.  

We started with the AVOCADO AND CRABMEAT TIAN and the  LOCAL CIDER BRAISED PORK BELLY which were both delicious.  I really like their appetizer sampler platter which is presented on this big curved wooden sled.  I skipped it this time because the crabmeat tian is so good that I would include it on the must have list.

I was a little hesitant to order the CRISPY INDONESIAN GLAZED DUCK as my entree because I had a disappointing duck experience at Paris 66 a few weeks before (I keep trying different things at Paris 66 & I am consistently disappointed).  I tried it anyway it it was delicious.  It was tender and juicy with a crispy crust just as I would have envisioned the perfect duck entree to be.  My wife had the PAN SEARED DIVER SCALLOPS and they were seared with just a touch of crispy on the edges and nice and succulent on the inside....perfect!

We had a California Zinfandel which was very tasty and reasonably priced.  I can't remember the name of it...EMU or UMI or something like that.  

We spoiled ourselves with sorbet and the Apple Neapolitan for desert.  There was nothing about the meal that was not perfect.  There was only one questionable thing.  It was that the mayor came in with his entourage and we were concerned that the merriment that he was sharing with his crew was somehow coming out of our pockets.  He's allowed to enjoy himself - as long as it's not going on the city tab."}
{"text":"Looked good but mediocre.  Food was average.  Glad we didn't spend on a tasting menu for the cost. However the service was not top notch.  A bit slow, but more it was not polished.  Bread just plunked on table.  Dirty dishes not removed before next course."}
{"text":"I heard Sonoma Grille had very good food BUT I WOULDN'T KNOW.  My husband and I made reservations for 8pm this past Saturday.  We arrived at 7:50 and told the hostess we had reservations.  I turned to talk to my husband and realized 30 sec later that she didn't take our name.  I turned to tell her and she re-greeted me as if she didn't remember me.  The experience started off bad.  We were told to have a seat at the bar bc it would be a few minutes for our table.  There were 12-14 people at the bar and 3 bartenders who seemed completely overwhelmed. We were greeted after 11min.  My husband ordered his drink and I went to order mine and the bartender walked away.  After being at the bar for 23 min I was finally able to get a glass of wine.  We were seated at 8:50 (reservation at 8pm).  Not sure why I even made the reservation.  So after being here for an hr we were extremely hungry.  My husbands first pick was the lamb-OUT.  His second pick the veal- OUT.  They had duck which grabbed my eye- ummm, OUT.  How do you run an establishment like this.  The managers should be embarrassed.  We ended up leaving after being there for over an hr.  We went to grab a quick bite somewhere else bc he had a show to get to.  Completely unacceptable experience from all ends of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Unlike other newer, trendier restaurants on the other side of Penn Ave. (e.g., Salt of the Earth), Sonoma Grill focuses on: food & people first, and getting into your wallet later.

That is to say, it  is not cheap - but it is worth it.  We have eaten here twice, and it has been consistently good, with a few excellent surprises.  Moreover, we have been TREATED well, and unlike the cocksure chef at SOTE, who thinks he knows better than you, the chef here comes out to discuss his experiments, get feedback, and then revise based on what the CUSTOMERS think.

Finally, you actually get some food on the plate, so you won't pay $100 to leave hungry.  You will, however, probably pay $100--especially if you get an app and a couple of drinks.  BUT--you will also get: bread; often an amuse-bouche for free; and when we were there, we debated and then decided against a dish with a pork belly side... the waiter hearing this brought over a little pork belly to taste for us for free!

And the food is between good and great--and consistent.  The atmosphere is upbeat and friendly.  

This is our favorite 'spend a little more restaurant' in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Not sure what's up with the decor though. It's very 1998 Olive Garden. Really strange. Definitely not fitting for the quality of the meal."}
{"text":"*****Inventive American cuisine, with large selection of American wine. **** Any selection from their mixed grill will not disappoint, including their surprising Indonesian Tofu. For the carnivore, the venison is very well hung. For the vegetarian, the Braised Endive is pleasantly delicate."}
{"text":"Came here after a long day of sightseeing because of convenience, as it's connected to the neighboring Courtyard Marriot.

The ambiance was nice, albeit a little more formal than it warrants.

The food was good. We were led to believe they had a viable tapas selection, but they did not. They did have a sort of \"mix and match\" main plate, but true tapas it is not. Good flavors, interesting preparation. Though all of the protein was overlooked (steak, chicken, salmon). Given the price, it was disappointing.

Solid meal, decent service, just nothing special."}
{"text":"i really like the feel of this place. The staff was very customer focused and  even hand-stuffed the olives with blue cheese for my martini.  the tapas were all great and i loved the short rib. Scallops were good, just wished the portions were large.

definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"It's a dead restaurant, unenthusiastic staff and unimpressive food. I am a foodie so I have eaten here multiple times just to give them a chance to come up with something better but NO. It's a nice place but if you want good food and service then you might wanna skip this for this price point."}
{"text":"great food, great service. Really like this place and their menu is unique and delicious. Have been back several times. Great place for a date or to meet friends or to celebrate a special occassion."}
{"text":"Aside from enjoyable lunch and brunch experiences, I'm mainly leaving this review in reference to a rental experience. My friends and I hosted a bridal shower for a friend at Sonoma Grille for approximately 40 guests. I was a little concerned since our group was too large for the private room and we had to just reserve the back half of the restaurant. I shouldn't have worried, because everything looked lovely and it felt very private. The food was excellent, and the service was exceptional. All of the staff were friendly, professional, and went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect. I also felt that the prices were quite reasonable. The event coordinator I worked with via email and telephone prior to the shower was also wonderful. I took for granted how detail oriented and accommodating she was until I hosted another shower at a different PGH restaurant a few months later. If you are looking to host a rehearsal dinner, shower, etc, I would definitely recommend Sonoma Grille."}
{"text":"Surprisingly  good food.  Not a lot of choices downtown, but this restaurant is a very good bet.  The shrimp tempura was very juicy and large with a light batter and wonderful sauce.  The salads were really ample,  filled with interesting ingredients and served with tasty dressings.  Sauteed veggies were also fresh, crispy and well prepared.  Service was very attentive and professional."}
{"text":"Four of us went here before Jerry Seinfeld. I expected it to be amazing. I was disappointed. Brady had the steak. I have grilled better steak myself. Nothing was terrible .... but nothing was exceptional. The service was good though!"}
{"text":"Great evening at Sonoma Grille last night. It was crowded before the evening's plays but they fit us in without a reservation. We had a Tapas dinner with many excellent options, and shared a crispy duck entree. Service was fantastic. Our waiter (and even the busboy!) were very well informed about the menu and guided us to a great set of appetizers and a wonderfully paired wine.  Total bill was expensive, largely driven by a splurge on the wine, but not unreasonable for the quality of food, ambiance, and service. Would definitely recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the waitstaff needs some training.

Party of four-- 2 women and 2 men, went there for brunch around 1:00 yesterday.  I would guess there were only about 15 tables that had patrons seated at them throughout the restaurant (both inside and outside).  

We were seated outside, half of our party able to sit out of direct sunlight under the awning while the other half of us figured we'd just tolerate the sun.  More on this in a minute.

The hostess handed us menus and started talking about how she might be our server or it might be someone else.  She repeated it a few times, which was a little strange to me.  This is supposed to be upscale dining, right?  As a customer, I don't think I should be made privy to any processes or issues pertaining to which server's turn it is to take a table.  Hand me my menu and whenever the staff figures it out, whoever can come introduce him or herself as our server.  I can almost guarantee no customer is going to reply to a hostess serving them with:  \"What?  You seated us!  You can't POSSIBLY be our server too!  This is an outrage!  Let's leave right now!\"

Our server was a little weird.  At first I thought maybe she was on drugs-- she was friendly enough and smiled, but she had no enthusiasm and moved and spoke really slowly.  Maybe it's her first serving job and she was really nervous, I don't know.

When drinks were ordered, I ordered last and said: \"I'm so thirsty, could I please have some water with ice?\" and she started telling me about their water filtration system and how it chilled the water and if she gave me ice it would be REALLY cold, would that be okay?  Perhaps that's part of her job to make sure as a customer I understand that ice will make water colder (!!!), but it was really awkward and I had JUST said I'm very thirsty and was sitting in direct sunlight.  I realize a glass of water is the last thing a server wants to bring a guest, but come on, if you're making it difficult for me to order a glass of ice water on a hot summer day, you need to examine your customer service skills.

The food RUNNER was excellent.  She served the ladies first (sorry, I'm a bit old school in my dining habits) and offered to open the awning further so the entirety of our party was in the shade.  The food runner did this.  So, back to our seating experience-- as we were being seated and trying to scooch the table out of the sun under the awning (without disturbing other patrons) and the HOSTESS was seating us, it never occurred to the hostess to open the awning further to make us more comfortable?  (By the way, it's a motorized awning, all the food runner did was push a button.)  

I had the tofu scramble.  It was wonderful.  The potatoes were a little spicy for my liking, but I'm a wuss when it comes to spiciness.  My fellow diners ordered the crab cakes, the burger, and one of the Father's Day brunch specials, which I believe was turkey.  Everyone at the table was pleased with their food.

And not to my surprise, our server didn't check back on us until 2 out of the 4 of us were done with our food, and then we waited a long time to get our bill, and waited a long time for her to come pick up the payment.

So, again, to sum up:  Good food, but for an upscale establishment, the wait staff falls short."}
{"text":"Sonoma is totally forgettable. There was nothing wrong with the place, except for maybe the overly effected service (the waiter who responds to \"thank you\" with \"thank you\" instead of \"your welcome\"). If someone who loved this restaurant wanted to take me back I'd go, but I won't go there by choice again."}
{"text":"Service was too slow. Waited half hour for wine to be served (really you just pick the bottle and pour it in glass ), 45 mins for bread to arrive , and over an hour for entree. The wait would have been ok if the food was great.  Ordered tapas for 2 and grilled beef kabob and salmon with stir fry vegetables . Not good at all! Grill portions are small and not well seasoned. Vegetables are drenched in oil and soy sauce :/ .  Really not worth the money and time spent."}
{"text":"I love the food and the concept (man that sounds so pretentious).  They really work to find local buyers, make sustainable AND work with Pittsburgh Grows.  
I have had been there twice and had outstanding meals. Randing from mixed grills, flat breads, beet salads, delightful seared tuna and yummy desserts (Lemon Cheesecake w/Earl Gray Meringue!).   The staff is friendly and well informed.  
Random perk: One of the lovely wait staff members helped us out with a helpful hint...We had to get to the theater and it was a monsoon outside.  Our waiter informed us that there \"might\" be some left over umbrellas in the stand by the door.  (He did tell us which ones had been left for several months so we didn't steal another patrons!)"}
{"text":"I've gone to Sonoma twice just to sit and have a glass or two of wine. The service both times has been excellent (once I was at a small table, the other time I was at the bar). Both times the bartenders/servers could talk extensively about the wine list, make recommendations, and didn't have a problem letting me sample several things until I found something that I liked. Thus far I've only had white wine here. I need to go back to sample the reds. Also, for a wine bar, I think that the prices per glass/bottle are pretty reasonable. I can't comment on the food as I have only had a fried cheese appetizer (kind of bland, but in a cornflake crust with really good plum sauce), and a bread basket (with awesome honey-butter). You know...to soak up the wine."}
{"text":"Arrived at the restaurant around 7:00 PM on a Saturday night. We were a party of 11 in town for a business meeting on a weekend when the Steelers and Notre Dame were in town. We didn't have a reservation and the restaurant was crowded but after a short wait, we were seated in a separate room at a long table. Entrees and appetizers were reasonably priced. Several enjoyed the French onion soup and mixed grill choices which came in 3 portion sizes. Nice selection of beer and wine. Staff was professional and very accommodating. Great experience."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends expecting a great evening out. I was very disappointed. I got the filet which was good but not excellent. We had an appetizer and we each had a salad or soup. Our entrees were followed by a desert. None of which we were impressed by. The services was extremely disappointing. We waited a very long time for our drinks. Then we asked the waiter to let us finish our first drink before we ordered. He kept returning and asking if we wanted to order. To which we replied \"no, we would like to finish our drink\". After the 5th time we finally felt pressured to order. When the meal came to a close the waiter brought the check and stood and waited for us to pay while we were finishing our drinks. I then asked if we were holding him up. To which he he replied no. Yet he continued to stand there. After about 5-7 minutes of him standing at our table we were so uncomfortable we decided to just pay the check so he would leave. Needless to say we felt very awkward and will never return."}
{"text":"We ate here last night and I was SO impressed.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but everything from our bottle of wine to our entrees was amazing.  We started with the croquettes for our appetizer and they were delicious.  I got the Study of Hog which is pork served three different ways and I couldn't pick a favorite they were all so good.  My boyfriend got the scallops with salmon pierogies which were also great.  Our server, James was so personable and made the experience even better.  We told him we were celebrating a belated valentines day and gave us our appetizer on the house! We will definitely return here."}
{"text":"My husband and I weren't ready to go home after dinner so we stopped in Sonoma Grille for a drink. We sat at the bar and the services was great! The guys behind the bar were so friendly, helpful, social and fun! The only reason I didnt give a 5 star review was b/c we didnt eat any food. I will certainly return just for the exceptional service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. I have dined here many times. The food is always delicious and creative. Excellent wine selection.  They do offer a personal five course meal, you just tell who is waiting on you what you like and don't like and they will creatively prepare dishes just for you with or without wine paired with each dish. Very cool and makes the experience more personal and unique."}
{"text":"Again, had dinner before heading to one of the musical events at Heinz Hall.  

Our waiter and supporting staff were very professional and helpful.  They guided my party to choose a great set of dishes.

We had the wine flights that my wife and I had instead of a bottle was a great choice.  The duck, study of pork and tenderloin kabobs were great.

Sonoma is my preferred go-to establishment in the golden triangle."}
{"text":"This was the second time this evening that my husband and I have visited to have a drink at the bar.  Though we would give it another try after the first negative experience thinking it was an individual bartender issue.  Both times, with different bartenders, we felt ignored when we first sat at the bar and with any follow up after the first drink.  No sense of urgency or customer service - essentially felt ignored and didn't care if we gave them any business or not. Didn't ask is we wanted menus. Minimal interaction and basically apathetic.  More interested in other staff than the customers. We had one drink then went over to Mercato- much better experience - as soon as we sat we were greeted and acknowledged and within a reasonable timeframe waited on and served and also checked on - like most bars do when they want customers to return and stay.  We won't be back to Sonoma. They need better training on customer service!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.  A bit noisy, but the food is always good and the service is friendly.  Really good wine list.  Convenient for business dinners.  Could be cleaner."}
{"text":"On a recent business trip to the area, we decided to check this place out - as did about half of the other convention attendees.

After waiting an hour to be seated, we were promptly informed that they were out of bread and three entrees.  I realize that they were slammed from the convention center but, considering they're a block from the convention center, you'd think they'd research events and be a bit more  prepared. 

It pretty much went down hill from there.  The drinks were bad and the food was mediocre.

I will say that the service was great as was the ambiance of the restaurant, though neither was enough to compensate for everything else."}
{"text":"I spent most of my day at the hair salon (worth it :)) so I stopped in for some grub. Well I'm guessing my timing was off because lunch service was done so I was presented with this very basic tapas menu.... At this point I just need booze and food asap!!! I ordered the buffalo hen and the flatbread of the day. Ok it should've been a sign when my waitress Amanda couldn't recall what's on it. At this point I don't care so I wait.... What I ended up with was a flat bread that was to hard coated with buffalo dip of some sort topped with peppers and prosciutto that was so hard it was like jerky ! So I couldn't eat that I told my waitress and she immediately took it off my bill . This place was such a disappointment so not worth the time or money"}
{"text":"As far as a wine list is concerned, Sonoma has one of the BEST in the city.  Indisputable.  

In my opinion the food is equally exceptional. To the extent possible the food is local and organic.  Quality and presentation are exceptional. The fare is certainly for a slightly sophisticated taste but not too uppity to be annoying for regular  folk.  

Al fresco brunch on a sunny day may be one of my favorite experiences."}
{"text":"I have traveled the country for the last 10 years for business and often ask for coworker recommendations for restaurants. Sonoma Grille was highly recommended, so we were happy to try it out! The food was impeccable; delicious fare, perfectly paired. 

We started our evening with a bottle of sparkling wine for the table (4 ladies).  We had planned on switching to wine, but decided to stay with the sparkling wine. Even though they didn't have our requested bottle (Valentines Day cleared them out), they brought a comparable bottle. When we requested a second bottle, they thought bringing out Andre as an equivalent would suffice. Absolutely not. 

The overall experience was nice, but I can't get past them offering Andre. It was insulting, to say the least. We did not order a 2nd bottle. Or dessert. We went elsewhere for that."}
{"text":"We're back with our daughter who is competing in the INTEL ISEF Science Fair. We first ate here three years ago when our son competed.

It's our first day back and our first meal stop is the Sonoma Grill. We ate between lunch and dinner time when they were serving from their bar snacks menu. The food is as memorable as ever and we look forward to having a full dinner here to enjoy their entire menu."}
{"text":"The Coq Au Vin was really well made. Tasty and fresh. The olives were grilled and I could have done without them, I like a nice crisp, cold, marinated olive. But everything else was tasty and satisfying, even the mocktail the bartender whipped up."}
{"text":"After a long day of meetings we stopped here to catch up on email and have a snack (which turned into dinner). Food was good, some unique items in the menu which was nice. But the standout was the service! Everyone we encountered was friendly and willing to go the extra mile! They turned an outside outlet in so we could charge our computers, made a fabulous mocktail for a pregnant friend and quickly adjusted our order after we ordered the wrong thing (wanted fries, ordered fries with mussels which we did not want). Lovely patio to enjoy the cultural district and nice wine selection with lots of by the glass options. Great spot!"}
{"text":"We had a really nice time at the Sonoma Grille tonight.   The atmosphere was great even sitting at the bar.   Service was very attentive and the food was great!   I will definately return and would recommend it as a special occasion place (Pittsburgh prices tend to be lower thean here.)  That said....I wasn't  offended by $90. for 2 no tincluding tax tip and drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped here prior to the theater.  Ordered several different small plates and everything was good!  Grilled olives, smoked trout, blue cheese. The crab avocado was just o.k. The best was the dessert-the Chocolate creme brulee was excellent!"}
{"text":"I love the western, California feel of this place.  It's casual but classy at the same time.  The atmosphere is cool, modern, and relaxing.  This place is perfect for a romantic or intimate get together with the significant other.  The food is fantastic seeing as it was inspired by renowned Chef Yves Carreau.  If it isn't the atmosphere, or the taste of the cuisine...the presentation of the dishes will be sure to get you.  They are more like little pieces of art rather than just plates of food.  And the best part is...their extensive wine selection will be sure to compliment any dish you choose to enjoy.  Fantastic, exotic deserts make an excellent end to an excellent meal.  Check it out.  Trust me."}
{"text":"The Restaurant is interesting calling itself a California Style Wine Bistro.  Our Server was excellent in attention, speed and knowledge of the food, etc.  

I ordered the Fisherman's Wharf Chowder (without the bread bowl) and received a large bowl of chowder that was very filling but had too much salt flavor.  I also had the Local Corned Beef Reuben Sandwich that seemed to be made of sliced roast beef and not corned beef, far from tasty to me.  I chose French Fries over the side of fresh fruit, which was a mistake.  They were seasoned but tasted like Salty fries only.  Another diner had the French Onion Soup which was reported as very good.

An interesting fact is that the restaurant does not have salt and pepper shakers on the tables.  Based on the taste of the food I had I'd say the chef does diners a great favor, since so many people add salt before tasting their dish.  The chef does not spare salt from what I could tell.

There were 20 of us dining here for lunch and most reported dissatisfaction with the food.  A typical comment was \"I've had better...\""}
{"text":"We had brunch Sunday and it was wonderful. Bonnie and Phillip were so accommodating. And it was good to talk with Alan as well. Thank you folks for a lovely afternoon."}
{"text":"Party of 5, 6 pm reservation, show at 8. We didn't get our food until 7:30. We had 15-20 minutes to eat before we had to head out to the show. The service was awful, the waiter mediocre, and all in all a terrible experience especially for the amount of money we spent. What a huge disappointment. Not once did the manager come over to apologize and the waiter kept disappearing for big chunks of time then returning and giving these overly dramatic apologies. We had to ask for bread so someone in our party could take medication (and because we were starving). When the food finally came my husband was given the wrong entree selection, our friend didn't receive her side, and another friends potatoes were raw. Raw! We'll never go back and we will discourage others to do the same."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful! Staff came to talk to us about the menu, explain what the food is and its traditional background or customary way of eating. Food was delicious, eating is always relaxing and enjoyable there."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and was never blown out of the water and at this price point in the burgh I expect to be, but damn, the last time was amazing.  After looking over some of the other reviews, I think we lucked out because we went late after a show without a res and received impeccable service.  From the amuse bouches to the dessert everything was timed perfectly and the food was exactly what you want from creative California cuisine, which by the way, is one of my favorites. 

 I was obsessed with my meal of perfectly cooked filet & scallops served with a shrimp, purple potato and lima bean side over a to die for coconut curry which was the special that night and I hope they make it a permanent surf & turf offering because I'm going to have cravings.  Not one negative word was said at our table and we were kind of a tough crowd.   I've scoffed at Sonoma for not being exciting or delicious enough in the past but last Friday night changed my mind."}
{"text":"Awful service and mediocre food. Going in and going out were terrible experiences due to folks that have no clue about promptness or how to speak to people. Sandwiched between fatty steaks, bland bacon dishes (how do you pull that off?) and stale desserts."}
{"text":"Everything our table of 15 people ordered met with approval. Their crab salad is amazing so is the merguez bruschetta for an appetizer. For the main the duck was crispy and juicy but I am not a big sweet meat fan. The donuts were the perfect ending to a great meal. A good experience all around."}
{"text":"The place trips my trigger. Great food and wine to match! I love eating at the bar and watching the game!"}
{"text":"We went to Sonoma Grille for a nice classy bachelorette party for my sister. The place is very nice and is pretty big! It is beautiful inside. The service was very friendly and the food was amazing! There's some different choices of food which was neat! I would go back for sure! We were having such a good time and was there for a over an hour and a half, that they had another reservation coming in and had to ask us if we could move to the front where the bar is, since they had to do this they bought us a round of drinks/shots which was very generous!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Sonoma for lunch every now and then to break up the work day.  I think the seafood chowder in particular is a tasty (if unhealthy) choice for lunch, served in a bread bowl just like Panera.  I've never been here for dinner, and to be honest I wouldn't really consider going due to two factors.  First, I just don't get the decor or branding.  Fussy, overwrought, dated.  Second, dinner pricing is bordering on outrageous.  Did you know the cioppino is $35?!?  

$35 for a stew is stratospheric.  By way of comparison the cioppino at Neptune Oyster in Boston (hands-down my favorite seafood joint in the world) will set you back $24. 

The fact that Sonoma procures fresh local ingredients is laudable.  Their cooking team is, on the whole, not lacking for technique.  I realize these things cost money.  But at the price point it would have to be as good or better than Eleven and I'm afraid I don't like it more.  I think Sonoma could actually be pretty good with a few changes, namely a renovation and recession-level price adjustment."}
{"text":"Loved this place for Sunday brunch. Prize Fixe menu includes Bloody Mary or Mimosa..The Brunch Burger is boss! Our group had the omelets and chicken and waffles too, everything was good. Service was excellent. Will visit again on another trip!"}
{"text":"Had to ask for bread which didn't arrive until I was half done with my meal.
Red pepper flakes never showed up.
I ordered Cauliflower soup and a tofu on vegetable stir fry. Soup was great. Entree was meh. Tofu was almost tasteless. There are many better ways to use tofu. Food takes forever to show up. Bread pudding was chewy. They did discount my bill without me saying anything. Thumbs up to the manager."}
{"text":"A wine centered eatery that forgot to serve me my glass of wine!!! That sums it up for me. I liked the study of duck but my server seemed to be on another planet! It's menu is tasty but the one time I visited it just didn't seem like everything was running together."}
{"text":"Get your wallet ready.

Huge wine selection, casual dress is okay, and attentive service. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"My coworker and I dined here last night after I mentioned that I had not left the hotel (except for subway) last time we were in town.  I was so pleased! Our server was so friendly and knowledgable about the menu.  He practically had it memorized! It was also obvious that he was passionate about his job and loved the food he served.  I essentially ordered only what he suggested, and he did not lead me wrong!

I had 2-servings of the mixed grille, with salmon and a crab cake over fettuccine.  The fish was perfectly done, full of flavor, and was perfectly complemented by the sides.  The place is a little pricey, but it was a nice treat after such a hard week.  I think it would be a great place for special occasions since it has a dimly-lit and romantic ambiance."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. From the trendy place it used to be to a morgue.  They blame the increased restaurant competition on Penn but the reality is that they have cut way back on service and staff, surly bar staff and generally indifferent service.  The food is the same, basically okay. But it appears ownership is trying to cash out, as the excellent service and vibe of the once trendy restaurant is now only a memory. Huge turnover, sullen employees have lost me. I travel a lot to Pittsburgh, and often stay next door at the Marriott Courtyard. Never again and I gave them several chances."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of being AWESOME. Great service all around. The bartenders are very knowledgeable about all the wines that they have. They have 300 wines so if you like wine this is the place to go. The food is great here. It's expensive so don't go here unless you want to spend some money. A lot of CEO and business owners go here I've noticed from the times that I've gone and talked to some of the people beside me at the bar. Majority of people the people that go here dress up and I mean with dress shirts ties, suit jackets and the ladies with dresses or nice skirts. I cannot say enough good things about this place it's my favorite place to go in all of Pittsburgh for fine dinning."}
{"text":"First time to Pittsburgh, and I decided to give Sonoma Grille a try. It was a beautiful day and the restaurant had a nice, fine-dining atmosphere. I went here as a single guest and waited for several minutes at the hostess table to be seated. The restaurant aside from a larger business party in the rear of the room was pretty much deserted. A new hire came up to me and said \"Has no one been over here to seat you?\" So she took me to my table, where I sat for 20 minutes before I decided that no one was going to take my order. I went to the bar and requested a waitress. I had a white wine, Sonoma Salad and sorbet. The sorbet made it to my table first, which didn't bother me but still unexpected. Then the salad came...so I take responsibility for not reading the menu in regards to the \"tapas\" but it was a very small salad for $9.00. The food was good and the service was spotty (I think I just came at a weird time and I was alone). There are several great restaurants around this area so it seems, so I guess it depends what you are looking for, but I won't be going back anytime soon"}
{"text":"I was not expecting this to be as good as it was, and so I went twice while I was in Pittsburgh for three days.  The wine list is terrific, as you might expect.  The food was interesting and yummy.  The bartenders and servers were friendly, which is not always the case when you're a solo diner.  I will visit here whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"I came here twice in one day. Yes it sounds creepy and weird, but it was Easter and nothing else was open in wonderful Pittsburgh.

The service was excellent, so this review is for the food. I had the mixed grill first - salmon, filet and ahi (all medium rare) over the stir fry. At $33 I have to say it was worth every penny. I was starving and each of the three meats came in generous portions cooked to perfection. 

My second encounter was with a burger which was maybe a 3 at best. I would not recommend the burger! 

The Sonoma decor made me feel like I was close to home in the SF Bay again - I will be back to both!"}
{"text":"Eric made us drinks and fed us dessert.

What a bartender!  He noted he had taken a mixology class earlier in the day and wow, did it inspire him!  Four of our group got custom cocktails. We were wildly impressed.

Also, dessert was killer. Maple creme brulee, NOM.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"We will looking for some atmosphere. We drive by, place looked busy outside so we yelped and decided to go in. We were seated quickly and very nice waitress came over to start the night. Great wine list but very overwhelming. Not cheat. Appetizers we good. The naan was good but avocado and lump crabmeat tower  was awesome a must. Then we ordered the grille with a choice of different 1-2-3 skewers. Not bad but not worth the charge $$. The entertainment was fun. Wait staff dropped a few glasses at different times to keep us alert.  Service was great."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if possible. I walked in today, Sunday, at 2:20pm. Waited nearly 10 minutes to be seated in an almost empty restaurant. I was seated and then waited 15 minutes for a server that never arrived. I closed my menu and walked out the door. Nobody offered to ask why and didn't act like I existed. Extremely disappointing for my first experience with this restaurant. I walked directly across the street to sienna mercato where I was immediately greeted and seated. Then my server came over within 2 minutes of being seated. This is where I sit while I type this review.
What horrible customer service at Sonoma. This was one of the places I had yet to try downtown too. Too bad."}
{"text":"I ended up at Sonoma Grille last night after finding that Meat & Potatoes and Seviche were packed - I'm a big wine fan so this place was also on my radar.  I sat at the bar and have to say that Emily behind the bar who served me was fantastic and incredibly friendly even though she was not only serving patrons at the huge bar (along with one other colleague) but apparently also working the service bar which had a bunch of disgruntled waiters milling around complaining about how long their drink orders were taking.  After a while one of the managers stepped in and helped with the service bar but seriously, I'm not sure how you can expect 2 bartenders to serve dinner and drinks for 20+ people sitting at the bar as well as make/pour drinks for everyone else in this huge restaurant quickly.  Regardless, Emily kept a great attitude and was both friendly and helpful the entire time so kudos to her.

In terms of the wine list, it's huge - and overpriced.  Each glass appeared to be above the wholesale price which I know is somewhat standard at many restaurants but I just feel is way too expensive for someplace focusing on wine which should have a good amount of volume.  As far as I'm concerned, you can have a huge and overpriced wine list if you have a fancy wine preservation system to guarantee everything that's served is perfect - unfortunately Sonoma Grille appeared to have nothing of the sort, just the rubber stoppers that you might use at home when you try in vain to suck out all the air with that little white gadget that barely does anything.  There were a couple higher priced glasses of Pinot Noir that I was interested in drinking but a) the price was just way too high and b) I had no confidence that the wine would be fresh and not oxidized.  Average marks on the wine & cocktail side but certainly nothing great.

On the food, I had the Crispy Indonesian Glazed Duck - I mean, who doesn't like crispy duck?  It was cooked fairly well and served with a nice sauce as well as a few vegetables and cashews - overall a very nice and good tasting dish, but at $28 it's by no means cheap either.  I hope the other food is as good, the menu looks pretty good if a bit overpriced and I'll probably be back - just not nearly as much as I originally thought when I found this place online and was hoping it might be my go-to wine bar in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is a great place overall in food and atmosphere. It's definitely more on the expensive side but it is usually worth it for a nice meal. I like a variety of items but weirdly find the wagyu beef burger to be one of my favorite menu items. They try to keep the food as local and organic as possible from my understanding which is another plus. I generally go here for lunch downtown so I'm not drinking but I would love to come for dinner and try the wine selections."}
{"text":"I've been almost three years in US. There have been only a few times that I truly enjoyed my meal. My experience in Sonoma definitely was one of them."}
{"text":"We ate here last night.  The food is not good and they are understaffed.  Sonoma is consistent with the other restaurants from this group, Nola, Seviche.  I will go back for drinks.  The wine list is extensive but the food is poor. 

Get a glass of wine and eat soemwhere else."}
{"text":"After a Steelers game and a restaurant half full, received excuse after excuse as the service was slow, food slower and we ordered cheese plates and soup.

Waiters tried, this place ill equipped to be successful."}
{"text":"I've been hearing good things about Sonoma Grille for a while and just hadn't had the chance to try it.  A night out to the theater was the perfect opportunity.  It was fantastic.  I started with a delicious mesclun salad and had the Study of Duck signature dish for my entree (though it was a grave diversion from my current diet plan!)  It was so worth it!  It was a trio of different duck preparations, all very unique and tasty with the perfect veggies mixed in.  Delightful small profiteroles for dessert finished off the meal nicely.  The service was excellent.  Our waitress was very helpful in helping us understand the specials and various options, as well as helping us decide when we were overwhelmed by the many wonderful sounding choices.  The ambiance was very soothing--we enjoyed exchanging glances with those at the table next to us admiring each new course as it came out.
Yes it's somewhat pricey, but I left perfectly satisfied and spent less than at several other fine dining establishments of late.  Especially looking to the other options downtown in the cultural district for a pre-theater meal, most of them boast much high per person price tags.  I can't wait to go back to Sonoma Grille--my struggle will be to see if I can tear myself away from the amazing meal I had this first time to try something new!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never been to this downtown restaurant.  I heard such great things and was excited to try their Sunday brunch. I stepped inside and immediately love the relaxed atmosphere and neat décor. They have big round tables which are great for large groups.  Our waiter was fantastic and really knew the ins and outs of the menu.  I decided to go with the prix fix brunch which includes a drink, appetizer and entrée.  I started with a mimosa with fresh squeezed orange juice that was delicious. My only complaint I wish the glass was bigger!  For my starter I went with the sticky buns. They came in a pan and were covered in sticky glaze and a cream cheese frosting-they were decadent! For my entrée I went with the omelet that came with toast and fresh fruit. The omelet had sweet and hot peppers (it was not at all spicy) and sausage. Very tasty and I was surprised by the large portions. Can't wait to go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Had the Med Platter, the hummus was just ok, but the olives, tabbouleh and beet with yogurt were awesome"}
{"text":"It's busy tonight! Still a good place to eat alone at the bar and a local regular at the bar has made the rest of us single eaters very comfortable."}
{"text":"Service was slow- took 30 minutes to get water and we were there am hour before we got our wine. Service was inattentive. Despite a reservation they sat a party who arrived after us and didn't have a Rez. Menu is good. Good is good - portions are modest in size. Overall don't go if you don't have plenty of time to eat."}
{"text":"Service wasn't the best. Took over an hour to receive our food and drinks. Although the server was a pleasant man, he awkwardly watched us pay even when we were giving him a tip which seems a little odd to me. The food is a little pricey. But, simply amazing in taste."}
{"text":"Maybe I gave off that local vibe/funk, but when a friend & I walked in for dinner on a slower weeknight, we were seated after a brief confusion of where to go, and promptly IGNORED by the waitstaff.  When the waitress deigned to grace us with her presence, we ordered a few drinks while reviewing the menu.  We finally got a beverage after another considerable wait. Drank that and left. Went across the street to August Henry's and had a much more pleasant, if not upscale, meal.  Overall, NOT impressed with the Sonoma Grille.  On the plus side, there are lots of other restaurants within steps of this place."}
{"text":"This is a truly restful beautiful venue for a weekend lunch. The staff was more than accomodating to juggle our reservation for us by 20 min due to an unforseen delay, and the food was particularly good both in taste and presentation. The wine list, as one would gather from it's California wine region name and logo, was extensive and varied in choices and price points $-$$$.

We were in a larger group with maybe only 3 or 4 small groups of patio and indoor patrons at most in the restaurant. And wait time on food was longer than expected though our orders had been taken in a timely fashion.

Food delivery to the table was interestingly confusing...hence the 4 stars and not the 5th on my rating. 
It seems the waitress takes the order and also serves beverages but 2-3 servers circled the table delivering our dishes. There first was confusion about who had which soups and salads...

Then on entree delivery the same 2-3 servers swarmed the table quickly placing entrees without asking what they'd ordered, in front of patrons who did not order them so then the switching of plates began. This also encompassed missing or incorrect side dishes to further the chaotic serving.
I really am at a loss as to why so many would serve and do it not even correctly knowing or consulting the waitress who took the order!?

This seems so very cumbersome a process that this establishment had it been a full lunch crowd would've had many  frustrated patrons and group diners! Their process & execution of a concise efficient service to table of orders MUST be streamlined! 

Okay, now the best part of Sonoma Grille - the tastes and flavors of the meat, poultry, seafood and vegan dishes were impeccably spot on!!! Fresh, radiant spicing allowing the flavors of the food to shine! Ingredients were well matched and side dish pairings were colorful and made a very enhanced plating to all the main dish. 

Soups were savory and delicious. Crab bisque topped with creme friache, crab claw beignets and chive slivers was velvety in texture with superb taste. French Onion base was dark, deep noted and satisfyingly savory as well.  

We will frequent the Sonoma Grille again soon. It is a really great place and artistically done decor reflective of Sonoma Valley. We are hoping on return to find the food to table service less confusing and simplified."}
{"text":"Impressive Sunday brunch from the top notch mimosa & bloody mary to the finishing desserts!  Everything worked, the flavors, the service and the live jazz.  Marvelous place to start your Sunday."}
{"text":"Have been to Sonoma Grill many times in the past, but most recently we celebrated my Mother's retirement here and had a wonderful time, so I thought what better time to write a review than now! It's easy to accommodate a large group in their space, which works out well for larger celebrations. It's also in a great location downtown to easily stop at several nearby restaurants for a cocktail pre or post-dinner.

They change their menu seasonally, and it's not always up to date online. But, they still had some wonderful options. We started with the charcuterie and cheese plates. Their house-made speck was fabulous! For the main course, I had the bronzed salmon which was fantastic. It was served over a sweet potato hash and pancetta braised greens. Others in our party chose the ribeye and the mixed grill. The mixed grill is a great way to try 1, 2, or 3 options of steak, fish, chicken, etc paired with various sides and sauces. I love that they continue to always have this option on the menu with rotating dishes. The ribeye was also fantastic. It was cooked perfectly and had a wonderful char of herbs on the outside. This was also served with bone marrow. 

Our server was pleasant and handled a large party with ease. Overall, it was a great place to celebrate my Mom's retirement. We all left pleased with our meals and had a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"Overall a horrible dining experience! The food was lackluster. The steak was on the tough side and the chicken was so bland. The worst offender, however, was the service, which was unbelievably rude. The waitress asked \"if we've been here before\" and when we replied that we had, she came back with \"really?\" in a tone that wreaked of pompousness. It's a standard question we've been asked 100s of times, but that was a first. That was just the beginning. My husband and I were going to the ballet so we had a time limit, which she knew going into the meal. However, it took over 30 minutes to get our cheese plate and we never got the second round of drinks we order. It wasn't crowded either, there were 3 other small tables in our section and the restaurant was virtually empty. Nevertheless the waitress was MIA the whole night. At one point she left the food beside us on the tray then walked away to the bar leaving the food there for 5 minutes. We were tempt to just serve ourselves. When we told her we were in a hurry she responded with \"I know.\" Unfortunately we weren't the only people that had a problem. We talked to the couple next to us and they were just as upset- they told us she was just as rude to them and eventually they just put their money on the table and left cancelling their dessert. We could hear and see how frustrated the women (only 3 people mind you) seated near us were with the service. We made it to the ballet with only minutes to spare. Sonoma needs to step up their game, there is lots of competition coming in and right now they are failing to provide quality food or service. The only positive marks... the wine."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service left much to be desired. We had a work function with approximately 12 attendees and neither the management nor the waitstaff had the foresight to provide us with a dedicated waitress. Sat for over 45 minutes after giving the waitress our drink order before she took our appetizer order. By the time she got around to getting our dinner order they were out of their most popular items. Sorely disappointed. Maybe ok for small parties. If you're planning to go with a large group. Make other plans. Many other nice places to go in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We went to Sonoma Grill for brunch.   Service was incredible from a friendly, expert waiter.  He was fun and knowledgeable.  He even brought a coffee to may son at exactly the right time without being asked when he said he would order one later.  You can't get better than that.  The good was very good for brunch.  My son and I had steak and eggs, nicely done. My wife had a layered mound of avocado and crab, very California and really excellent.  The room was uncrowded.  They have a long and excellent wine list, with some of our favorite from trips to Napa and Sonoma valleys.  We had checked out of the hotel and just wanted to linger for some time on the sidewalk cafe.  It was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Pretty expensive for the value of food. Small portions. Great tapas appetizer. Great wine list. Not worth the money. Decor is very cheesy. Really fake flowers."}
{"text":"For all of the foodies out there looking for a local oriented fresh restaurant, Sonoma Grille is your place. It may not be orginal to Pittsburgh, but their whole mission is to produce tapas styled-california themed dishes. Which brings me into their extensive very well perfomed wine list, that the servers are very on point with. Not all of their food is tapas styled, but their appetizers most definately are what we call TAPAS, and this is a restaurant that creates their own infused oil, and amuse bouche's for the some of you not getting an appetizer. The entire decor is California to a T, or from what I see on the movies at least, I have yet to travel out west. But from the decor, to the service to their food this is your california restaurant in Pittsburgh, and yes this an upscale restaurant and it is pricy but if you want a bang for your buck, this is the place you need to try.
As for my night, there was a group of 8, and yes us smart culinary students did make a reservation. RESERVATIONS ARE RECOMMENDED, wherever you go. As somebody who has been a lead hostess, either take the time to make the reservation or quit your bitchin'. Back to my night we had one large round table which is great and easy to communicate with each other, I started off with a glass of Washington Riesling, and that's just my type of wine. I actually had two glasses. I decided not to over-stuff myself and wait for my main entree. We were served their amuse bouche for the night, which was a little toasted crostini with bruschetta styled tomatoes. (It was Bruschetta, who am I kidding?) You seriously can't mess up bruschetta in my mind. I had the toss up between the Asian style duck or the Lamb Osso Bucco. I decided to go with my least second choice and get the Lamb Osso Bucco, as I watched my friend devour the Asian style Duck, which I regretted not getting. Not that I didnt like my Lamb, because that was too on point, with different root vegetables then your original, as in rutabaga, and parsnips, etc.. and the lamb, fell right off the bone, perfect really, especially when you got some of that mouth watering fresh shaved parmesan cheese on top. However I REALLY wanted that dang duck. Which I did get to try my friends and can vouche for her devouring that plate, because I have yet to go to Sonoma and have BAD DUCK. I want it right now, it was that good, I love their duck. 
Running into the dessert, I told the waiter Eric, to suprise me. He returned with their orange and cranberry bread pudding. Can't go wrong with bread pudding ever. Especially theirs, candied orange peel, marmalade, and cranberries all over that bread pudding goodness. However their apple neapolitan, SAY WHAT! Should have gotten that, their layer of sour apple sorbet, tasted as if you were biting into a green bright juicy granny smith apple, their desset chef Kerri, has it goin' on. 
I am most definately a fan of Sonoma Grille and would recommend it to all non-foodies and foodies who can truly appreciate the difference in styles of food, culture and atmosphere, and a great time."}
{"text":"(06/12/2011) Was somewhat skeptical when the first thing the waiterperson (a little pretentiously) divulged was the concept -- \"earth to plate\", and this in the middle of downtown Pittsburgh, but the food was delicious, and overall the dining experience very pleasant. One dining companion got the Sonoma Mixed Grill, which she thoroughly enjoyed. Just because I can't help myself, went with the 4-plate tasting menu, as did another dining companion, so essentially got to taste 8 different dishes (in order below).

WILD MUSHROOM FLATBREAD
* Great salty (olive) and creamy (goat cheese) foils to the earthy/umami mushrooms. Piled high, very high topping to bread ratio, not finger food.

TEMPURA SHRIMP
* Light, crispy tempura battered shrimp, executed well, not very surprising.

SONOMA SALAD
* Nice cool crisp mix of sweet and salty. Dijon vinaigrette nicely tart, mild blue cheese (could've used a little more).

AVOCADO AND CRABMEAT TIAN
* Mild, sweet crab complemented by creamy avocado, brightened with a chili oil, and some tartness from limes.

CRISPY INDONESIAN GLAZED DUCK
* Beautifully crisped, mahogany skinned duck leg, tender meat, crisp vegetables in sweet soy, the veg and starch cut the fattiness of the duck well; nice mix of crunchy and crispy (veg and rice cake crust) vs. tender meat and moist sushi rice (cake insides).

PECAN CRUSTED HALUOMI
* Some surprising sweet-hot heat, haloumi warmed through (not a melting cheese) and crisply fried. textures sort of melded together, mango fruitiness overshadowed by creaminess on creaminess (cheese, potato, avocado).

ORGANIC LOCH DOURT SALMON
* More pedestrian than the previous plates. Salmon touch overdone, sharp acidic slaw, with some heat nice balance to the mildness fish.

FILET MIGNON 
* Most pedestrian of the plates. While nice to eat, hearts of palm seemed superfluous, blue cheese a little lost in the creamed potatoes, well-executed medium rare filet."}
{"text":"I find it hard to believe I have to write this review. I came with a business colleague after a convention Wed, Jan 25th 2017 @ 7:00 . I ordered a seafood dish over risotto  that was served on a hot skillet ( can't remember the name but it was the most expensive entree on the menu.) After I ordered a large party came in after us. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen after that. After waiting over 25 minutes for our meal I finally complained. Our waiter immediately appeared with our meals. He informed me not to touch the skillet as it was hot.  I took a piece of shrimp and it was cold and rubbery. I felt the skillet and it was warm but not hot as he warned me. I asked an employee to get our waiter. I explained it was cold. He said he would take it back and have it remade. As i waited I watched a blond waitress with a hair bun carrying a few plates almost drop a plate of their tater tot appetizer.  She stopped the plate from falling by pinning it against her body. She then tilted the plate forward saving the dish with her bare hands. I then watched her serve it to a customer. I asked the customer I was with how his was. He chuckled and said his was cold but did not want to say anything. After 10 minutes or so my meal came back. Looking at it I realized it was the same plate. The depression I made in it from pushing my finger in it to check temperature was still there, all they did was stick it back in the oven. I tried a calamari and it was rubber. the risotto was now play-doh consistency and burnt to the bottom of the pan. Never did the waiter return to see how my meal was. He only stopped back to give me the check and tell me my entree was taken off the bill. I told him I hope so and I did not eat any of it. When he returned, with the bill to sign, he had a bag in his hand and offered me a free chocolate mousse. Before I could say anything he said a table paid for it and left it on the table!! Yes! He offered me someone else's food!!!  I put the time and date on this so the manager can identify the employees and hopefully remember me."}
{"text":"Nice cocktails. My friend had the crab BLT and reminds me about it at least once a day. It seems that the menu has changed recently, but Sonoma has a nice vibe and a good kitchen and waitstaff."}
{"text":"It amazes me when I run into someone working as a waiter or waitress who doesn't understand that when people are dining out they aren't just purchasing food, but rather both the food and the experience which goes along with it.
This past Saturday my friend and I were visiting downtown Pittsburgh and had a lot of choices as to where we would dine and after 30 minutes of placing our order at The Sonoma Grille, we knew we had made a bad choice. 
Our waiter was arrogant and distant with us, seeming as if he had everything else but our dinner on his mind. 
After placing our order and and receiving our water we waited almost 15 minutes before having to flag down our waiter and asking him if he had forgotten our bread. He simply said he'd get it. 10 minutes later it showed up at our table, delivered by someone else.
His disconnect with us and lack of attention left us wanting more, and was probably the reason why when our food showed up, that it was prepared wrong.
Although my dinner partners food was correct, my medium well done meat was almost raw inside. No waiter to be found anywhere, so I approach who looked like the manager, who went into the kitchen to correct my order. 15 minutes later I approach the manager again, asking him if they had forgotten about my meal.
10 minutes later he reappeared with my food, which I declined to eat, since our meal had been ruined by this time. NOW, finally our waiter shows up to stand behind the manager as he explains that he would wrap my meat to go. As our waited stood behind him with a smug grin on his face, I couldn't help but think that he was in the wrong line of work and that we had just wasted our money since we really never got to eat together in reality.
I truly am amazed at this fine looking restaurant and the fact that they do serve good food, but that they forget that more than half a dinner experience is in the presentation and atmosphere and that although the food is good, they completely ruined our evening with not just bad service, but a lack of service completely. 
What good is serving good food if you serve it prepared incorrectly, not on time and with an attitude I wouldn't accept from anyone in passing let alone someone whose job it is to make sure our dining experience is an enjoyable one."}
{"text":"Friday night in Pittsburg and I decided to go to Sonoma Grill. Finding parking was crazy since all the parking garages were full, so luckily found some alley way parking. I was late for my reservation but I was seated quickly. This place was live- friendly older crowd. The waiter was nice and suggested the tappas. The server who served us the tappas struggled to place the food on this wooden stand and he looked like he was sick, since he was coughing all over the place. The tappas were great but I wasn't a fan of the brushcetta (tasted goaty) and the scallops with sweet potato puré was too sweet. Otherwise, the canelloni was very filling & filet mignon just melted in my mouth it was amazing."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch at Sonoma Grille a few weeks ago when we were visiting Pittsburgh. Very nice atmosphere, nice decorating and color scheme. Our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu.

My food was good. I had the pork belly tacos. Very good flavor of the pork belly and the tacos were homemade. My wife had the Bahn Mi which is a Korean BBQ. Unfortunately it was overly sweet and did not have enough of the pickled vegetables. Overall the food was very fresh and delicious....my wife just did not enjoy hers as much as she anticipated. Still, a good restaurant that I would recommend."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the great service, the venison and the creme brulee.  Not 5 stars because it is a bit over priced.  Even so, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"On Saturday January 30th two friends and I had reservations at Sonoma. Two of us had eaten at Sonoma a few times prior and really enjoyed the food and wine selection. On 1/30 we were seated immediately. It only took each of us about 60 seconds to realize we made a mistake. The menu has changed and sadly is nothing short of awful. The menu seriously lacks selection. I kid you not there were probAbly 6 things to choose from and barely an appetizer. As far as seafood salmon was about the only choice. We sent back a $50 bottle of wine and went to McCormick and Schmidts for a $300 meal. We are not cheap buyers. Our group originally chose Sonoma based on past experience. Unless menu is fixed we won't be back. Real shame the place was a good go to."}
{"text":"I ordered pancakes for brunch which said they came with maple syrup. There was no maple syrup  (I asked)."}
{"text":"Had a very nice dinner here for 3 couples.  Food and service was excellent.  Asparagus soup de jour was the highlight."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. I was surprised  this place was open for lunch on a weekend. The menu was limited but decent choices. I had an omelet and it was delicious. The service was 5 stars. We had to wait to be seated because the hostess dissapeared and the bartender didn't know how to use the seating chart. I would like to try this place for dinner and drinks. the wine list is huge but expensive."}
{"text":"Food is great. But, I can only give 4 stars due to repeated incredibly slow service. As I write this, I have waited 14 minutes since the dessert menu was brought to me. Took 30 minutes for my entre.  This has happened here several times before. Have been late for shows at Benedum Center after leaving more than ample time for a meal. It is a shame as the food is very good but I don't usually intend to spend an entire evening dining."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, the wine list long and it was attached to my hotel.   The good was a little on the plain and pricey side but if your staying at the Courtyard and don't feel like going far it's easy and good enough."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Servers were well versed in the menu and offered up good suggestions.  Started with chicken tortilla soup -delicious.  I got the Monk Fish special, very tasty.  Desserts were unique blends.  I had an Espresso Creme Brûlée that was very good.  I would definitely go back next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This was connected to our hotel so my husband and I decided to go down for a couple drinks. We sat at the bar and had a wonderful bartender. We asked her to just create a good mix drink using Gin and she surprised us with a delicious mixture. We also got an appetizer and everything was great!"}
{"text":"Ill say the food itself- was very good but the portions like literally one or two bite and yours done. Severly over priced for the quantity given. The wait to sit was about 45 minutes when the restaurant was about 1/4 full. Im confused if you cant handle serving every table you have in the house on a weekend night, then why do you have so many seats? One of the staff made a snark remark that we would have to wait that long in order to provide the best service because they had large parties ( i saw no more than 6 people at any table), and this remark was unprompted as all i did was ask how long it would be and then it was silent as i thought about what to do. Luckily i was being sugardaddied for the meal but, the restaurant itself came off very haughty and snobby for no good reason. Also, they have wine tasting but theyre not a winery? The restaurant just buys fancy wines and serves them as a wine tasting? 

Also the server went innnnn on explaining the menu a little too much, it was invasive it didnt come off as knowledgeable, it came off as a little forced too suggestive. I can read a menu and ill decide for myself thanks."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with friendly knowledgeable staff. Jay was my server and Eric the bartender. Both were excellent. Met a couple of the managers of whom were top notch, don't remember their names though. A must have on their dinner menu is the Cioppino!"}
{"text":"So today has become a very special day in my life.  It's the day I met the man of my dreams for the first time and where else but Sonoma Grille. It's not just about the food but the staff that makes this dynamo of an eatery extraordinary.  

We met at 1:00pm being 2 of 6 people in the entire place. We enjoyed great wine and a spectacular dish of crab tian which hands down is the best appetizer ever.  3.5 hours later we turned around in our chairs to a room filled with people without noticing a change throughout our time together. It was the most amazing ambiance for a perfect day. 

Recently we visited only to be told crab tian was  no longer offered on their menu.  We were so disappointed.  However, today being the special day it is for me, I called to special request this dish be prepared in honor of our special memory and as a take out at that. Alena the hostess placed me on hold, spoke with Elizabeth the manager and made it happen.  I sit at the bar today enjoying a late lunch feeling happiness beyond words  and so grateful to this outstanding staff while enjoying my delicious meal in my special seat. 

Thank you Sonoma Grille for preserving my memories!  You guys ROCK!!!  It's the small things that count."}
{"text":"In a word - OUTSTANDING!! From John the manager to Eric to Jessica to Amber to the servers & hostess whose names we didn't catch, everybody there is welcoming and friendly. The food is outstanding. My wife loved the diver scallops & I especially enjoyed the mixed grill w'/fabulous dipping sauces. Also loved the smoked salmon pierogi. Did I mention we went on Valentine's Day w/no reservation & they squeezed us in, treating us like old friends. Loved it so much we went back the next night! Great wine list & great location. Definitely recommend & will be back next time we hit Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Very Cheesecake Factory-ish. A gaudy, overdone take on what Sonoma must be like. Thick rope cords, blown glass, velvet curtains, Trompe L'oeil. I wasn't fooled. The appetizers were mediocre. Chicken skewers, no flavor. I had the prime rib. I asked for medium rare, but when the server brought it out, he said, here's the medium. I said no, medium rare, and he unflinchingly said OK, this IS medium rare. Well, it was definitely medium, and since I didn't want to make a fuss (it was a big work dinner), didn't want to send it back. To his credit, he did come back once to double check and I just waved him away. Dessert was also unmemorable.

Overall, OK at best."}
{"text":"I was treated to lunch here and even for a free lunch it was not satisfying.

First my french onion soup had very little flavor, almost watered down.  The cheese was overcooked and clumping and the bread was just... bread in my soup.

I had the short ribs for my entree.  The ribs where extremely dry and overcooked.  The portions are small and the meat was so inedible that I didn't even finish my meal.  What flavor that was infused was just sauce cooked onto the meat and no flavor from the meat itself.  I was extremely disappointed.

My guess is that they garner the majority of their business from out of towners staying in the hotel it is connected to.  This will definitely not be in my lunch rotation downtown."}
{"text":"Dined here with my sister during her visit to Pittsburgh. Wine list was amazing. Service was excellent- actually some of the best service I've ever experienced. Food was top-notch, both classic and inventive. A bit pricey but totally worth it. Great for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Lovely environment. Excellent atmosphere for a relaxing romantic dinner. The food however was \"meh\". The roasted red pepper  bisque was a moving experience but the french onion, was \"interesting\" at best. I appreciate eclectic menus but this one was a little over the top in its effort to sauce and truffle. We didn't try the Tapas but the selections seemed underwhelming. Go with the Panzanella salad and the roasted red pepper bisque.

Try something off of the drinks menu and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"Well, there went that high.

I'm going to downgrade Sonoma to a (3), simply because our first experience there was enough to make me hold on to some glimmer of hope.  Unfortunately, when a large group of friends decided to get brunch there a few Sundays ago, it blew a hole through my previous high regards.

Sonoma again was relatively empty (odd for the booming Sunday brunch trend in PGH), so service shouldn't of been a concern.  Unfortunately the trend quickly became empty water and mimosas.

Relative to the food.  Sonoma enforces a two or three course brunch selection that represents your standard Sunday morning fare.  The wife's crab cake benedict was forgettable, and my key lime french toast (at the server's recommendation) more or less tasted like strait sugar with no lime in sight.  The most disappointing part of the entire experience was the hype we all built towards the smores dessert crepes, only to realize they were almost inedible (no one at the table finished them).  When a serve admits that they're horrible (after the fact...  thanks), you know there's a growth opportunity.

I'll give it a show for lunch maybe, but it'll definitely be awhile until I'm back....  bummer."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed going here. The atmosphere, energy, service, food...all very, very good. For dinner, I split the tapa appetizer along with the mushroom flatbread with my friend. We also had a samore martini (we each had our own).. Yum! Except for the grren olives they put in the mushroom flatbread, I thoroughly enjoyed the appetizers. Each one of the five tapas were so precisely made with great presentation and combination of flavors.

Kids grilled cheese was the best. Fries were great. Chiken tenders tasty. Chicken sandwich was good too. Waiter was very polite and communicated with the kids in such a pateint manner. I was so impressed with everything here. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The special was amazing. My favorite was the mini dessert. Excellent outdoor dining experience!"}
{"text":"I went to Sonoma with a large group for a team dinner. We ordered for the table:

-Tapas platter (the best were the divers scallops)
-Wild mushroom flatbread (good toppings, tough flatbread)
-Avocado and crabcake tian (basically like a tartare; I enjoyed it)
-Green mango and curry crab cakes (yummy; curry is subtle but gives it a nice unusual kick)

I ordered the cioppino, which was great but was somewhat underwhelming. Portion sizes are fairly generous. Scallops and mussels were fresh, but the market fish--salmon--was tough and uninspired. 

Pittsburgh has so many incredible restaurants doing interesting, inventive things. Sonoma is not one of them. In pursuit of more adventurous culinary experiences, I would not return here."}
{"text":"Where to begin? Arrived at around 9:30 after Bronco/Steeler game on a Sunday evening. Were seated promptly and our first waiter came right over and gave a detailed run down on the menu. We had to  flag down the manager to actually take our order after waiting over 20 min. We only ordered soup, salad, cheese and charcuterie plat as well as 2 desserts-nothing that required much prep time. We waited and waited and waited. Finally begged the manager to bring our food. All but the soups and salad arrived-a good hour after we were seated. The charcuterie and cheese plates were tiny (8 pieces of salami and a fatty piece of something the resembled uncooked bacon but was apparently duck) and a cheese plate with small chunks of cheese. When we again asked the manager where was our soup/salad he said he would comp our entire meal (hence the one star on the review). He also told us he made the salad himself! Not sure why, but our original waiter slid by our table several times never making eye contact or acknowledging us again. The dessert was good-bread pudding as was the  sonoma salad and the 2 soups. But we were treated shabbily-perhaps because we were not ordering full entrees? We had come to Pittsburgh for a family holiday celebration and this was certainly a low point!! We also complained to the hotel next door since they two are adjoining and this restaurant provides room service to the Courtyard hotel. I would not recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try! You have to request Adam as your server! He was so knowledgable and fun. Made our girls night experience amazing. The food and drinks were excellent. Definitely a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"Disappointed last night, for the first time in all our visits to Sonoma. Partially because I may have just decided on something that I didn't enjoy as much as I thought I would.

However, the server had very little knowledge of the menu and when asked their opinion they basically gave it a coin flip response.  More so of their attentiveness to our table, as they walked passed several times and barely made eye contact with us or noticed that our wine & water were completely empty.  Was practically through the main course by the time I had my 2nd glass & only got that when I could finally grab their attention. 

Have not encountered this server in past visits. We're usually blown away by not only the meal, but also the server who really added to the experience. Perhaps we caught this person on a bad night. Or, just had too high of an expectation since our recent visits we simply had asked for the Chef's Table & were amazed with the meal from start to finish.  In this particular visit they clearly were not up to par with other waitstaff.  Was planning on dessert as it was a birthday dinner, but ended up passing as I just wasn't feeling like it by that point.  3 stars for the food / can't say much of a rating was deserved from the service."}
{"text":"Bonnie was fantastic today as well as Phillip. They accommodated us and were very friendly, knowledge and flexible! Thanks for a great brunch today!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. We went here for restaurant week and unlike other restaurants that changed their menus to include something cheaply made with a upscale twist, Sonoma used items that were on their regular menu.

The wine selection was extensive but pricey. 

We had a good experience and would definitely go back. If you are staying in the hotel next door definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"We went to Sonoma Grille for the opening.
The service was a little slow to start with but picked up and we wouldn't hold it against them.
The tapas for 2 has a nice variety and is a good sized portion for an appetizer.
We tried the mixed grille with  2 choices and split between 2 people which provided right sized portions for 2 women.
Everything was delicious. Good sauces and sides."}
{"text":"I had heard many good words for this place.  So I was attending a conference at the convention center and I decided to go there for lunch.  The place is very impressive and has a nice bar as well.  However, the food was not very impressive and the variety small.  Nevertheless, I have to say that it might be the lunch menu that has less variety.  I will have to try the dinner menu as well."}
{"text":"When you mess with my momma, you mess with me.  Okay, it's not THAT serious, but...  

I was out with mumsie for a pre-theater dinner this past Saturday night at one of my favorite lunch spots, Sonoma Grille.  Having never enjoyed dinner here I thought it a safe bet since the majority of my experiences lunching and brunching had been fabulous to date.  The goods news - I [mostly] enjoyed my Mixed Grill (loved the Branzino/didn't love the pork shank/salty stir-fry) and she thought her pork tenderloin was delicious.  Unfortunately, our overall experience was sullied by slow service and less-than-welcoming management.  We arrived shortly after 6pm and were promptly seated by an exceptionally courteous hostess then greeted by our server Dominic, a true delight with a 100-megawatt smile.  At 6:35pm we received our drinks.  It was a beautiful day and we weren't in a huge rush so the wait didn't both me too much.  The issue came when the manager (I'm assuming) interrupted Dominic while he was taking our order to instruct him to give the [freshly-seated] table next to us extra care.  I could've let that go, but as I waited patiently I watched the aforementioned table receive their entrees before we even had a bread basket.  The moral of the story is, we enjoyed our meals and made it to the show on time, but left feeling like VUPs (Very Unimportant People).  With so many incredible options downtown I'll likely look elsewhere for our next dinner."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner reservation here a few weeks ago.  The hostess went to seat us and the available seating inside was sporadic, and somewhat uncomfortable IE sitting in the smallest communal booth between two big parties.  I asked if we could go outside, where we quickly found a table and began looking over the menus.  

I've been here a couple of times with some mixed feelings about the service, but really loved the food.  For this trip I started with the Pennsylvanian which was bourbon, st germaine, lavender & bitters.  Albeit a little pricey, but to be expected, it was darn good.  It packed a nice punch and the lavender lent small traces of floral through the cocktail. Pleasant and refreshing on this summer day.

Since my last visit they have altered their menu, and my once beloved duck dish was omitted.  I decided to do a mixed grill with two selections, grilled salmon, striped bass, with vegetable stir-fry and it came with dipping sauces.  Entrees came out in a reasonable time and I dug in.  First I would note that unless you are not hungry, getting only one selection will leave you needing more.  The pieces were not large but with the two selections together were enough to satisfy my hunger and both were cooked well and seasoned nicely.  Now to the major disappointment on my plate, my vegetable stir fry.  After eating them I felt like I had downed a bottle of soy sauce.  They were drenched in sauce and so, so salty.  I managed to eat most of them mainly because I was hungry and didn't want to waste this pricey meal but really they were not good.  To top it off they weren't cooked right either.  I like some bite to my cooked veggies but some of the pieces were raw.  The celery literally crunch in my mouth like a raw stock.  If it wasn't for how undercooked the veggies were I would have guessed that these came out of a frozen microwaved bag with a premade sauce already on them.  Hard to believe a chef would have prepared that for an upscale restaurant.  Lesson learned and please bring back the duck!  

Everything else was good to better than good, but the food needed a little help. The servers and hostesses were very nice and accommodating this visit."}
{"text":"This restaurant has pros and cons. The hostess was less than pleasant. We waited on a table at the bar, but we had to ask for it again about an hour and a half later. It appeared that we were bothering the hostess because we wanted a table and she was going to have to set it. She was less than appreciative of our patronage. Not something you would really like when your dropping $150 on dinner for two. The bar had poor service. The bar tender seemed depressed and was not attentive. Had it not been for the bar back up we prob would not have gotten our drinks and cheese plate. When we did get to our table the waiter was fantastic and turned things around. He exceeded our waiter expectations and made the large restaurant feel small. My husband had the duck. He thought it was ok- not anything memorable. I had the pork tenderloin. It was good. The plate had a nice presentation which I appreciated. The best thing by far was the dessert. It was a pistachio cheesecake with a bourbon glaze and candied cornflakes. The dessert had a lot going on, but it was so complimentary. It worked very well together. Hats off to the pastry chef!! I really wish I could rate this place higher, but the hostess really prevented that. I would like to return some time and see her not there-- hint hint!"}
{"text":"The wait staff is ever so endearing.  I was dining here alone and my waiter went out of his way to carry on a  conversation with me.  I am conversationally akward but I appreciated the gesture none the less."}
{"text":"My review will only be about the bar area and drinks as we did not have food here tonight.  After having dinner at a nearby place, we decided to go here for drinks.

I must say, I always love coming here for wine/cocktails.  Happy hour Mon-Fri is between 5pm and 7pm where they offer $5.00 wines/cocktails as well as a discount on Tapas.  I do like the fact they offer $20 bottles for happy hour as well.  

The bar is a fully stocked bar with a good amount of top shelf liquor.  The drink menu includes many signature drinks, old time cocktails, beer, wine and liquor.  The menu is laid out in a nice way for you to easily find what you are looking for.  

I enjoy the wine list tremendously.  They offer wine flights in addition to wines by the glass and bottles.  The wine list offers many Old World and New World selections (though most selections are from the USA....but I am willing to help them expand their wine list for more Old World selections...ha) and focuses on many different styles.  They have Sparkling wines, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Gewürztraminer, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel, Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon...etc.  

Service here was extremely friendly.  I asked the bartender if he made a 'specialty' drink.  He said he did and that it was bourbon based.  I asked him to make it for me, which is happily did.  It was Four Roses bourbon, St. Germain, orange bitters and a simple syrup.  The cocktail was really good, almost too good, I could put these back quickly.  

I really enjoy coming here for drinks and will certainly return again!"}
{"text":"I had a date night with the wife this past Saturday and we had a fun time at Sonoma Grille. It helped that the kids were home and we could sit back and just enjoy ourselves.

First, a congrats to James our server and his partner. They were attentive, gave guidance and were thorough. This was our third time with James and he has a booming voice and we went with what he suggested. 

I ordered a bottle of merlot, \"6 Clones\" and I encourage everyone to buy wine here. A huge selection. I like the presentation when they open it too. ;)

We both had soups. I enjoyed the cream of asparagus with cauliflower and the W went with the Fisherman's Wharf Chowder. They were both awesome but I think she had the better one. I enjoyed the Crispy Indonesian Glazed Duck which was a cool mix of flavors. I'm not a huge risotto fan but this hit the spot. My wife went with the special. I can't remember the name but it was a lobster and lamb dish. I thought mine looked better but she insisted on me trying hers and it did not disappoint.  

Try to add this place to your nice dinner rotations. It is definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"Add Sonoma Grill to the list of quality, dining options in downtown Pittsburgh. 

I made reservations (strongly recommended) for a late dinner and we arrived early, hoping to get a table sooner. No dice, so we fought for drinks at the very crowded bar, where wine is definitely their specialty. Even with a number of bartenders the service was spotty and I couldn't get a clear answer if we needed to settle up before eventually heading to our table. (In the end, they combined our bar and dinner tabs.)

However, once we were seated the quality of service rose dramatically. Our waitress was so personable and informative with the dinner specials and her recommendations. Once she described how the \"Free Range Venison from New Zealand is so tender it melts in your mouth\" I was sold. But first, we decided to start with one of her appetizer recommendations, the Scratch Gnudi, delicious ricotta dumplings that didn't last long, even with six of them to share.

Once our meals arrived, I realized the venison was actually shoulder chops and not a filet, like I thought. My mistake for not reading the description closely. Although it was tender and tasted great, there just wasn't enough of it to compliment the risotto and carrots to fill me up. However, we solved that problem with a shared order of Espresso Crème Brûlée served with a small scoop of Salted Caramel ice cream, a delicious and wonderful finale to a satisfying, but pricey, Saturday evening."}
{"text":"The food was average the vegetables weren't that great the service was pitiful the server obviously liked the girls next to me better than me of course so they got all the attention and I was left waiting sorry grapes. Lol"}
{"text":"This was our second and last visit to Sonoma Grille. Service was friendly and attentive, but food was sub-par. Our last visit we felt the food had mixed reviews. Some things were good, some were just OK. This visit, almost everything we ordered was below standards for the price. Duck and appys were decent, but nothing to rave about. The venison dish was just awful! The pate was not good at all and the toast points were burnt! (Seriously?) The root veggies were NOT seasoned and under cooked! (Seriously?) The small serving of trout was just mediocre as it sat on a MOUNTAIN of mashed potatoes. The other trout dish came with undercooked rice. It could hardly be chewed. No sense in sending things back because we had to go to the show and were running out of time as it was. On top of the overpriced offerings, they have the nerve to charge you and extra charge for shot sized sauces the accompany your meals. (Seriously?!) Well, the only thing we 
are seriously sure about is that we will not be back to Somona Grille again. There are too many other better options in town for that to happen again."}
{"text":"Pear cider sangria to die for! Fabulous ambiance, and super nice knowledgeable staff. Killed 2 hours surfing net and drinking sangria, and wishing I was hungry. Will definitely eat here when I'm back through Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"My experience at Sonoma Grille was terrible.  We just left the restaurant about 15 minutes ago and I am writing this review while the experience is still fresh in my mind. 

My husband and I were excited to try Sonoma despite its relatively high prices, basic menu, and muted Olive Gardenish decor.  We very much looked forward to the night out but were shocked by the inexperienced waitress, the poor service, and the undercooked food. 

We ordered appetizers, a salad, and 2 main dishes.  My husbands pork was completely rare and cold when it came out.  Instead of taking the entire dish away, the waitress suggested he just put the pork on a small side dish so it could be re-heated.  Um, what??  Seriously?  For a fine dining restaurant, no dish should come out raw nor should the meat be separated from the rest of the dish to cure the problem.  Kind of ruins the idea of serving a \"dish\" afterall.   The rest of the food was ok, but, not worth the high price tag.

So then we sat and waited.  And waited.  I finished my entire meal before my husband even got his served at the right temperature. It was strange, awkward, and sad not to be able to share what is supposed to be a fine dining experience with my husband. 

The manager, Kevin,  came over 3 times, asking \"is there anything we can do for you?\" and \"Sir, sorry, next time this won't happen\".   Well, needless to say, there will not be a next time. 

And the answer to \"Is there anything we can do for you?\"  is basic restaurant management, Kevin.... you either comp the meal or at least comp a glass of wine.  You did neither.  And we didn't ask because we aren't that type."}
{"text":"Great restauant.  Food is creative and delicious.  We could not decide and took two extra entrees home! All were incredible.  The made our anniversary very special as well.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We had both lunch and dinner here Saturday as we were staying in the Marriott next door and it was so convenient.  Also, the lunch was good, making the dinner decision seem easier.  The Bistro Salad with Grilled Chicken was good at lunch; the earth didn't move, but it was pleasant and hit the spot.  My son liked his hamburger, my wife didn't complain about her sandwich.  But dinner.....  What is with waiters' and busboys' insane desire to grab every plate that is less than half full of food??  And when you have to interrupt your meal to say don't take that plate, I am still eating that food that you can see on it -- and when you have to do this at least TWICE!! -- I feel ashamed that I left a normal tip.

Without the decent lunch (later than normal time, so the restaurant was not crowded), this would be a one-star review.  My dinner entree of Mixed Grill was disappointing.  I guess I should have let those guys take it away!  The vegetable stir-fry was pathetic -- tasteless, undercooked, dullsville.  The filet chunks were fine and the mushrooms.... well, if I have to describe mushrooms, it could not have been a very inspiring dinner, could it?  The waitstaff needs a reeducation class.  But the buck should stop where it belongs, at the restaurant manager.  Get to work, buddy!  Think about your customers, not your dishwasher."}
{"text":"Food was average. Interesting choices and attentive service.  Portions were a little small served in smaller dishes to make it seem filled. Will try them again."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I were on our way home to DC, and were trying to find a good, yet unpretentious place to eat.  it was 103 degrees out, late June, and we were dressed for it.  My husband was in khaki walking shorts and a polo, I was in capris and a tank top, our daughter in shorts and a skirt.

We passed on the first restaurant after the Maitre'd asked how short my husband's walking shorts were.  We walked out of another when the Maitre'd gave our 7-year old \"the look\", and we walked out of another due to a 1.5 hour wait-list...and then we came here.

No wait.  Children's menu.  Summer attire no problem.  Ok wine list.  Great service, great food.  We'd come back here any time we're driving through town again."}
{"text":"This restaurant saved me.   Had a meal here every day on my trip to Pittsburgh.

The omelette is fantastic!
Reason:  It's not a basic, flavorless diner omelette, rather it's full of vegetables and goat cheese, very large fluffy with great taste.  High end omelette.  Got it with a side of fruit as well.  

Salmon burger: got to try it! 
Reason:  Just the perfect combination of bread and salmon in the patty.  Crispy and so tasty while not heavy at all.  I really like the sauce on it as well, but the bun could definitely be upgraded.  Too simple of a bread choice, with the amount of healthier bread/bun options we have today."}
{"text":"I really wasn't expecting to like this restaurant but I'm glad I tried it. I went here with four other people after a Steelers game and was pleasantly surprised. The service was fantastic, the selection of food was extensive which is great. The have one of the best wine lists I've seen. I had the Sonoma Mixed Grilled with filet mignon and also the shrimp tempura over an Asian style mixed vegetables, both were fantastic. The filet was cooked perfectly and the tempura had a nice taste to it, the veggies were full of flavor and probably my favorite part. I actually enjoyed the wine I had so much that when I returned home I had to find out where they ordered it from so I can have it shipped to my house. The next time I'm in Pittsburgh I will be stopping here."}
{"text":"If you like new American/Californian style cuisine, Sonoma Grille should be next on your list.  It's higher end, which makes it a very nice place for special occasions.   It sits a few blocks up from the Cultural District, just beside the Convention Center, so it's a great place to go if you've got an event in either of those places. Mostly, though, they just serve very high quality food, and they serve it well.  Seriously, the wait staff exceptionally friendly and professional, and quite patient in answering questions and making recommendations to indecisive diners.  I've been twice for lunch and once for dinner, and haven't been disappointed by a meal yet."}
{"text":"Nooooo! What has happened to our beloved Sonoma Grille and who hired the culinary students? 
Absolutely without a doubt the worst dinner and service I've ever had at a Pittsburgh resturant. Where should I start? The waitstaff? Oh my, Matt I believe was his name, and although he was pleasant to chat with he was MIA thru most of the meal, never removed the dirty appetizer ( tapas for two) dishes, and only became cordial when I complained about our cold dinners. And cold they were! Ugh. Unbelievable for a 40 minute wait for food. Also the female waiter that delivered our meals, first placed them in front of the couple at the table next to ours, then plopped them down in front of us without saying a word. I should have refused them right then, but after such a long ordeal to get bread and the appetizer, I didn't want to take a chance of not being served dinner till dawn!
I had the Pork Porchetti, which was over cooked and over salted. It was served with these 3 petite carrots that honest to Pete, were completely fibrous and hard as a rock. I can't explain what was in the mystery sauce underneath it all- maybe tomatoes, zucchini- one pearl onion and a toss of pine nuts. I ate one of the two medallions and offered the other one to my dinner partner. He took 1 bite and wouldn't eat it. Dry, hard and burnt. 
He had chosen the sea bass, which was merely fair. You really can't ruin plain fish can you? 
The manager did comp us for our 2 glasses of wine- the least he could do for a subpar meal costing $80 not including the wine & tip...
I understand the Sonoma has changed hands and is under new management. I wish them luck, and hope they find success hiring a new chef."}
{"text":"An utter disgrace. I took the effort to make a dinner reservation here, but was still forced to wait for more than 20 minutes. Meanwhile, a duo who were clearly friends with the manager (one of those faux hipsters with a beard and mustache from 2010) were whizzed through.

Decor screams Olive Garden and is drowned in tacky shades of tan. Furniture has seen better days, too. Service was adequate, though the small-talk was awkward. Food was okay -- the people raving ad nauseam about the food obviously have never been to a Big City restaurant.

I actually had to check to see if this was the venue I had seen on Yelp. It is, and the reviews here are stunningly off-mark. This establishment is poor, and management is in dire need of reform. It also remains to be seen how it has any remote connection to Sonoma. Even Paris, Pennsylvania, has more to do with France than this place has to do with California. What a joke.

NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Very busy but friendly bar staff. Pork was tasty, would of had the rib eye but they ran out 10 minutes before we got around to order. Bar mate had the lamb :reported it to be  excellant."}
{"text":"Had dinner outside here on one of the last beautiful summer-to-fall nights. Located in the cultural district, it was a nice place to sit & watch people go by. The wine list had enough to offer.  Food was good. I had their duck & it was cooked perfectly. The chocolate bar dessert did not disappoint. The service was great."}
{"text":"Talk about an amazing wine list! So much wine, we didn't look at the dinner menu.

The venue itself is large and inviting. The bar displays many of the wines they serve. You also have the option to sit outside if the weather is nice and you so desire.

The wine menu has bottles ranging from $20 to $2,900 if you're in the mood to waste a few paychecks.

The service was good here with frequent visits from the wait staff."}
{"text":"Terrible, overpriced, overly stuffy.  Some nice wine selection."}
{"text":"I dined out at Sonoma with a few work colleagues and we all had a great meal, and a nice dining experience. There were a few lows, but mostly highs!

Pro's:
Great wine list.  Nice atmosphere, a good bit of noise, but nothing out of the ordinary. 

The sweet and spicy salad was amazing.  I didn't notice it being spicy, but that didn't bother me in the least. The pistachios added a great crunch to the dish. 

The appetizer sampler was outstanding as well. Very well prepared and presented tapas, and it was more than enough for four (despite what the server recommended!). 

The Study of Pork was as creative as its name!  Unlike most fine dining dishes, this was an ample dish.  Pork Belly, Mimolette Grits, Quail Egg, Parma  Pancetta, Stout Braised Local Pork Butt, Sourdough French Toast, Bacon, Local Apples.  What's not to like?  And it won't leave you hungry. I would get that again, no question about it. 

Con's:
There was no wait to get seated, but it took a good 10+ minutes to get someone to stop by and check in with us. 

The server was very bubbly and friendly, but a bit too pushy for my liking. She probably assumed we were running a company tab, so she tried multiple times to add items to our bill...pita chips, an extra round of appetizers, trying to get us to pick a wine that was more expensive. She probably also assumed we wouldn't have the nerve to say no, but we did. I think being a helpful server to provide recommendations is one thing. To blatantly try run up a tab is another. 

Very nice decor. However, some of the tables are very close, so it almost feels like you're sitting with strangers."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there. The food was pretty good. The best part about the restaurant was the atmosphere, music and server. The server was exceptional and attentive. The music was great and I found myself singing to several songs."}
{"text":"We were so lucky to be staying in the hotel next to the restaurant. It made this restaurant to feel like home. Incredible happy hour, the service was great for the most part. The shared Topos appetizer was a great start to a delicious dinner. In my four days in Pittsburgh we went back three times!"}
{"text":"Hubs and I joined a friend at Sonoma Grille on a recent Friday evening. The weather was beautiful so the outdoor seating was full but inside was half empty. We were greated right away by our server who helped us pick out our drinks. We ordered the med plate while we waited for our dining companion. The med plate was quite interesting. A small plate of olives, hummus, beet \"dip\", and a quinoa salsa of sorts with pita bread. The olives didn't seem to fit in but we enjoyed them anyway. Hubs and I thoroughly enjoyed the quinoa with the chopped veggies. Yum. When our entire party had arrived, we ordered our entrees. I chose the sonoma salad to start and the mixed grill- one selection- grilled chicken with fettuccini with a tomato basil sauce. The salad came out promptly. I loved the added crisp and fresh taste of the julienne pear on top. The dijon dresing was light on the mustard and tasted more like an italian. Oh, I almost forgot. We were also given an amuse bouche of asparagus in an italian dressng which I passed on because I'm not an asparagus fan. The rest of the table enjoyed it. Our entrees arrived promptly. I wanted to make not of the prompt service due to previous reviews where wait time between courses was excessive. From my experience, Sonoma seems to have addressed this issue. 
My entree exemplified the basics done right. Grilled chicken breast was tender and juicy. Cooked to perfection. The pasta had to be homemade. If they don't make it at Sonoma, they must buy it from somewhere local that makes it. The perfect amount of sweet yet savory sauce covered the pasta. In addition to our entrees, our server brought out all of their sauces for us to try. We especially enjoyed the thai peanut sauce and the ginger glaze. Hubs and our friend both ordered the mixed grill two selections- the filet kabob and the ahi tuna. The loved both equally. Having had such an awesome meal, we couldn't pass up dessert. We decided to order the trio of minis. Mini is an appropriate word because each of the trio consisted of 2 small bites. Not enough for us to share so we each decided on one. I took the vanilla panna cotta with peach compote. All in all, the food was excellent, service as top notch and I hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"Fancy place that requires reservations. Suggest dressing up a bit. Great selection of wine that go up to as expensive as $2950. The waiters know their stuff. I was impressed with how huge this place was inside! We had a big party and the table was huge with a lot of space between chairs. So definitely does not feel cramped in there even though there were a lot of people on the night we went. Food is fair."}
{"text":"So yummy. We went on a Monday night, so it was very uncrowded, but the ambience was still very cool. The servers were very attentive, and my water glass was never unfilled for more than five minutes. The food was very good as well, and there were plenty of vegetarian options/variations available. All in all, a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I give this place a 2. Poor service. French onion soup gloppy mess. Salads drenched.  Extremely limited options for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Very good. Good tasting filet mignon, solid wine menu, excellent service and interesting dessert menu. Recommended!"}
{"text":"At first I didn't like the menu ( because I didn't see chicken on the menu) but decided to stay anyway.  My husband and I really liked the food and service.  I had a fettuccini seafood dish that was excellent.  My husband had the salmon. We also had a dinner salad. All of the food was excellent. 
The bread is outstanding! (Unfortunately)
Wished it wasn't so amazing. 
We did have one issue that was corrected beyond our satisfaction. 
I'm really glad I decided to stay."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great service. Louzy decor and the vibe is a bit on the snobby side... Extensive wine list and their deserts are always exceptional.  This is one my favorite spots in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Tapas flight and wine flight after a trip to Home and Garden Show. Fun way to share some wine and food."}
{"text":"Nice find in the Convention Center area of Pittsburgh.  The shrimp appetizer is very tasty and the main entrees are nicely presented and quite delectable."}
{"text":"It had been a while since I've been to Sonoma Grill but I suggested it as a place to meet some out of town friends for an early lunch. They wanted to meet somewhere at 11:00 in order to hit the road and Sonoma opens for lunch at 11:00. Notice I said \"opens\" and not serves. More on that in a bit. 

Every time I walk in here I think, wow, I really should come here more often. This really is a nice space! Great bar, very good wine list, nice atmosphere. Why don't I come here more often? Then I order the food and that question gets answered. This visit reinforced my opinion on the food. The lunch menu was presented as soon as we sat down and looked really good. All four of us made our choices and waited for our server which took a few minutes and placed our order. Then we waited. And waited. 40 minutes go by and we haven't seen her at all. Knowing my friends chose an early lunch for a reason, I started looking for her and finally got her attention. I asked her what was happening with our food and she went to check. I also noticed that two tables who came in before us didn't have their food either. This is 45 minutes. So let me just say service was pitiful. 

When the food did come it wasn't good. The \"bowl\" of curry chicken soup was pretty much a cup size and not particularly tasty. And it was barely lukewarm.  My soft shell crab Po Boy was a nicely sliced bun stuffed with lettuce, slaw and slathered in remoulade (read mayonnaise). I had a hard time finding more than a bite of soft shell crab in there. I didn't know a soft shell crab could provide multiple servings. It was NOT good. 

In summary, it's a good place to sit at the bar and have a drink. I don't recommend it for food. Or service. There are far better places nearby."}
{"text":"We were here on the Pittsburgh marathon weekend. Place was not crowded inside but the inefficiency of the wait staff to make tables available, made a huge crowd waiting outside. Half the menu was over/out, perhaps due to the demand on the marathon Sunday (can't they anticipate that and adjust the inventory?!).. Wait staff was so so. Good was not bad."}
{"text":"Not quite sure what happened these past few months. Perhaps new ownership? The service has been AWFUL!

For example, tonight (Friday) they offer \"free Tapas\" from 5:00-7:00 for happy hour. I got there at 5:40 and the tapas never came out! I guess there truly is no such thing as a free lunch.

Moreover, my girlfriend and I ordered dinner at 6:00. Our food did not come out until 7:30. The waitress apologized and comped our meals. It would have been more appreciated had the food she given us at 7:30 actually, you know, resembled anything we ordered. But, it didn't. 

This is the second time in a row the service there has been awful. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. This restaurant used to be one of the best. Now, I'm not so sure I'll ever be back. There are too many other options downtown now that seem to value their customers and that are able to accommodate a large crowd on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Marriott hotel next door and they recommended Sonoma so I went there for dinner.  I returned again for lunch the next day and then dinner again that night!  That's how much I enjoyed it.  Unique food combinations, great service, cool atmosphere and a reasonable price.  I will definitely return here the next time I am in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I meet up with one of my friends from college about once per month, and we go out to eat somewhere on his work lunch break.  One of our recent lunches took us to Sonoma Grille.  It's probably one of my favorite places we have ever gone.

The wait staff here is exceptionally friendly, and they want to help you find the perfect meal.  If you don't like chatty servers, this isn't your place.  However, our waiter was super helpful, and it was just his first day!  They must have some pretty fierce training.

I ordered the crabcake BLT.  Crabcake, sunny side up egg, tomato, coleslaw, and bacon on a sandwich.  YES, please!  It was delicious, though a bit messy.  So if you're trying to look graceful.... Who cares?  This sandwich is worth it!

I really loved the ambiance here as well.  Table cloths and cloth napkins for the win.  They also had a huge wine list if you don't have to go to work after your meal.  When I've gone past at night, this place gets crowded, especially after shows at the Benedum.  You might want to consider a reservation if possible.

I can't wait to return and test out more of this menu!"}
{"text":"Went in at 8pm for an 8 o'clock reservation.  20 minutes later....  We get a table.  They also don't clean their glasses.  They smell like some strange candy.  Weird residue on it.  Maybe some juice spilled onto it.  Smelled like pop rocks or something.  The restaurant is attached to a courtyard Marriott.  Not exactly sightly.   But the food is excellent.  Just atmosphere is tacky looks like a \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" gift shop.  Lots of great places in area that actually are upscale.  But the food is just as good at Sonoma."}
{"text":"We just returned here for our second visit on New Year's Eve (our first visit was a NYE a few years back), and I'm just as in love with the place as I was before.  Sure, it's a splurge (which is why we only end up here on New Year's Eve), but it's a worthy splurge.

This NYE, they had a prix fixe menu, in addition to a smaller-than-normal regular menu, but since we are samplers, we decided to each get the 5-course prix fixe so we could try as many things as possible.

I love that a trip to Sonoma Grille is not just dinner, it's an entire event.  Our waitress, Barb, was fantastic - knowledgeable about the menu, and passionate about it too.  They had just introduced some new items, so the servers had recently done their menu taste-test, and to hear her describe everything was like being there in the room as each dish was sampled and explained.

Sonoma Grille is regularly recognized as having one of the best wine selections in the city, and it's true.  The markup is a bit much, but again, you're paying for atmosphere and experience in addition to good California wines (I'd love to see a bit more Central Coast, as that's my favorite wine region, but the name is 'Sonoma,' so I give them a pass).  The staff can answer any question you have about the wine, which I really appreciate.

We started with the 'Trio of Amuse' appetizer, which had a parsnip bisque (light and flavorful), some oysters (which weird me out a bit, I must admit), and a teeny tiny beef carpaccio that was perfect in every way.  It was just one little nibble, but it was an insane burst of flavor.  While we were enjoying our wine and appetizer, the bread server came around with a selection of four different kinds of bread.  Instead of an individual table serving being brought to your table, a server comes with a large basket and serves you a few pieces of your choosing, plus olive oil for dipping.  I don't know why, but I love this little unique aspect of this restaurant.

For the larger appetizer (oh yes, two appetizers), we each got the jumbo lump crab and avocado plate.  This was gigantic - we could have easily split one between the two of us.  The crab pieces were huge, easily the size of garlic bulbs.  My only suggestion for this would be to have a few pieces of the crostini instead of just a little sliver at the bottom.  The actual plate was quite juicy, and the crunch of the crostini was a good balance.  Mmm, this was like crab guacamole, so in other words, amazing.

My husband and I each got different salads.  He opted for the fois gras salad (which he loved, even though I was a bit too squeamish to sample it), and I got what I shall refer to as the pile 'o beets.  Anyone who knows me knows my love affair with beets, and this was just perfect.  Slices of beets interspersed with goat cheese and well-seasoned... wish I could eat that every day.  Not very 'salad-y' but heavenly nonetheless.

There were five different options for entrees, but we both had our eye on only one thing: the filet mignon.  Oh. My. Word.  This steak was cooked to perfection - so tender and juicy that my mouth is watering just remembering it!  It came with garlicky whipped potatoes and broccolini (which I delicately pushed to the side - sorry broccoli, we're never going to be friends).  The portion was huge, and I had the second half wrapped up for lunch the next day.

We were nearly too full for dessert, but had to make room to try the chocolate ravioli.  It's a little weird, and the texture is a bit chewier than I would have thought, but the flavor was excellent.  It came with a nice blend of raspberry and vanilla sauce for dipping, and was perfect alongside a steaming cup of coffee.

All in all, we had another excellent experience.  Barb even offered to keep my leftovers in the fridge until after the midnight festivities, but I was afraid I'd forget in the massive crowd leaving downtown, so we walked it back to the car anyway.  I was not going to let myself miss out on a second meal of that filet in the aftermath of Pittsburgh fireworks lol.  This is one NYE tradition we plan on keeping for many years to come!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this is listed as a tapas restaurant.  I would say they have a few appetizers, but hard to classify it as a tapas restaurant.

I saw that it was 4 stars on YELP, so decided to give it a try.  The menu didn't excite me and was with a colleague who considers himself a big foodie, and he felt the same.  The waitress was pushing beets...beet soup, beet salad.  Not a big fan of beets though, so ordered the Mixed Grill.  You get a choice of 3-5 meats (I had filet skewers and ahi), served over pasta or mixed asian stir fry veggies (I chose the latter) and a choice of about half a dozen dipping sauces.  I must say that it was tasty, and if I went back, would order it again.  Mainly because nothing else on the menu really jumped out at me.

They do have a good wine selection, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Sonoma has a pleasant atmosphere and an amazing wine selection. The food was great. The service was a little slow. From what I could tell, the server had too many tables to really give good service. I think if more staff was on, it would have been a 5 star dinner."}
{"text":"So with the continuation of my food journeys in Pittsburgh, I found myself searching for a quick bite on a rainy night and found myself wandering over to Sonoma Grille. I saw some solid reviews and wanted to give this place a shot. The joint itself is on the bigger side with a large bar as well as a large dining area. There are drawings on the wall near the bar with of course tv's set up for people to watch various games. I'll be honest and say that each time I have walked in, I haven't seen a hostess standing at the podium but perhaps coincidence and really didn't matter to me since I just made my way over to the bar.

The bartenders have been friendly enough when engaged but will say they seem busy (which I appreciate) but in turn not always the most attentive. Perhaps they should consider hiring more people since the bartenders did seem genuinely busy but I digress. They have a decent liquor selection and I found myself of course perusing the various drinks and settled with Balvenie as my choice both times I was here. Within my two visits I have ordered the pork chops and the steak since on both occasions the Indonesian glazed duck was not available. I would say both of the dishes were OK for me. They were good but not sure if either were memorable for me to warrant a o.m.g. moment where I felt someone should make their way over to this joint. They cooked both dishes well but there was just that certain something that was missing to make it special.

All in all, a decent spot to hit up but I think there are a few other joints that would be at the top of my list instead."}
{"text":"I hover between 3 and 4 stars. The service was great, very patient with our rowdy 7-people group. The food was well-presented but only average in taste. Don't get the mixed grille unless you order multiple selections because with one selection I got 6 small bites of filet and a mountain of boring veggies like baby corn and celery. The filet was excellent but celery? I didn't pay $16 for celery! And the flourless chocolate torte was bland...definitely not as rich as expected."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh on a business trip and this place was right next to the hotel. The food was amazing and the wine choice was huge. Food was cook perfectly, the wine is great, and the service is amazing. Overall,  My business partners and I was very happy. The chocolate creme brulee desert was fantastic! Chocolate is always a good thing ;) overall fantastic!! I will definitely be back whenever I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"one star for ridiculously poor service. sat at an empty bar for nearly 10 min. the bartender and multiple waitresses walked past us and not one person said hello or asked for our order. we got up to leave, bartender didn't even look up.  I decided to say \"hello\" to try to get his attention and he passive aggressively replied \"have a good night.\" 
went across the street to Sienna Mercato and had great service and even better drinks. 
no wonder your bar and restaurant are empty when every other place on the block is packed."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, and had a nice time. They make more of an effort with vegetarian options than you might think, with a vegetarian, mushroom-based french onion soup and a main dish that centered around quinoa (yum). The service is also excellent and accommodating with great wine recommendations.

While I very much appreciate the veg options, I think there were some flaws in the actual execution. The french onion soup was cold when it got to me, and the gruyere on top had congealed. I'm too shy to send things back, and, even cold, it was still pretty tasty."}
{"text":"My husband and I ventured to Pittsburgh for my birthday weekend.  We have never been to this city (which is amazing by the way).  This restaurant happened to be near our hotel and we liked the menu, so in we went.  WOW!  We could not have picked a better place.  Our waitress Cindy was uber friendly and helpful.  Not only did she go through the menu and give recommendations but she also wrote down places we should visit while in Pittsburgh.  I started with the pear/beet/gorgonzola cheese salad which was wonderful.  My husband started with the seafood chowder and though he was disappointed that they ran out of bread bowls to serve it in, the girl who passed out bread gave him plenty for dipping. As for our entrees:  I chose the filet. It was the most tender filet I have ever had - and topped with the blue cheese and hearts of palm and the whipped mashed potatoes and broccalini (sp?) it was honestly a taste explosion in my mouth. My husband (a safe eater) chose a combo of chicken and filet.  I told him he shouldn't order chicken b/c I cook it all the time, but man, let me tell you, that was the most amazing chicken I have ever tasted!  Really.  His plate was served with stir fry veggies.  He is not much of a veggie eater but said, \"I have never been so excited to eat vegetables!  Even the veggies were amazing! We both agreed that this was one of the best meals we have had. Ever.Go there."}
{"text":"The food was really great here but the service was bad unfortunately. We waited a very long time for pretty much everything we ordered. I even had to get up to remind them of our drink order."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I would definitely go with their 'tasting' menu that they offer so you could try a few of their dishes. 

Although I have had some dishes there that I didn't like (the ravioli) I would have to say most of my meals here are divine!

The Osso Bucco is amazing. The veal.. so tender and juicy. The scallops, the lamb bruschetta, the crab tian.. all great.. you cant really go wrong here!

I would say that they need to spend more time focusing on the side vegetables that they serve with your meal (osso bucco, etc.) as they come out overcooked and bland most of the time... but nevertheless- absolutely delicious!

The veal is the best thing I've had there. I'd steer away from the duck and the ravioli."}
{"text":"This is a local favorite of mine that I visited for lunch.  I'd only ever had dinner there. 

Food was good, waiter was great, atmosphere was clean and warm and sort of. . . upscale casual.  My wife wanted someplace \"quaint\" to eat, but after visiting several quaint options. . . defaulted to an old standby.

Old standby is a slap in the face.  We love Sonoma.  So we visit it more than most other nice restaurants.  

Anyway, soft music playing in the background, a cold sauvignon blanc to compliment my vietnamese pork po-boy. . . it was a very nice lunch."}
{"text":"I love the Big Burrito Group but I must say that the Big Y is definitely close on their heels. Sonoma is right downtown and they offer valet parking . The place is lively and has a good feel when you walk in. They have an extensive wine list but for those who just want an inexpensive glass of wine can order cheap glasses or wine flights.

We went this past summer and I am kicking myself because as I review the menu now, I realize that they must have changed it. For an appetizer they offered an extensive tasting platter that had everything from cheese to meat to fish. It was absolutely delicious and when I went back I hoped to order it again - looks like I'm out of luck. I ordered the mixed grill which was okay - the pasta was somewhat lackluster but I took it home for leftovers and spiced it up myself. My friend swears by the duck and everything else that was ordered appeared to be enjoyed.  

A side note - when we arrived they asked if we were going to see a show and we told them no. I definitely did not want to be rushed out of the place but we were there for an extensive amount of time. Just be prepared for a longer wait if you are not seeing a show during the weekend."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Overall they have a nice environment and friendly wait staff. The bar area is large and inviting, but not too many beers on tap. The food was tasty, especially the salad. If you are in downtown Pitt this is a great place to enjoy dinner."}
{"text":"Appetizer was  MED Plate was okay, no thrills in my opinion, consisted of Flageolet Hummus, Local Bolton Feta and Cold Filtered Olive Oil Garnished with Hearts of Palm and Sun Dried Tomato, Quinoa Tabbouleh, Imported Olives, Grilled Pita

Next, Sonoma Salad  was made with Mesclun and Romaine, Local Pear Julienne, Tomato, Point Reyes Blue, Apple-Wood Smoked Bacon, Dijon Vinaigrette and was delicious.

For my entree, ORGANIC LOCH DOURT SALMON was my entree and it  consisted of Spicy Brussel Sprouts, Rutabaga Curry, Scallions, Cashews, Local Micro Greens. Very good indeed.

The one thing I must praise is Emily, she was my server and first class. I would hire her in a minute if she wanted to move to California.  Also, I was very, very happy to find this place late and they serve food until 11pm!  

Nothing overly disappointing, great service, great food, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great presentation, huge wine selection, service is outstanding. When my father ordered a speak and asked for A1. The waiter said they didn't carry it, ok m. No problem. He brought house sauce. Wasn't our favorite. So he literally ran across the street to another the restaurant (we watched from the window in awe) and brought back a new bottle of a1! 100000000 star props to the waiter! He went above and beyond our expectations!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is relaxed, lighting is subtle, staff is great, noise level is low so it's a great place for a romantic dinner or a spending time with friends. The wine menu has a large selection of domestic wines. The dinner menu has something for everyone. If you like duck, they have a fabulous dish with crispy, sweet glazed duck, sticky rice and a great selection of mixed veggies."}
{"text":"After 2 days of finding no edible food here it Pittsburgh, FINALLY stumbled upon this place. The crab bisque was great, fresh and had nice chunks of crab meat in it. I got the filet mignon for my entree, medium rare, cooked to perfection! If your in town and want a great glass of wine, food and awesome service, Sonoma is your place !"}
{"text":"This was my first time in Pitt. Although the food was good the service was very questionable. Curt responses. Some bartender was servicing everyone but us even though the restaurant was empty. Huh??? I don't get it."}
{"text":"I recommend Sonoma Grille without reservation.  I have, as of this review, eaten lunch there three times, and each time the food has been amazing, the prices have been extremely reasonable, the portions have been just right, the meals have come out fresh and staggeringly quickly, and the wait staff has been friendly and knowledgeable.  The decor is gorgeous, the tables are neither too close to nor too far from one another (there's plenty of seating away from the bar), and it really is, TARDIS-like, bigger on the inside.  

Now, normally, I like to recommend particular dishes.  I'll do that here, but understand that the Sonoma Grille menu changes with some frequency (it has done so once since the first time I ate there about six weeks ago).  If these things are still on the menu, I recommend the Pittsburgh Chopped Salad (so named, I believe, because of the crispy shoestring potatoes on top of it), the Amish Chicken Breast with fetuccine, the panko fried shrimp appetizer (which is what popcorn shrimp wants to be when it grows up - crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and spiced to perfection), and the sweet & spicy salad.  You can add a protein to any of the salads - for the PGH salad, I added salmon, and for the sweet & spicy one, I added chicken breast.  

Every time I've eaten there, I've been blown away.  And I haven't even checked out the wine menu yet!!"}
{"text":"This is where I did Darren's birthday dinner, and oh my was it amazing. Our server Julia was so awesome. To think we only came here because Seviche (Sonoma's sister restaurant across the street) was totally booked! 

Everything we had from the crabmeat avocado tian, arancini, and my pan seared diver scallops (which came with pork cheek, yum!) to the maple bacon butter bread and the gingerbread and chocolate hazelnut finale was well worth the price. Darren and I had a great time. 

Don't be put off by the ambience if you're a casual dresser. We asked and they had no problem with our informal attire or our unplanned arrival. They get the theater crowd, so it looks dressy when it really isn't. 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"I'm torn here... Sonoma was a steady favorite for us for a long time, but we're dealing with some inconsistency.

Things that are well-done? 
- Service.  The servers are exceptional.  They know the menu inside and out.  And they can recommend a wine with just a few tips from your party.  This has always been impressive.
- the Wine List.  We've never had a bad wine here.  And the list is extensive. 
- When the food is good, its very, very good.

Not bad, but hit-or-miss? 
- The food was good, but inconsistent. The duck last night was cooked perfectly and the flavors came together well;  just sweet enough and the rice cakes gave a perfect savory balance.  The bronzino a few months ago was tasteless and overcooked. The pork tenderloin last night was good, but not exceptional and the curried kale was odd.  The filet a few months ago was good. And whatever cheescake our wonderful server, Michael, gave us last night was amazing!

- Service.  While the servers are excellent, sometime it just takes forever for the food.

I wish we could get the consistency back!!  I'm not done with this yet, so let's hope we'll be back to good next time."}
{"text":"Fun restaurant with great service. Had Brussel sprouts, cracklins, and shrimp tempura as apps. They were good except the Brussel sprouts had sort of a burnt taste to them which I didn't really love. 

Main course had the house special which was Branzino prepared differently than the one listed on the menu. It was cooked perfectly and was really tender and flavorful. 

Desert was the chocolate creme brûlée which by itself would have been worth the trip. I could have eaten five of them. So much chocolate. 

Had a few cocktails off their menu too, and they were all great as well. Would definitely return. Staff was fast and knowledgeable, and the food was great."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - Check
Service - Check
Wine - expensive but really good selection
Beet and goat cheese salad, overdesigned (stacked like a Christmas tree) but tasty.
Chopped salad - Loved it!"}
{"text":"Great food! Ask for James, he's amazing and takes customer service to the next level. Everything from the salad to entree are amazing!"}
{"text":"\"What will you be having tonight, lady\"--my server.  Who says that?  Lady?  Ms., chick, dude, all work for me.  Lady? Not so much.

Make some room for me on the 'mixed feelings' bench.  I've eaten at this quasi-highly-recommended resto twice on my visits to the 'burgh.  I will admit that the half-price bottle of wine on Monday nights did me no wrong (you can take it to go if you don't finish it, which I shockingly did not do), but the food is not quite up to par.  The filet was delish-but not a special dish.  I expect a filet to be steaky goodness, and it was.  On the next trip, I had the gnocchi with pesto, snow peas, and wild mushroom.  These were definitely wild mushrooms.  How do I know? They were terribly gritty.  Were they washed?  It felt like I was eating a PBJ that I dropped on the beach.

The wine list is sooooper-heavy on California (natch, Sonoma and Napa) but the mark-up (for some of the more un-original choices) was steeeeeep.  

And the decor is a wee bit trite, with the fake windows and whatnot."}
{"text":"Ladies, brace yourself - Tuesday nights are considered ladies night and you get a free drinks (up to $8.00) and there are $5.00 apps.  So yes, that makes me a fan, b/c (1) I'm a lady and (2) I love free drinks - especially good drinks!

So for this fact alone, I'm going to stay that I'm a fan of Sonoma Grille.  I will mention that the $5.00 food portions are teeny tiny - they're more like mini tapas - so maybe that's not the best deal, but everything that I've had has been good.

I can't comment on dinner or lunch as I haven't been there for those meals, but for happy hour especially on Tuesdays - check it out!"}
{"text":"My family and I had recently eaten at Sonoma for brunch. The service was excellent and our waiter was professional. They had an impressive wine and beer list that was appealing to everyone at my table. I could certainly see myself dining here again."}
{"text":"This is a New York City food snob talking here. This place isn't just good in a \"I'm in a smaller city so I'll have to make do\" kind of way. This place is good by NYC standards. 

The menu is really interesting and the preparation is excellent. They have an impressive wine selection, too. The menu pairs dishes with wine, which is good for me; I'm a food snob but a wine ignoramus. 

Can you go wrong with a menu that has \"A Study of Duck\"? I liked it so much I came back a second night and the pork loin did not disappoint.

Editing this review to say: I came back to Pittsburgh for another trip and ate here every night. The food was even better than I remembered it. The spiced nova scotia salad was so incredibly delicious and well prepared, this place not only earned a fifth star from me, I now consider it one of my favorite restaurants in the country."}
{"text":"I recently visited here before a concert at Stage AE.  We were seated at a table with a booth on one side and chair on the other.  It annoyed me a bit that the tables are extra long, and that you seem a bit disconnected from the person sitting across from you. 

Nevertheless, besides that little annoyance, the service was excellent and the food was good.  FIrst I had the seasonal flatbread.  It came on literally, a cracker crust.  It had mushrooms and sweet and buttery walnuts.  It also had a little bit of cheese.  There really wasn't all that much flavor to the dish and therefore, I wouldn't recommend it.

Next, I ordered the seared ahi tuna, and because the steamed vegetables had bell peppers in them, I opted for the fettuccine in a tomato basil sauce.  I was very happy with my choice!  The pasta was excellent and the tuna was of excellent quality.  I really enjoyed the jalapeño and wasabi emulsion sauce that accompanied the tuna.

Overall, a great restaurant downtown.  And I will be sure to indulge myself with a bit of wine next time, as they have a great selection by the glass."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service (thank you Brook) and nice atmosphere. Will definitely dine again."}
{"text":"We were looking for a last minute dinner over Pitt family weekend.  First 3-4 options were booked and Sonoma could get us in almost right away(concerning at first). My daughter had the French Onion soup and said it was very good.  I asked if they would make the Ahi Tuna into a small appetizer.  They agreed and I received a couple chunks of \"OK\" tuna w a creamy wasabi dipping sauce.  Very middle of the road.  Our girls had the filet kabobs over fettuccine w tomato sauce.  Interesting combo but they liked it.  My oldest was craving some good mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately they told us they were out of mashed potatoes...really, one of the most basic sides...they were out.  My wife had the filet.  Nice cut, cut per request but nothing special.  I had the bacon wrapped veal medallions.  They were very good although very small.  Would have been even better over the truffle whipped potatoes, just didn't go as well with \"roasted\" fingerlings.  They were not roasted quite enough.  Good wine from st. Supery, Elu.
Overall not bad, just not great, but thought it had potential."}
{"text":"I came in for dinner and a drink during my Pittsburgh stay.  The bartenders were great, very friendly and knowledgeable.  The food (I got the tapas for two) was good, nothing great or spectacular though."}
{"text":"A dining partner and I ate here not too long ago and it was excellent. The decor was nice and they had quite an extensive wine list as was expected from a place claiming to be a Pittsburgh restaurant modeled after a West Coast kitchen and wine bar.
We started out with the tapas for two which consisted of 5 different appetizers that can be split among two people. The presentation of the dish was nice and it was a great way to sample a number of the chef's dishes. After that I had the chef's signature dish, the Crispy Indonesian Glazed Duck which was absolutely fantastic. My dining partner settled upon the salmon and crab cake from the Sonoma Mixed Grille and was also very satisfied with her selection.
When all was said and done it was a wonderful dining experience and I am sure that we will be back soon. The only thing that I did not enjoy was the amount of time between the appetizer and entree dishes. It was not an exorbitant amount of time, just a bit too long, but it was offset by both a manager and waitress apologizing without even having to comment."}
{"text":"Best lunch every!  Ordered the delicious portabello mushroom sandwich with fries.  Its was delicious and served on a nice baguette with cheese and spinach.  The place has a huge selection of wine and nice selection of food."}
{"text":"I visited Sonoma Grille for the first time 6 1/2 years ago while visiting Pittsburgh (also for the first time) and always affiliated this restaurant with fun memories of spending a long evening eating and drinking with my coworkers. 

When I secured tickets to the Nutcracker ballet before Christmas (thanks to Yelp!), I decided that Sonoma would be the perfect place to grab light appetizers with my hubby before the show started. The restaurant was pretty quiet when I arrived around 5:30pm on a Friday night, and I felt silly for making a reservation. I was also disappointed to learn that Sonoma's happy hour is only available at the bar, so my cocktail would cost $10.00 at our table instead of $5.00 at the bar. Oh well. I tried to console myself in my comfortable and luxurious armchair, reminding myself that a barstool would have had neither arms nor a back for my tired the-week-is-finally-over body.

Since we had post-show reservations at Butcher and the Rye, we decided to keep our pre-show snacks light and ordered the Chef's Tapas for Two. I love that the tapas are served on this ski / ramp / shot-ski looking wooden plank. I think all of the tapas were good or at least descent, but I would've personally amped-up the flavor in all five dishes. My favorite dish was the Coconut Shrimp, which was paired with a delectable cream sauce. I was most excited for the Crab Arancinis (which I learned from our waitress are fried rice and crab balls), and though tasty, I felt that the mixture could have used a bit more spice. The cured salmon and ravioli were both good bites but did not leave me dying for more. My least favorite item was the Pork Belly Steam Bun. The bun just tasted very low quality to me, like it was something that was picked up on the bread aisle at Giant Eagle.

Our waitress was very professional and courteous. Our tapas were eaten and our check brought over with plenty of time to spare for our 7pm show, which is always a relief to the don't-want-to-be-late-to-a-show type like me.

The food didn't blow my mind, but I did really enjoy my cocktail, the service, and that ridiculously comfy armchair. However, I'll probably check out the bar next time, especially during happy hour to obtain those great drink prices."}
{"text":"I had very high hopes as I sat at the bar and had read many reviews.  My challenge was that I arrived at 9:30 and ordered.  Generally, food should come out at anytime, from any kitchen with the same quality and attention to detail as it would at dinner rush.  Mine did not.  The lobster bisque had an excellent flavor and was prepared wonderfully - it just was not hot.  It was luke warm.  Disappointing.  For my meal, I had the recommendation from the bartender that was the duck.  Two nice breasts over a fresh bed of vegetables with cashews.  The breasts were also not hot, and was dry from invariably sitting around too long/reheated.

There are too many great restaurants in Pittsburgh for me to go back, but I know they serve good food(at least what other patrons have said), and I was forced to suffer through a meal when the kitchen staff was ready to go home.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly, professional service. according to the server, the menu concept is Californian... Which is quite accurate with the range of entree they offer. I have been here for dessert and coffee time, I was not disappointed with their creme brûlée neither."}
{"text":"Located in downtown Pittsburgh's cultural district, Sonoma Grille is an excellent choice when looking for a dining location. Having now been here numerous times, I've yet to have an experience that I wouldn't call anything less than good. On my most recent dining experience, my date and I were looking for dessert only. The dessert selection was quite vast, but we both chose a mini trio of desserts, which included a mini cheesecake, lava cake, and panna cotta. We paired our dessert with one of their many dessert wines. Service was good but we did run into an issue with the gift card. Apparently, they recently switched vendors and the balance was showing up as $0 when it actually was $50. The manager took a look online and verified the correct amount and gave us the remaining balance on a huge paper certificate. Sonoma Grille is under the same ownership of Perle (in Market Square). I'll add that we had the same issue with the same gift card at Perle, but they did not look online and, instead, we were forced to pay cash that night."}
{"text":"Sonoma Grille has been a staple in Pittsburgh's cultural district for a number of years. The location is convenient to all of the theaters along with the convention center. It does get busy on the weekend so I would not suggest trying to go without a reservation.

The food as Sonoma is a great testament as to why this establishment has stayed busy since it has been open. One staple is their Indonesian duck. Sticky and sweet and cooked perfectly, there is a reason why it is so popular. Another favorite is the Kurobuta tenderloin. The tenderloin is tasty but what is really important is that you order this so that you get to eat chorizo bread pudding. Yes...chorizo bread pudding. It's a lot more solid than the sweet version so think more about the bread part as opposed to the pudding. It may sound intimidating but it's just down right delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, excellent drinks and the avocado crab meat appetizer was beyond excellent. As a guacamole connoisseur , I challenged the chef and he killed it - best ever! Cocktails were great as well. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"*This review is for lunch*

I was at a conference in Pittsburgh last week, and I dined here for lunch not once but *twice* in the course of 4 days!  We liked it so much the first time that we went back.  If I had only been the first time, it would have been 5 stars, but the second experience was more like 3 stars overall, so I'm averaging.

The food is definitely of good quality and very fresh.  Both times my dishes were excellent.  The first day I had the Sonoma salad and the stir fry with the most delicious tempura shrimp I've ever had.  It was a salt and pepper type batter, but with some spice that I couldn't quite place...anyway, it was completely amazing.  And perfectly fried, not greasy, etc.  The shrimp were served over noodles and veggies.  Sadly, most of the veggies were actually celery, which almost doesn't count.  I dug around for the broccoli and zucchini which were hiding in there.  The noodles themselves were cooked well and had a good seasoning.  The Sonoma salad was amazing!  It was perfect: bacon, blue cheese, julienned pears, arugula...mmm.  I was very impressed.  So my food was a 4.5 that day.  Service seemed fine, although a little slow perhaps.

The second time we went, they were clearly having some staffing issues.  We got there during the lunchtime rush from all the various conferences that were happening at the Convention Center, so I can understand that it's a bit crazy.  But the hostess was SO RUDE.  She didn't even acknowledge my presence at the podium for several minutes and not until I said something.  I asked if we could put our name in and she said \"yes one minute ma'am\" which I figured meant that she was busy with something but would get to me next.  Nope!  She ignored me, called the next group to be seated, took them, got back, took another group and continued ignoring me.  That is just ridiculous!!  How long does it take to get my name put down on a sheet??  It would take you two seconds to be nice to me and then you wouldn't have a frustrated customer wondering if it was even possible to get seated.  Anyway, we gave up and sat at the bar since she was ignoring us.  Then, the bartender was so busy that it took her a good 15 minutes to come give us waters and take our orders.  By then, my friend had to go back to the conference so she wouldn't miss the next session!  So we had to box up her food when it came.  

We just felt bad for the poor bartender who obviously had way too many people for just her to wait on!  She even sort of griped to us that the hostess had been seating too many people and there weren't enough servers.  I know it's frustrating to wait, but it would be better for groups to wait to be seated until they could actually be served....anyway.  The restaurant clearly has some staffing issues that they need to work on.  And that girl at the front needs to lose the attitude!  The guy there the first day was perfectly friendly and another hostess we saw was also pleasant...it was just this one girl.  Grrr.

The food was just as good the second day, but I was so starving by the time it came that I wasn't as satisfied with the experience.  I had a different salad (can't remember what it was called) and I added filet mignon to it, which was deliciously tender and perfectly cooked as I had asked for it.  But the whole situation with the hostess had just soured the whole experience...nothing could really make up for it.

If I were ever in Pittsburgh again, I would definitely go back for the food, but if I saw that girl at the front, I'd go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Fabulous service, nice variety of menu items, we had 4 in our party.  Brussels sprouts and duck dishes are great!!

The Indonesian duck with crispy rice cakes was well seasoned"}
{"text":"First, be prepared to pull out a wad of cash for this one. It's not cheap, but good food seldom is. I can't say this is a five star, because the service is iffy, and it's actually connected to the Courtyard Marriott next door - so the selection has to cater to travellers as well as those with a more educated palate.

Alcohol selection is fair, with a nice wine menu and a fully stocked bar. Local brews including IPA beers are on tap, and served in what appears to be 8 oz glasses. So two are not a problem, until you see that they are priced at the usuall 12 oz price for only an 8 oz portion.

Selection is good, but again - the portion size is small. Very small. I don't like to gripe, but when I get a plate of moderately priced food - I like to be able to see it and not most of the plate. While prepared well, I can't say it leapt over my tastebuds either. I had the pork and fillet mignon mixed grill selection - but what I saw my friends get for $22 was absolutely too little for a \"prok specialty\" dish. Three small, two inch round medialions, 3/4\" thick is just not enough of a portion size. Even if you are on a scrict diet.

The decorations are nice, and it does make for a good impression if you are taking a dress model out to dinner. If you're taking a business collegue or a relative - you might want to think twice about going here. Good food, just not liking the portion size."}
{"text":"Can't rave enough about the  Sonoma grill.  What an important addition to the Sonoma square.  Friendly and personable staff and the owner, Nima, really makes you feel at home.  Talk about an upgrade from the previous establishment.  The food is well made and priced nicely."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  It has slipped a little over the years and I do miss the chef's surprise dinner, but I still rank it tops.

The place can get busy, but you are never rushed.  I love the atmosphere and of course the fine selection of wines, which everyone is more than eager to help you with.  Which for me is nice as I am in no way a wine expert.  Expect the proper wine to be paired with your meal.  Even desert!

The food is exceptional and the menu changes often with the seasons.  The chef does a very fine job keeping it new.  Anytime we are in the Theater District or if we just want to go downtown for a special evening, Sonoma Grille always is on the list of things to consider.  Just make reservations."}
{"text":"I gotta say, we were pretty impressed. Admittedly, any restaurant with a California location in the title always makes me a tad skeptical. But this time, success.

First of all, the place is huge. From the street you think that you are dining in an intimate, normal sized restuarant, but the ceiling are super high and the dining area is lofty and airy- but still romantic and intimate. We were seated right away and handed a wine list with a ton of Sonoma and Napa Valley wines. I stuck with water, but Pat ordered a BH Cohn Pinot Nior, which I have had before an loved. (great winery in Sonoma as well!!)

We split an entree of 3 meats- chicken, fish and steak. The tuna was delicate and well seasoned, the chicken nice and tender. Pat went to town on the steak. The portion size was perfect.

The place is a tad pricey, but the quality makes it worth it. I hear that it I smart to make a reservation-- I guess we got lucky. A very nice and knowledgable wait staff make the experience that much more lovely."}
{"text":"I cannot even begin to express how amazing my experience was.  I apologize I only got the names of the manager Bonnie and the patriotic Alex however the girl behind the bar and the guy with dreadlocks were just amazing.  Yes they were perfect on paper, they knew all the right things to say admit the wine and the food that isn't what impressed me so much.  It was their spirit.  I wanted to be their friend. They were such a great week oiled team I wanted to stream then and work for my company.  They made not only us feel special but also every single customer. I.have never been so moved by a stress my entire life.  So thank you so much got making my night perfect....I even liked the cheesecake and I hate cheesecake lol"}
{"text":"If my taste buds hosted a \"Best Pittsburgh Restaurant\" contest, Sonoma Grill would be the dark horse candidate all my teeth were talking about.  A relaxed but classy atmosphere, brilliantly fresh ingredients, a knowledgeable waitstaff, and thematic consistency across the menu, wine list, and environment combine to create a Californian retreat inexplicably located--of all places--in a Pittsburgh Courtyard Marriott.

From incredibly well executed standard items like a simple chicken sandwich to flashes of creativity like a shrimp tempura appetizer with a jalapeno-wasabi emulsion, the Sonoma Grill is great for lunch or dinner.  It's also one of the few restaurants in the city at this price point that I'd consider a bargain.  (The wine list is also impressive, with California front and center.)"}
{"text":"Overpriced, slow, and undercooked vegetables. The pasta was the only highlight. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Even though I had lived in Pittsburgh for the majority of my adult life, I had never visited Sonoma Grille until this past Friday while visiting my family in the Burgh for Thanksgiving. I believe the price tag was the main reason why I had never visited while living in town, but at the same time, new restaurants were always popping up left and right so Sonoma was never really on my radar. However, after the wonderful meal I enjoyed here, I only wish I would have visited while still living in the area so I could sample more items that truly caught my eye. 

We had no issue with making a reservation for 5 for Friday at 6:15. In fact, the majority of the restaurant was empty and remained so throughout our dining experience. Tip: use the valet. It's only $8 and it beats trying to find parking around that area. The atmosphere is pretty classy yet homey. They are definetly trying to recreate that countryside chic vibe. The murals on some of the walls seem more Italian countryside than Sonoma wine country but they are still beautiful to glance at while dining.

Our server, Lisa, was very efficient and friendly providing multiple suggestions- particularly with our wine and then entree sauces- that proved to be excellent recommendations. We started off with a nice bottle of red, a Syrah I believe. Very bold, not overly dry, slightly fruity. It complemented our meals appropriately. The bread basket is wonderful with several different varieties available and the butter is herbed which is a flavorful touch. We had a later lunch so, unfortunately, we didn't feel up to tackling both apps and entrees but, it is worth noting that the apps looked quite delicious. The tapas for two is a unique concept where you get a little bit of all the apps they offer, 5 total. The cured salmon with fennel yogurt, along with the  sweet crab arancinis, stood out to me the most. While Lisa did recommend the lamb shank or the diver scallops and raviolis, I chose to do the mixed grill option. This is a nice tasting option where you can choose either one, two, or three \"center of the plate\" options, one side, and one sauce per \"center of the plate\" option. She recommended two options for more of a \"full size entree\" meal. Options were grilled salmon, seared trout, coconut shrimp, tempura fried shrimp, filet and mushroom kabob, Indonesian glazed tofu or duck, or chicken breast. Side options were fettuccine with tomato basil sauce, garlic mashed potatoes, or stir fry vegetables. Sauce options included  minted cucumber yogurt, white truffle wasabi, sweet chili, tamarind ginger, spicy saffron aioli, or Chardonnay hot sauce. I opted for the filet and mushroom kabob, prepared medium rare, and the glazed duck as my center plates. Lisa recommended the white truffle wasabi for the filet and the sweet chili for the duck. I chose the stir fry vegetables as my side. The filet was cooked perfectly! It melted in my mouth and, although it tasted excellent on its own, the white truffle wasabi was the perfect complementary sauce. It had a nice kick to it And the truffle taste was easily apparent. The duck was amazing! The skin was perfectly crisp and the meat was tender. The sweet chili sauce was an amazing complement to the Indonesian glaze on the duck leg. The vegetables were stir fried in an Asian sauce and served under the main proteins. I really enjoyed the added Asian flavoring with both the filet and duck. Everyone in my party chose the mixed grill and everyone was immensely happy with their choices! I'd highly urge anyone who has yet to visit Sonoma Grille to make it your next special occasion dinner! It's very much worth the price tag!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch with my Mom, when we were both attending a conference on bipolar disorder at the Westin down the street.  I think the restaurant did not expect a whole bunch of conference attendees to randomly crash their lunch hour.  Service was slow, but our server was basically like \"sorry, all these people came at once, I had no idea, we're doing the best we can.\"  I believe him.  I doubt their lunch service is normally bad or slow at all.  We had a lovely table on the sidewalk, in the shade, so I was happy to wait a little while.  He also brought the check out with our entrees, since he knew we were in a hurry, so that was helpful.

I had the fish tacos, which I really enjoyed.  I was offered a side of \"fries or fruit\" and I picked fruit, which was the usual fruit-cup assortment of melons, pineapple, and grapes.  It was tasty and fresh but I would've liked more - like if you'd get a whole plateful of fries, can't you get a plateful of fruit?  But the tacos were really good - \"fresh seasonal fish\" as written on the menu - it was salmon and some tasty white fish on this occasion - with slaw, crema, and pico de gallo.  Most of the ingredients were locally sourced, according to the menu, and you could taste the freshness.  Big ups to the handmade tortillas - I suspect Reyna's made them - they were fantastic.  They did come with this really weird side of undressed greens -  maybe they were supposed to go in the tacos? - but there were a ton of them and I had no idea what to do with them.  Server brought me a little bowl of vinaigrette, at my request, so then they were turned into a nice salad.

Great happy hour, and fresh, well-executed food.  Great people watching too!  Lunch prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar on a VERY busy Friday night (Billy Joel+anthrocon+4th of July weekend!). Taylor was very friendly but definitely rushed. I don't think they anticipated being that busy at all. It was a beautiful evening, Chardonnay was crisp and delicious. Chris missed the marinated cherries that they used to add to manhattans, but said his drink and subsequent beer were great. They were out of Angels envy when we visited though.
A not on the bar and bartenders, it is like dinner and a show! They really take pride in their hand crafted cocktails, and it's something to watch for sure!
We had the 1/2 cheese plate, fried beer battered pickled veggies, and fried avocado. All three were fantastic, but my favorite was the pickled, fried veggies! Awesomely crispy with fantastic vinegary flavor, went perfectly with the wasabi mayo!
I really enjoy Sonoma grill, it may be one of my favorites downtown! And I love that they offer some outdoor seating! A great place to people watch on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I've been here probably a dozen times and for whatever reason slipped my mind to write a review. Until this weekend.. We stopped by for a couple drinks and some appetizers. Our waiter was seriously the rudest waiter I've ever had. I'm sure he was having a bad day but that's not an excuse.

So if it wasn't for this experience I would have given it 5 stars. The food here has been excellent every time and we've eaten many things on the menu. The wait staff in general is usually over the top on point. So I would highly recommend eating here especially for a special night out."}
{"text":"Walked in here since it was right next to my hotel.

The appetizer selection is upscale but not very, well, appetizing. The burger I went for was fine, and the bun looked artisan but tasted bland. The highlight if my meal was the cocktail menu, which, unlike the entree, lived up to the price point. Even then though, the drink was somewhat weak.

Overall the place is fine, the ambiance outpacing the food, but is much too expensive for an eatery in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place was really close to my hotel and in this part of Pittsburgh, it's slim pickins for late night snacks and drinks.  In fact, this was the only place still serving food past 10pm-although we had to hurry as they stopped at 11pm.  My friend and I decided to split the tapas platter for $22.  What came out was two tiny pieces of chicken for the satay, two miniature 'hot-pocket' type crab wontons, nickel-sized 'short ribs' and a microscopic lump of ahi tuna tartare.  I could get these items in BULK at Trader Joe's for HALF that price.  I've dined here in the past and the meals were always good and substantial so a word to the wise:  if you think this is one of those establishments where you get such large apps that you could order one as a makeshift meal, then you will be poor AND hungry!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times for dinner and have always enjoyed it.  They have an extensive wine list.  They pride themselves on being organic.  They are attached to the Courtyard by Marriott hotel.  I usually order the \"pick 2 or 3\".  I have enjoyed the lamb, steak medallions, ahi tuna and salmon.  I usually pick the Asian Vegetables. The salads are enjoyable too.  It is usually crowded but service generally has been OK."}
{"text":"Awesome meal.    We had James as our waiter, very knowledgeable, his suggestion were spot on.  Try the pumpkin roll bread pudding!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow the scallops were to die for!!!! The Sonoma salad was not too shabby either... Pittsburgh, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"So, by far the favorite place I dined in Pittsburgh.  Yes, they do have a great wine list, so order a bottle.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable on both wines, and buc's info.  Let's talk food.  Sonoma looks for locally grown fruits, veggies, and meat.  My meal was just fantastic.  Filet mignon, cooked to perfection, yum.  Also, appetizers are highly recommended.  Cheif sent out some tempura eggplant which was fantastic (I thought I did not like eggplant).  I order goat cheese, which had spicy jalepeno's.  What a great combo.  My friends had the tapa sampler, and were raving about it.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"SETTING
Fancy and dressy. Dim lighting. Large venue with plenty of seating. Sonoma is a region in California, and the decor does not really reflect that. There is a bit of a European vibe with the flower pots, wall art, and pictures, so I was a bit confused what the theme is really, if there even is one. 

FOOD 
Tapas: Pork Belly BLT. I loved how it was not too much fat, but a good ratio of a thick pork meat to pork belly fat. Underneath the pork belly was some pickled lettuce and sauce. Had an asian fusion type of taste. Highly recommend it to share among two people.

Entrees: 1) Field & Stream--a venison (deer) dish. We ordered medium rare, but the meat was tough enough that it tasted like it was medium well. The smoked trout mousse had a little too strong of a taste and did not really compliment the deer meat. It was a bit too overpowering each time I had a bite of the trout mousse. On the other hand, the fennel salad and asparagus were a bit underwhelming and did not add much to the dish. Overall it was okay, but I probably wouldn't order it again

2) Crispy Indonesian Glazed Duck. I love duck and this dish did not disappoint! It had an asian fusion vibe similar to how the Pork Belly BLT was put together. There was a lot (*fist pump*) of duck meat. The meat was glazed with a light sauce that had a hint of sweetness. Plenty of stir fried vegetables accompanied the healthy serving of meat very well. The rice cakes underneath the meat was pretty much crunchy fried rice. It was delicious! I highly recommend this entree :)

Dessert: Chocolate Creme Brulee. Creme Brulee is one of my favorite desserts, and Sonoma did a terrific job with their version. A heads up, it is NOT custardy at all. Underneath that sugared top later is a rich dark chocolate mousse (in place of the custard). Above the sugared coating was malt chocolate ice cream and a square of toffee. So. Much. Chocolate! I felt like I was getting a cavity from the richness. It was so good! 

SERVICE
Excellent and thorough. Hats off to Alan, our server for the night. He was very polite and accommodating. He asked us if we were catching a show later that evening (first time seeing \"Carmen\"!) and told us he would make sure we had enough time to eat and make the show without rushing. Very kind gesture. Since this was our first time at Sonoma, we asked him for suggestions. He gave us a quick yet detailed run-down of the menu and his favorites. From the tapas to the entrees to the dessert, he recommended the right dishes (aside from the venison), and we were so glad we listened! Thanks, Alan!

IMPRESSION
Pretty good food with above average sized servings. No complaints there (you know me)! I would definitely get the pork belly BLT, duck, and creme brulee if I come back again. Service was terrific and prompt. Overall, we had a great time. Made it to Carmen with more than enough time to spare!"}
{"text":"Since I have only been here for happy hour this is solely what my review is based on. I didn't try a full meal so I can only speak of their booze and appetizers.

Speaking of booze and appetizers, can we talk about how much I love this place? I consider myself to be a penny pincher when it comes to dining so I will say it probably was a little more than I wanted to spend, but honestly I feel that it was worth it. Before I go into the caloric portion I really like the vibe and layout of the entire place. It has this mixed wine bar slash watery feel to it. It feels very comfortable when you're in there.

I ordered one sangria after another because they were so good. Easily one of the best I've had. I was essentially using my fork to pick out the enormous hunks of fruit. I figured if I filled up on fruit maybe I'd spend a little less on food? Probably not...

Anyhow I believe their marketing team says they have the best happy hour in the city or they've been voted that. I'm not 100% and although I'm not sure I COMPLETELY agree I will say I loved it. They had $5 tapas style foods which they offer. I'm not going to recommend any of them to you because you need to try them all. I was getting a little upset because they were gone so quickly. They need like extra large tapas or something.

This is a great date place. Great happy hour spot if you want something a little more upscale than a dive bar. what's nice is they do have beer specials during happy hour so you don't have to have a taste for wine just to be there.

Even though it's like 15 degrees right now I'm totally wishing I had a glass of sangria right now."}
{"text":"This review is based soley from my happy hour experience there, not a dining experience.

A friend and I went a few Friday's ago to try them out for happy hour. I was excited about the specials ($5 cocktails, $4 glasses of wine, $5 tapas), especially for a fancy place like this in the heart of the cultural district. 

Let me tell you: the pear sangria was life changing. The atmosphere was elegant, and the place is beautifully decorated. The staff was very friendly, upbeat, and knowledgable about all aspects of the menu. The bartenders had a good rapor with their regulars while also being warm and inviting to newcomers, which is always a plus in my book.

One thing that took me by surprise is that it wasn't more crowded. When we left around 6:30 the restaurant maybe had 8-10 tables sat, and there was plenty of empty spots at the bar. For me that's not a bad thing--I don't like to be standing shoulder to shoulder with 40 year old brogrammers talking their heads off about the latest Pirates game--but I'm concerned that this place won't be around too much longer if there isn't a steady flow of patronage. 

Either way, this place is added to my list of favorite deal spots."}
{"text":"A very good place to eat at the bar if you are traveling on business by yourself.  With the TVs, wine options, local craft beers, its a comfortable place to have a solo dinner.  You will find yourself in the company of many business travelers.  It's cool."}
{"text":"Good golly I wish I had a better impression this time....not so much.  The wait staff is still upbeat and professional - great at selling!  Well, that's it for the positive.

The food, well...I ordered the fish tacos - tuna, please.  I got salmon instead....farm-raised, no less.  Ick.  I didn't say anything (my bad) because I didn't want to hold up the group.  The corn tortillas were so oil-laden that it dripped off the bottoms and onto the plate...watch out shirt!  The crema was simply thin sour cream, no cilantro, just a sprinkling of coleslaw mix and cubes of the foresaid salmon instead of the ordered tuna.  Came with a side of fruit which must have been left over trom the Sunday brunch...it was old.

They're still dishing out the bread like it was gold - one piece each....and don't look for the \"bread guy\" now the waiter hands it out judiciously.  The herbed oil needed to be shaken to dislodge the clump of herbs in the bottom of the bottle so all the poured out was herbless oil.  

My dining companions ordered the steak salad and pronounced them adequate, but longed for the hanger steak salads across the street at Nine on Nine.  I, too, longed for the fish tacos across the street at Nine on Nine.  From now on, Nine on Nine will be the destination....just keep walking by Sonoma Grille.  What a shame."}
{"text":"The crispy duck was outstanding, service was perfect. Our waiter offered suggestions when we asked and his recommendations were right on each time. The vanilla bean cheesecake was simply awesome."}
{"text":"We scheduled an early dinner at Sonoma Grill before Alton Brown's show at the Benedum, and though we chose the location purely for its convenience, the rave reviews had me very excited about the opportunities ahead. We were celebrating our anniversary and they brought us free champagne (this seems to be a theme with my reviews of late!). We started off with a customized wine flight and the tapas sampler, and though we were slightly disappointed that they were out of some items, the substitutions were delicious (the onion cannelloni were particularly standout). Apparently the menu is about to change at the beginning of March, so that's why they were running out. 

Our gregarious server (James, I believe) extolled the virtues of the duck, so we settled on that to share for our main as the tapas platter had been more than generous, and it was a pretty early dinner for us. Unfortunately he was back not 15 minutes later to tell us that they were out of duck, so we decided to try the \"Study of Hog\" as that will be disappearing from the menu. They split-plated the entree at no charge to us, and the courses were luxuriously spaced (we weren't in a hurry). Our server returned to offer us dessert, and by then we had been there close to two hours. We explained that we were headed to an 8pm show, and he assured us that everything could be brought out within 10 minutes (no souffles on this menu!).

We opted for the banana bread pudding with bacon and peanut butter and jelly, and the bacon was delightfully crispy and salty. The bread pudding below was a bit dry and not particularly inspiring, but the rest of the meal had been delicious. Our server brought over the check and explained that due to the substitutions, they were going to comp the tapas platter because it had caused us to have the same preparation of pork belly twice. Now, we love pork belly, and didn't particularly mind, but the gesture was very kind and took away a sizable portion of the bill. Amusingly, we heard him telling the table next to us that they were now out of the hog.

The service was nearly the best I've had in Pittsburgh, and I will definitely return once they're in full swing with a new menu. The lack of timely communication between the kitchen and waitstaff was a bit frustrating, but I would chalk that up to the transition."}
{"text":"My family went to Sonoma Grill for brunch expecting a good meal since we love Seviche and NOLA and have heard good things about Sonoma. We were very disappointed by the food we were served. For the most part, the food tasted good. However, my mother ordered lamb which was flattened and about 1/3 the size of my palm, and was tough and chewy. I wasn't expecting large portions by any means, but for the price we paid and what we were served, I will not be coming back. The service and atmosphere were great, but I hope my experience is not one commonly encountered by other customers."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and start with the Avocado and Crab Meat Tian. It's basically dressed up guacamole with crab meat and is incredibly light and refreshing. It's enough for two so split it before your meal. As an entree I ordered the pot roast ravoli and it was amazing. The roast really was croc-pot tender inside of four huge ravioli pieces in a tomato sauce. I could eat that 6 days a week and twice on Sunday. 

I chose to sit outside, but the place is roomy with ample bar seating. The wait staff is great too. I probably had someone check on me every 6 minutes, and my waitress picked a great pinot grigio to go along with my dinner. 

If you are visiting the area take your wallet. The menu is not insanely expensive, but most entrees are above $20."}
{"text":"AMAZING. The tapas were recommended to us by the bartender with dreadlocks (Eric) and all of them were delicious. He was super friendly and even ordered us the pork belly blt tapa on his tab because he \"stood behind them\". They were as delicious as he described. Jamaal and Ashley, the other bartenders, were also extremely nice. We would highly recommend this place. The only \"negative\" thing we have to say is that we thought the manager was inappropriate when she openly reprimanded Eric for smoking \"too many wood chips\" on my boyfriends manhattan drink he ordered (which was absolutely amazing)- we are paying customers and didn't think it was appropriate. Otherwise, GO HERE!"}
{"text":"I really, really want to like this place because it is one of my boyfriend's favorite spots in downtown Pittsburgh, but ... I really, really don't like this place.

The restaurant is a lot bigger than it appears from the outside with plenty of seating table wise. I hate how close the tables are to the bar, though. It doesn't seem to leave enough room when this place is busy, like during the gallery crawls.

Everything I've eaten here I've always found to be sort of blah, as if there is something more that they could've done to it. It always varies, too - maybe more spice, a bit overcooked, etc. etc. The last time I visited my boyfriend ordered lo mein and vegetable stir fry with chicken and I got the lamb pot roast sandwich. Thank God the sandwich came open faced with mashed potatoes because the lamb was dry, dry, dry. The stir fry was cold as if it had been prepared and then left sitting for a length of time. Overall, it was a disappointing lunch.

The only saving grace of this place, if you are a wine aficionado, is their extensive wine collection. It's huge and I have sampled quite a few of them. My boyfriend knows more about wine than I do and he always picks out something tasty. Sometimes we'll grab a bottle and just order some appetizers to munch on (the appetizers aren't anything special, either; shocking, I know). 

If you're downtown for an event and would like to grab a couple of glasses of wine, I definitely recommend Sonoma Grille over any other place downtown. If you're coming for the food ... eh, good luck."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go before a show downtown. Their cocktails are creative and smooth, the wine list is endless, and you have a 4 or 5 course meal in an unpretentious environment. Happy Hour has some great deals $5 tapas for some gourmet snacks and drink specials"}
{"text":"I love this place, I have to travel to Pittsburgh 5-6 times per year for work. I always stop at Sonoma when I'm here. The glazed Indonesian duck is amazing and the main reason I am giving 5 stars. It's awesome, I've had other dishes (I tried some of their fish dishes) all good especially if you get the pick two or three. But any time I have gotten anything but the duck I'm disappointed. It's that good.

Great selection of wines (pricy compared to what you would pay if you bought them from liqueur or fine wine store. But the staff is very knowledgable and fun, I've been here probably 20 times and have enjoyed each time.

The crab bisque is fantastic the sampler (if you have enough people) is really good too. I've heard the steaks are average but I have never tried them so I can't say. Overall I love this place, great drinks, great staff and great food."}
{"text":"My parents love this place and have raved about it for a while.  While visiting the 'burgh, I was feeling adventurous and we decided to head to the Sonoma Grille for dinner.  

As soon as we sat down, the first thing my parents noticed was that the menu (which they were so very much in love with) had completely changed....cue in the \"OMG WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO/EAT\" moment...Our waitress, Barb, immediately noticed the shocked faces of my parents and calmly confirmed that yes, the menu had indeed changed.  Sonoma Grille was now serving only local and fresh and organic food.  I felt like Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz and wanted to say, \"I'm not in Pittsburgh anymore.\"  Since when is Pittsburgh into sustainable, local, and organic food?  If I wanted that I would've stayed in San Francisco for the weekend....anyway...

The food was pretty good & I am a plain eater who appreciates the simple things in life...as such, the mixed grill with 2 options is a great bet.  I'd suggest the filet and the crab cake and the veggies (ask for no soy sauce on the veggies that come with your meal, I hear they're salty).

All in all, I think I would've liked this place equally as much if it weren't so into the fresh and local and organic schtick; however, I would definitely go back and they have a fantastically large/delicious wine list!"}
{"text":"I really have mixed feelings about this place.  Named Sonoma Grille located in the middle of downtown Pittsburgh?  It's somewhat clever I have to admit.  I liked the place, but wasn't overwhelmed with joy.

The wine list is pretty good, it could use a little tweaking and the prices are way overpriced.  I've had many of the wines on the list and payed far less for what they are here.  The decor is a little above average, but  somewhat outdated.  A little renovation could go a long way for this place.  I think the coolest thing was the mural on the wall with the quote,\"A meal without wine is like a day without sunshine.\"

If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh I may or may not come back.  Definitely won't be near the top of my list."}
{"text":"My fiance made reservations here for our anniversary.  The food was excellent.   I had crab stuffed raviolis.  He had a dinner special raviolis.  We both loved them!  The portions are not huge but it is what you would expect at a resteraunt of this class.  
The bread and butter before dinner was our favorite part.  We had 2 loaves.  After dinner, we ordered the sticky buns dessert.  (We had to try it after hearing they have their own pastry chef) The sticky buns were awesome. However, we would not order this again since the portion was tiny and the price was rather high.  

Overall we would return.  We booth agreed next time we need to try the mixed grill option, where you may pick your meat, fish, side and sauce."}
{"text":"Finally made it here.  I came for the Sunday Jazz brunch and I was extremely pleased.  They have a Prix fixe brunch for $23.00 which is totally worth it.  You get 2 menu choices and coffee or mimosa/bloody mary.  I was expecting a lot from this place reading the reviews and I was not disappointed.  I ordered the Crab Tian which is lump crab meat with avocado, onion, chili oil on a crisp.  It was delicious and was very filling.  Next I received my Brunch Burger that is Wagyu beef with panchetta and I did opt for the fried egg (which I highly recommend)  I asked for mid rare, and it came to me in all its juicy perfection.  I set aside the \"bloody mary ketchup\" as I did not want to amuse this creation.  I WAS IN HEAVEN.  I do not rave about burgers much but this one was just about as perfect as one can get and it was big .... by the time I ate my 2 plates, I was stuffed.  I did not get the fries with the burger, I opted for fruit instead and I am glad I did because I could not eat anymore.  

This brunch is priced fairly, for what you get.  Is it pricey ??, well .. perhaps, but the food is outstanding and I am always willing to pay a few extra dollars for quality and service.

Speaking of service; I arrived to brunch around 11:15 and it was quite empty.  I was seated immediately and my waitress came over in about 3-5 minutes.  I noticed as brunch went on, the more people seated extended the table wait times.  In saying that, I also observed that all of the staff took on all wait tasks to keep things moving, even the manager was serving food.  
In addition; the manager came over to my table a few times to make sure everything was ok.
I am giving Sonoma 5 stars because the food was amazing and the service was great.  OH and the Jazz during brunch was delightful."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Perhaps we were the wrong audience as we actually have been to Sonoma. We were staying next door at the Marriott and looking for a restaurant that had less heavy entrees and more healthy options and the menu and decor seemed inviting. The salads were fine, one had unusual ingredients, but the other just basic packaged greens. However the entrees were disappointing. Grilled fish on stir fried vegetables seems hard to damage, but these stir fried vegetables were floating in a sweet sauce and the 4 oz portion of sea bass was just a tiny end. It is rare that I leave a restaurant hungry but I did. What was troubling was one of the wines (ordered by the glas) had been stored improperly and tasted old. It is far less active than the other restaurants on the block, perhaps for a reason."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the bar service. Because I requested a mild version of their Bloody Mary, thru water downed the mix. Couldn't drink it. Ordered vodka with 7up. Sierra mist instead...horrible. Tastes like soda water."}
{"text":"Our experience with Sonoma was unacceptable from beginning to end. We arrived at 7:30 for our 7:30 reservation and we were finally seated 20 minutes later. Waited another 20 minutes for our waiter who never greeted us or even asked if we wanted water or a cocktail. He then announced he was going to take our order with the table next to us. After an hour our salad and soup arrived but we had to tackle another waiter to get a spoon for the soup.! At some point he came and removed our bread plates and then asked us to reorder our entrees. Totally abominable experience."}
{"text":"Horrible visit to Sonoma Rest. In Pittsburgh. on Saturday eve. 11/26/16. Sat for 1 hour before our meal came and then it was cold and tough.  The table next to us had the same issue except they had their appetizer, main and dessert before our meal came. They had constant attention and a visit from management. We got nothing but an apology from our waiter. I WILL NOT GO BACK!!"}
{"text":"I am very sad to report that our service was poor for Sunday brunch. We waited over 45 minutes for a meal that was eaten in about 15 minutes, as it was a simple order. The restaurant was fairly empty, so crowds were not the issue that affected service. The food was very good, and I would go back again in hopes of better service."}
{"text":"When my brother, who was visiting from out of town, and I were downtown on a Saturday, he suggested going to Sonoma Grille for lunch.  I balked at first--I was dressed casually and had heard that this was a fancy place--but he insisted.  I'm glad that he did.

Our server was very pleasant, knowledgeable and professional, and offered a few suggestions of dishes to order.  On her recommendation, I tried the vegetarian French onion soup.  It was a bit too salty, but as a vegetarian, I appreciated being able to have French onion soup for once--most places use beef broth.  I tried my brother's beet salad, which was delicious.

While it's true that Sonoma doesn't offer a bread basket, I think it's better this way.  You don't go to a restaurant to fill up on bread.  The bread that you do get (you get your choice of two) is delicious.  I enjoyed a slice of the ciabatta and a slice of the raisin walnut.  The herbs really come through nicely in the infused oil served with the bread.

As my entree, I had the grilled vegetable gyro, with a side of fruit (the other option was fries).  The vegetables in the gyro were very fresh, and I liked that the flatbread was grilled, too.  My one suggestion would be either to provide a larger size flatbread, or a second flatbread, because there was more filling than flatbread.  The fruit was blah--the melon and grape mix you see at cafeterias--not quite the quality you expect from a \"farm to table\" restaurant.

For dessert, we shared the ice cream sandwich trio.  One sandwich was made from gingersnap cookies with coffee ice cream, another was shortbread with chocolate ice cream, and the third was snickerdoodle with pumpkin ice cream.  Happiness.

If you put quantity over quality when it comes to food, Sonoma's probably not the best bet for you; the portions are reasonable but not oversized.  If it's quality you're after, however, you'll be happy here."}
{"text":"Let say the service was exceptional and the wine list was great BUT the food was terrible. The duck was really gamey and not as described. The French onion soup was room temperature when it came out, we sent it back and after 10 minutes it's was maybe 3 degrees warmer. Needless to say when we left the buzz from the wine was intense because our belly's were empty."}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner at the Sonoma Grill before a show last night.
  
First a couple of notes:  1) this is an upscale establishment, but casual attire is fine and the place is very comfortable and welcoming.  2)  Ever go to a restaurant and every delivery from the bar or kitchen results in conversations ceasing so that you can juggle contents of the tabletop to accommodate everything?  Not here.  Love that. 

Now for the taste bud party:  Pear Sangria.  Nice and light and a great intro to the tapas appetizer:  two of each:  scallops (good), shrimp (nothing special), pot stickers / croquettes / pork belly w/tamarind sauce (all fantastic).  We each had a different main course.  I had the Crispy Indonesian Glazed Duck.  It was spectacular and a really large portion - enough to share, served over risotto cakes with mixed grilled veggies.  Hubby had the Mixed Grill and chose the kabob and mango crab cake.  He loved it and could barely finish his meal.  Veal Saltimboca was a lovely presentation, the gnudi was the draw for our gnocchi lover and report was that it was very good.  Study of Hog was the fourth meal.  Notable:  one of the 'studies' was served with pepper spatzle and topped with a quail egg.

We had to decline desert - hard to do considering they had a RumChata something-or-other.

Our server was Cindy and, although they were very busy, she tended to us as though we were guests in her home - engaging and offering information and tips on the menu and origin of the local foods, contributing greatly to the overall great dining experience which we all agreed would need to be repeated.

Oops!  Almost forgot the Amuse-bouche! - Tiny little Sonoma Grill PBJ bites served between the Sangria and Tapas...  PB was cashew and J was four berry.  Single little attention grabbers to get your focus on flavor.  Well, they were very effective, as our bouches were highly amused the entire visit!"}
{"text":"Nice place. I walked in for lunch today after viewing the menu in the window. After being greeted by the hostess who was ready to seat me, I just told her that I'd just grab a seat at the bar beings as I was solo. 

There was only one other person at the bar giving me the immediate attention of the bartender who presented a menu to me and poured me some water. After another pass at the menu I went for the grilled salmon with wasabi mayo and veggies which came with a side salad. 

As I waited for my lunch I took in the atmosphere. The lighting was soft and the music in the background was progressive giving the place a contemporary appeal.  The seat at the bar are comfortable with an \"inviting you to stay for another\" feel. It's a spacious restaurant and I imagine it gets pretty full before a show but today for lunch there were a lot of empty tables. 

My meal arrived in about fifteen minutes.  The salad was wonderful with the real bacon, pickled onion and blue cheese. The veggies where a generous mix of cabbage, pepper, celery, carrots and beans in a teriyaki sauce. Scrumptious! Unfortunately the salmon fell just a little short of the rest of the meal.  Don't get me wrong, it was very tasty with and without the wasabi dressing but the portion was about 50% smaller than I would have expected. 

The total bill came to $17.07 plus tip. 

The service was excellent, the ambiance was comfortable and the meal was delicious. I could see myself coming back here for a pre-theater dinner with someone special but it's a bit pricey, in my opinion, for a solo lunch break.  Maybe I just don't feel I'm worth it."}
{"text":"good stuff. the table was a bit tight.

we had the valentines prix menu scallops and duck. everything was wonderful including the wine pairings which were fun and appropriate. 

this was a creative meal. fresh greens. 

we started with a Panna Cotta that wasn't on the menu. cauliflower. we believe it had too many ice crystals. it had 1/4\" creamy that was great. the ice crystals might have been a goof but we really don't know. the other super cool flavors on the plate were fun. 

I shouldn't but did have the chocolate brûlée which just about blew my socks off."}
{"text":"Incredible service and delicious wine. I had the duck and was very impressed with the dish. Perfectly prepared and served by a staff that is clearly dedicated to service and fine dining. Every detail was attended to. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We used Yelp to get reservations for our anniversary. It was an interesting place. Great food!!! We will Deffenetly go there again. 

The waitress helped us and explained the menu to us and the wine list. She also answered our (my) questions. 
Great place."}
{"text":"Valentine's Dinner was amazing. Service was awesome. I wish I could have tried the whole menu. The salad was great and I had the onion cannelloni which was amazing. I was so full though that I couldn't finish it. The table next to us had the flounder for two and it looked great. This place is wonderful for a date night."}
{"text":"The Partner In Cuisine (PIC) have found ourselves dining at Sonoma Grille on occasion and each time, we have had an exemplary experience.  We try to patronize establishments that use locally grown, fresh ingredients and Sonoma doesn't disappoint.  

The service and food are great, but get your wallet ready if you go for dinner because you will take a hit on the prices.  I also think that some of the salads are quite small for the price, but at least they are delicious."}
{"text":"Convenient for the hotel crowd, but can be crowded with theatre goers and a bit pricey for dinner.  The wine selection is amazing (they even have had Screaming Eagle).  The wait staff and bar tenders are mostly friendly and knowledgeable, but the place can get overwhelmed (I've had the wrong food delivered and slow service).  I stay at the hotels in the area, but seems that parking can be a problem.  Bottom line is if you don't mind the crowd and price, the food is consistently very good."}
{"text":"I came here for a business dinner, and was generally happy. The atmosphere was absolutely perfect for any occasion. The staff was well meaning (albeit wordy) and the valet parker showed up (albeit late).

I was surprised at some of the menu choices. I didn't think I'd be savoring venison and gnudi at a Californian wine bar tapas steakhouse. Eclectic, yes, ok.

My gnudi appetizer and my venison entree were both supremely over-salted. And I loooooove salt! There is great potential here, but the salt shaker ruins it. Otherwise, great flavors, maybe a little stringy venison, and delicious warm bread with herb butter."}
{"text":"My birthday weekend was in its opening stages the Friday before last, but I had zero clue as to where I wanted Kay to treat me. I settled on Seviche in Downtown Pittsburgh since I had been interested in giving them a try for some time and because the weather was getting blustery (public transit and trolleys are to be praised), but when we occupied Seviche's foyer, we were told that they were completely booked for the evening. That's when one of the greeters referred us to their \"sister restaurant\" across the street, Sonoma. And so began our ceremony...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLznNYtzUWQ

An unused dining room became our nearly private place of worship, of devotion to Demeter and all the culinary pleasures she has granted us this season. 

Julia, our server, had the face of a sprite and the soul of an actress. Her role of the evening was portrayed like that of a lifetime: a high priestess of pure ardor as well as a trusty guide who used make-believe words such as \"flavorite\" to navigate us through the elaborate menu card. I never foresaw coming to this church of Our Lord and Chef Yves Carreau, a French transplant/mastermind with a flair for the dramaturgic and a sense for artistry. Therefore, I hadn't a sliver of an idea as to what I wanted. No matter. Julia would lead Kay and I to Arcadia...

Mass was about to commence...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjPAi2O9vw8

Act I: Weighty cuts of porous bread were served to us with a maple-bacon butter that crashed the gates of night on behalf of the morning star via this amalgam of breakfast and dinner. Sugary, sweet, and lardy make for such glorious percussion, and the well-crafted bread was but a platform for this blurring of day and dusk.

Act II: A golden gremlin of an arancini was complimentary, sneaking into the proceedings to make rich, crispy mischief for its own sake with a syrupy sauce it partially left behind, whispering into our ears, \"Patience, dear friends. The real show is about to begin.\" 

Act III: The Sonoma Salad. Mesclun, romaine, pear julienne, tomato, Point Reyes
Blue Cheese, and Apple-Wood Smoked Bacon cavorted in a bowl like ecstasy-laden clubgoers as a dead-on dijon vinaigrette spilled over all of them like bubbles. Crunchy, brackish, saccharine, and juicy coalesced peacefully, calming and cleansing the tastebuds, preparing me for the carnality to come...

Act IV: The Tower. To climb the Avocado and Crabmeat Tian was to strive for the promised land. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUx278EpubY

That most luscious and fatty of all fruits united with supple crustacean proteins to create an extravagant guacamole embellished with a spicy mayonnaise and chili oil and served with grilled pita triangles, the understudy to tortilla chips. Ascension was nigh. 

Act V: The Study of Hog. Such was Julia the Harelquin's recommendation and it in itself came in 3 parts: 1)Pork belly atop a Celeriac Puree with quail egg, parma
prosciutto, and a lemon demi-glace. 2)Pork butt braised in Blackstrap Stout on sourdough French Toast with bacon, Granny Smith Apples, and Chevre. 3) Cinnamon Chipotle Glazed  Pork Tenderloin on a sweet potato croquette with sherry cranberry cream, and wilted spinach. Part 1 was my initial encounter with pork belly, and it was a judiciously fatty and thick bacon served upon something approaching grits. Those addicted are hopelessly so, and I am now among their ranks, Bourdain's obsession becoming mine as well. Part 2 ventured deeper South for an elegant pulled pork sandwich in miniature, the apples and bacon reminding me that the tart and the saliferous belong together for eternity. Part 3 was a suite of meaty adoration, the pork tenderloin becoming as generous and opulent as filet mignon or a deconstructed gourmet take on the steak hoagie, the alcohol leaving its essence exquisitely. An entree so complex, I could devote an entire review to it, this triumvirate changed my palate forever, expanding my circle like no other dishes have before. 

Act VI: A Descent Into Armageddon. The Gingerbread Cheesecake with a flickering  candle jutting from it embodied good, its festive childhood whimsy laughing in the face of the obsidian Brimstone-bitter downtuned black metal chords of the Chocolate Hazlenut Cake...

With no clear victor, both entities of pure confection and perfection, fell into a void to duel until time's end...

Our meal concluded happily, my first natal day feast of the weekend being an epiphany in every way possible from seating to departure. Sonoma Grille has proven to be Pittsburgh's true sleeper gourmet restaurant. While Kevin Sousa and his Salt of the Earth enjoy the bulk of the acclaim at the moment, Yves Carreau secretly schemes in the catacombs, plotting to claim the throne."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed about the place was the ambiance- despite the size of the restaurant, it maintained quality atmosphere- very romantic, quiet, and sophisticated. I went to Sunday brunch with a girlfriend of mine . I made reservations day of on a gorgeous Sunday morning and we were seated immediately. It wasn't too crowded and there was a live jazz band which we were impressed by. 
Our server Phil was incredibly amazing. Next to our cruise my family and I went on when I was a child, I honestly cannot recall the best service I have had with Phil- he explained the menu in such detail and helped us make our ultimate decision of ordering the two course from the brunch menu as well as his recommendation of getting the Benedict. He was extremely friendly and accommodating- I also work downtown in one of the finer restaurants and Phil out did many of the servers where I work at. We got talking about deserts and he introduced me to one of the pastry/desert staff that morning- her name is Kaitlin if I remember correctly. I appreciated her coming out to see me and talking to her was an honor because her donuts and desert crepes were mouth watering Delicious! 
I would most definitely go back! 
The only reason for the four star is that the portion size was a bit small, it was certainly enough but slightly disappointing."}
{"text":"Late night happy rocks. The crab Blt was amazing. I would come back just for that. The wagyu beef was delicious. The onion soup was terrible on all levels. It was worse than a cafeteria version in your grade school or hospital cafeteria!
However, great spot to grab a drink and some good food, especially with the happy hour discount. Great place to go for happy hour, early or late... Prime locale, nice staff, dig it. If we had not ordered the onion soup would have been a higher rating!!

Sully was an awesome server, super nice and informative and compted the soup!! So dig it even more."}
{"text":"My sweetie and I were in town (from New Orleans) at a woodworking symposium at the Lawrence Convention Center and stayed at the Westin.   I made reservations for Friday lunch at 12:30.  Totally unnecessary as the place was empty.

We were greeted by a nice young lady and seated immediately.  Our server was also there promptly and took our drink order.  We had an appetizer and entrees, no dessert.

The appetizer was a Naan flatbread with mushrooms, feta and greens with a light coating of something like balsamic and was really good.

I had the pork belly tacos and my dearly beloved had the mixed grill, chicken, fried rice and veggies, without the chicken.  It came with a tamarind ginger sauce that she hated so she gave it to me.  

It was fantastic!  In fact, I drenched my pork belly tacos with it. And they were really good to begin with.  I won't go into all the ingredients but it's on the menu.  

My tacos came with a side option and I had the fruit salad - mostly melon - and the sauce again, yes it was good. So I tried it with the melon and yes, it was STILL good :-)

So the overall experience was relaxed, quiet, friendly and overall good but a tad slow, which is why the 4 stars.  Also, the menu is limited so you may want to check it online before you decide to go.  But I'd go back for those tacos and that sauce."}
{"text":"My previous review was based on two disappointing visits for brunch. I was surprised to receive a private message from the GM, who asked for additional feedback. I gave him a very detailed description of my more recent visit - and he responded with a $200 gift certificate to give them another shot. I have to say that I was very impressed - this was certainly the \"right\" thing to do after I had such disappointing visits.

I made a reservation for a Friday night and went in with an open mind. I had already taken a look at the menu online but, as with previous visits, was disappointed to find that the options are quite different on the actual menu. I would suggest that the online menu is more regularly updated - or not posted at all. 

When we arrived, we were seated immediately but waited a long time for service. As I was sitting there, I noticed one table after another who had complaints: the wait was too long, the bill was incorrect, or there was something wrong with their food. I was worried but gave Sonoma a mental mulligan since it was a full house. (NOTE: After the theater crowd cleared out, the restaurant was totally empty.)

We started with the housemade tots, with a spicy aioli sauce. They were tasty but also greasy and not very hot all the way through. We also got a thai lettuce wrap, which was decent but not better than something I could throw together at home. We split the Sonoma Salad. The flavors are spot on but, as with my previous visits, was very overdressed.

For our entrees, my husband had the beef butcher's roast (with wild mushrooms, veggie puree) and I had the double bone pork chop (which was supposed to have cheddar polenta and heirloom carrots - but that which came out with some kind of veggie puree and a sauteed veggie hash). My husband's meal was a bit on the small side, while mine was comically large. They were okay - just not fantastic.

We finished with raspberry orange cheesecake and chocolate mousse - and, finally, I can say that both were superb. Our meal was accompanied by a $72 bottle of barolo, which is reasonable for a barolo. The wine list at Sonoma is one of the reasons that drew me to it in the first place - but the prices are absurd. 

For a place this pricey, I shouldn't have to struggle to say nice things. Also, waiting for everything can really ruin an evening - and, believe me, we waited for everything. The location is fantastic -- Sonoma should be *the* destination for pre-theater or sporting event meals -- however, the service is pretty abysmal and the food, while tasty at times, is overall poorly executed and often not what the menu advertises. I gave Sonoma a fair shot on this return visit -- and really wanted to upgrade from 2- to 2-stars -- however, they have a lot of work to do or I imagine sub-par reviews will become the norm.

On a side note, don't rule out the sister restaurants Seviche and NOLA on the Square. I recommend trying both."}
{"text":"We walked in at about 8:30 PM on a Monday. We got a high table by the window immediately. We ordered the tapas platter for 2 - really delicious shrimp, pretty good pork slider and chicken satay, the beignets were uniformly unliked. The beef crostini was excellent - the favorite of everyone at the table. The french onion soup was surprisingly excellent for being vegetarian. We fought over it. One of us ordered a mahi panini which was really excellent as well. Our waiter was personable, friendly and really attentive. The manager came out and served our food and was making the rounds in the restaurant. Just a really, really pleasant experience with excellent food - we were impressed with how reasonable the drinks were priced too. We would definitely go back here again! Also, Hilary Duff sat next to us with her hubby. LIFE WIN."}
{"text":"Wonderful NYE menu. Food was A+. Great wine list. Knowledgeable staff. Great pairings with the food. Terrific ."}
{"text":"Great service & Great Food.

Visiting the Pittsburgh area and stopped at this location since my go to stop was closing soon. This is a more high end restaurant and I was completely under dressed just leaving the Steelers game. 

Service was good and my waiter recommended a good wine & meal which I enjoyed both. I was completely wasted but I do remember enjoying my food, wine & service .

I would recommend and would visit again."}
{"text":"Sonoma Grille is 3.5 stars in my book. Grabbed a bite to eat before a show and glad we made reservations though they could only squeeze us in at 5:30. Our waiter was laid back with some zingers in during the whole meal. We liked him. Ordered the wild mushroom flatbread to share with the table and had the scallops for my entree along with two sparkling white wines. The whole meal was delicious though felt it was on the expensive side as I wasn't blown away per say. I would come back if someone wanted to go and give the SG another try."}
{"text":"My late lunch was nothing short of fantastic.  

Our waiter, Evan, walked the fine line between attentive and intrusive, very well. (He also had a really cool, plaid tie.)

I orderd the Soft Shell Crab Po Boy, which came with a side of ff or pasta salad ($10). I chose pasta salad, which was a huge portion, served in a deep bowl. The pasta was corkscrew, a refreshing change from elbows, or bow tie. It was tossed lightly in some light oil, but not greasy or slimy.

The sandwich roll, was stuffed with a tender crab on each half, with shredded lettuce, and a couple of small, fresh tomato slices.

My Day Tripper Sangria was the perfect accompaniment, light, crisp, and refreshing."}
{"text":"Having been here twice, I must say that I am impressed with the venue, the staff, and the quality of the food items.  Their mac and cheese with duck is divine and I was so impressed with my desert that  I actually got to meet one of their pastry chefs, Kaitlin! With that kind of customer-centric focus its no wonder that Sonoma Grill is doing so well!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The wine selection was impressive and our waiter or had some great recommendations. To start we had 3 domestic cheeses all very good, then I had lobster ravioli, and the husband had the Japanese bass. Both were delicious as well as their sides.  Dessert was a chocolate brulé also very good. The manager stopped in to see how everything was and she was a delight as well. We even enjoyed the service from boy busing our table. My only critique would be the decor seemed a bit dated, but over all a great place for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to Sonoma Grille on several occasions and this was probably my least favorite experience. Due to its central downtown location surrounding by other great restaurants, I hold Sonoma to a high standard that it did not reach at my lunch on Sunday. The salads we ordered were tasty but inconsistent, each one of us had different amounts of different ingredients or some ingredients missing completely? Although our waiter was very kind and polite, he brought seltzer instead of tonic and completely forgot to bring us bread after we had asked. Finally, the meal was tasty but my Stripped Bass dish was slightly oily with A LOT of excess liquid. My risotto was swimming, which defeated the purpose of have the green pea mash because it turned into soup.  Overall, expensive for not that great of a result. I hope next time will be better"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food plagued by horrendous service (quite possibly one of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant). We stopped in on a Saturday evening when the restaurant was lively but not overwhelming. We arrived with a reservation and was naïve enough to expect that would allow us to be seated quickly. The hostess was no where to be found for the 15 minutes, leaving a group of 10 people huddled awkwardly by the entrance. It wasn't until 30 minutes later when we were finally seated.

Once seated, the horrible service continued. 15-20 minutes go by and no one greets us. As I was about ready to pack up and head to the closest McDonalds, the waitress finally comes and we took the opportunity to throw in our appetizer and entrée orders before she could escape. 

Half an hour later, my baby kale salad comes out and missing at least 2 toppings shown on the menu, but I was so hungry at this point that a couple pecans and pieces of cheese were not even worth it. As I chomped down on mostly kale stems, I stared at my boyfriend's order of tater tots longingly, regretting my decision. Avoid the kale salad guys. As we were waiting for our entrée, I devoured all the free table bread - which, quite honestly, was my favorite bread basket I've had.

The seitan pot au feu was incredible! So delicious that I shameless scraped the bowl clean. First off, so impressed that they have a vegetarian menu item that's not some lame pasta. Not only that, it was insanely delicious. One of the best seitan dishes I have had. Highly highly recommend! My boyfriend had the Korean BBQ dish and as picky as he is with Asian cuisine, he absolutely loved it. Props to an American restaurant for knocking this one out of the park. 

It really pains me to give them 2 stars when they had probably the best food I've had in a while, but atrocious service can ruin a dining experience. I would definitely return for the food and would highly recommend Sonoma Grille - just be prepared for the wait."}
{"text":"Wine on wine on wine. The best duck I have ever had, I order it every time now! The staff is incredibly knowledgable about their wine; Our servers every time have been super friendly and really make the experience enjoyable and personal. But truly, exploring their wine menu is one of my favorite things to do!!"}
{"text":"I'm just wondering why the service is always so shitty. I'm not even kidding you guys. Go to Sonoma maybe 2 times a year and it always sucks. Look if you don't like the service industry, get out. This should be a four star review but because of the service it's simply three stars. The Sunday Brunch is the saving grace.
Two course Prix Fixe only $19. $9 Make your own bloodies or mimosas. Other selections like omlettes and burgers on brunch menu. 
For dinner we really like family-style because it's $60 for two people and the roast is fantastic.
Let's get those employees to love their work as much as we love the food. If only..."}
{"text":"Even though this place had three stars (and three $ signs, which made my cheap side a little worried) I still had heard a lot of good word of mouth, so I wanted to try it out.  

I went about this dining process by rating it as the action started.  Our server walks up to us and asks if we had ever been there.  His response was great, telling us all about the farm to table experience they try to create there.  He was extremely helpful in picking out our drinks, Lyeth Meritage for me...at $14 a glass...YIKES.  But it was really light and refreshing for a red wine.  My friend got a gin and tonic, the gin being infused with cucumber deliciousness (I assure you, I tried it a couple times).  We're 5 stars at this point folks.

We both decided on the tasting menu since everything looked good.  $35 for three courses is pricey for me, but I was splurgin' here (dah, $14 wine).  To start I choose the Wild Mushroom Flatbread.  Now bear in mind, I thought the tasting menu portions would be, well, tasting size.  It was regular appetizer size, you know, for like two people.  I ate almost all of it....other than the piece I shared with my friend.  It was THAT good.  Porto mushrooms, pesto and feta cheese.  YUM!  Still 5 stars people.

I was torn between a the healthy Sonoma Salad and the Pecan Crusted Haluomi.  Since my friend is generous, she said she'd get the cheese and give me a piece.  Win win!  The salad was good but the Haluomi...holy crap!  It was amazing!  I cannot believe it's served as a whole meal.  It comes with potatoes and broccoli, but I would need something else.  Even though cheese does fill lots of voids in my life.  

At this point we've downgraded the score to 3 stars because our second course came out AN HOUR after our first course was served.  The server came by only once to say our courses would be close together (because we were going to a show and in a rush at this point).  He never came by to ask if I wanted another glass of wine (a no, but still).  Or just to tell us the kitchen was running slow tonight, etc.  I would have taken any excuse.  But there was nothing.     

Final course was the Crispy Indonesian Glazed Duck.  Don't get me wrong, it was VERY good and crispy, but I thought the glaze overpowered it enough where I felt like I was eating at a Chinese restaurant....where my meal would have been $8.  

Regardless of the wait times I still thought the meal was solid, if not a tad overpriced.  Would I go back?  Yes.  Would I soon or frequently?  Probably not.  The mystery of the 3 star rating has been solved.  

Sonoma Grill, get on your game, you could be a 5 star!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Sonoma Grille in Pittsburgh many times over the past five years and have always been pleased with the quality of food and service.  The decor hasn't changed over that time frame, but the food is what is important and it has always been excellent.  During my last visit there I had a lamb dish served as an open face sandwich with mashed potatoes and it was delicious.  I've eaten both lunch and dinner at Sonoma Grille and have been very pleased with both.  It's not too noisy either, even when full."}
{"text":"Waitress with shoulder length red hair (Elizabeth A) was VERY nasty to our party.  For example, when we asked what drinks they had, her response was 'we have everything.' So when we replied with the beverage they we wanted her response was 'oh, we ran out of that.'  How about you provide the type of service that is expected. Overall experience was poor and we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went to Happy Hour here with a friend yesterday.  I had heard it is one of best places for happy hour downtown.  We were seated and given water promptly.  I asked a staff person what was featured for happy hour.  She said that happy hour is only available \"at the bar and on the tile floor.\" and walked away.  Whoops, we were on carpet.  ...and she didn't answer my question.  

We asked to be reseated (on the TILE FLOOR), which our server did quickly and graciously.  The happy hour food is \"half price plus a dollar\" which feels like they are nickel and diming me, so I didn't get food.  We ordered wine, which turned out to be $7 each.  More than we expected as we understood happy hour wines were $4, but definitely not outrageous.  An observation from our table on the tile floor near the window was that a party seated outdoors waited so long for service that they left.  

All I did was drink wine.  And I liked it.  But I can't comment on the food.  I don't think I'll go back because this experience was pretty poor."}
{"text":"I go here often and the bartenders are really good.  I'm not sure if it's because I'm a regular, but I find the wait staff here excellent.  It's a pretty good location with valet parking and a fun spot \"seviche\" across the street which has the same owner.  It's never too crowded and they have plenty of comfy seating with couches and chairs not just barstools.  The wine selection is great, but overpriced.  I can pay $33 for a bottle of cakebread chardonnay at the liquor store, but they charge $150 here.  A 5x multiple is just too much and I think a little greedy.  They also don't have guiness on tap which I believe every bar should have.  I was there last night and was particularly disappointed with the food.  That's why I decided to write a review.  Again, overall this is a pretty good place usually.  I think they need to have more features with  respect to the menu.  The menu doesn't seem to change much to me and I find it a bit boring, but again I go here often so I've tried many of the options.  Last night I had this pork dish that was supposed to be a pork chop and also a side of \"pork belly\".  The chop wasn't that good. I've had bettter quality at TG Mcfunsters... for god's sake and the pork belly wasn't really pork belly which is supposed to be oozing with flavor and texture.  A friend had the calamari, which was cold and not that good.  It was better after the staff heated it up.  Another friend had the menu item where you can pick one, two, or three proteins to pair with sides.  He had the shrimp tempura which I tried and it was pretty good.  On other visits I've had the \"kobe\" hamburger.  I'm not sure if it's kobe beef, but it's a pretty good burger.  I also really like the avocado and crab appetizer.  This is probably my favorite menu item.  They have a nice cheese board, but on two occassions when I ordered the cheese was ice cold when it should have been room temperature.  Overall a fun time, but I would suggest just going there for a few drinks and saving your appetite for some of the other downtown restaurants like Nine on Nine a block down the street."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the door we were treated wonderfully. Danny (the hostess) made good small talk and was very friendly. Phil, our server was A ++. He did an excellent job explaining what to expect from the food and the bar. He was quick to answer any of our questions. His recommendations and descriptions were on pointe. If you go here, ask for Phil, you will be treated like royalty. 
The food was great. I ordered chicken coq au vin (spelling may be off). It was great. The chicken was juciy, tender and oh so flavorful. It had a delicious mushroom sauce with cremini mushrooms, onion and bacon on a bed of great mashed potatoes. The other half ordered a filet and mushroom kabob with mixed veggies. The filet was cooked to perfection and the marinade was the perfect kabob taste, in this reviewers opinion. 
I loved the atmosphere and the staff here. It is well deserving of the rating it has here. Can't wait to try it again!!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed.  When we first arrived, 7:15 on a Friday night, the restaurant is empty and we had to wait for them to set our table.  I realize that the theater crowd just left but with the people all gone how long does it take to reset a table of 4 for a 7:45 reservation. Then, while setting the table the hostess set all the glasses by touching the rims.  Yuck. So the ladies ordered glasses of wine and the men Woodford and ginger ale. The waitress came back and said they only had enough Woodford for one drink!  They would have been better off saying they didn't have Woodford as it was more like enough for 1/2 of a drink. We ordered an appetizer to share and our meals. The waitress came back again and said they were out of shrimp so one person had to order a second choice but she made no mention of what they would do with the appetizer as it had shrimp on it also. When we asked she said they were going to substitute calamari. The food was decent but the experience was terrible. They have lost a customer."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant! Try the wild mushroom flatbread while you're there.... so good!"}
{"text":"This place is a staple when I'm in Pittsburgh. Fantastic happy hour menu, and I've never eaten something I haven't enjoyed."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5, but it's definitely closer to 4, than 3. Salmon dinner was really delicious. But the tapas appetizer was random, very gluten-filled, and the flavors just weren't there. Server was knowledgeable but overbearing and judgmental of our food choices. The salmon was so good, as was the Pims Cup, and enough to bring it to a 3.5/4."}
{"text":"I got the Tapas for two, a salad to share, and the salmon plate. This place is an insult to Californian style cuisine. It is California if you have never been to California. Don't waste your time coming here.

My mom and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant is shaped like an L, with a front dining area facing the street and a back area that faces the kitchen. the decor is classy, which is appreciated. The service, however, sucks. We sat down at 8 on a not-so-busy-night and it took the waitress 45 minutes to take our order. Maybe it was a busy night, which could explain the wait for food, but it shouldn't explain why it took so long for her to ask us what we wanted to eat. 

It took 30 minutes for the tapas to come, which ended up being cold and terrible. The ravioli was tough and rubbery and had come to room temperature. The buns on the pork belly were mushy and vaguely reminded me of peeps (those marshmallow chickens from Easter time), and the croquettes are more rice than crab and equally as cold as the fried shrimp. The only enjoyable thing we ate all night was the salmon charcuterie board, which had an interesting balance of creamy and salty, something I couldn't say about the rest of the meal.

The waitress felt pretty bad about us waiting so long for food, which is appreciated, but it was too little too late. I would not recommend this dining experience to anyone I know. If you're looking for a better dining experience, just go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"Sonoma Grill is a downtown place with a downtown feel.  The decor is just plain boring and the seem to try too hard.  On top of the overprices mediocre food the staff has always left something to be desired.

If you are interested a decently sized wine list and want to have a drink after work stop in, but you are better off eating someplace else."}
{"text":"I recently went to Pittsburgh for a conference and ate at Sonoma Grille.  Boy was I impressed!

We had 8:30 reservations, so the walk to the restaurant was cold and dark.  I walked in and immediately felt a little warmer.  The walls are painted in warm colors with murals on some walls.  I felt like I was walking into a Tuscan or California restaurant.  (Though I do admit that it kind of reminded me of the Olive Garden, ugh.)  

The restaurant was farm-to-table.  Everything was extremely flavorful and fresh.  Price-wise, it seemed reasonable for the portions and the quality of the food.

When traveling, I always try to look for basic food (since I never know the quality of the restaurant.)  I saw the menu and went--huh?  Many of the foods mix flavors and ingredients that I would never think to combine.  For example, we had the pecan crusted haloumi--fried cheese that was encrusted with pecans and placed upon a bed of a jalopeno potato puree with mango avocado salsa in a blood orange reduction.  Like I said--Huh? 

That being said, I was incredibly impressed with all the food.  The pecan crusted haloumi was a favorite appetizer at the table.  We all tried to be polite and take small pieces of it, but I'm pretty sure any one of us would have been happy to devour the entire plate.  Similarly, the med plate, with hummus, feta, sun-dried tomato, and hearts of palm, quinoa tabbouleh, olives, and pita, was delicious.  The hummus was probably the best hummus I've ever had.

The tempura shrimp was solidly good, though not as memorable as our appetizers.  Like I said, completely fresh.

The time between our appetizers and entrees was a bit long, but the restaurant was packed with people from the conference.  I left completely full and happy.

I can't comment on the quality or prices of the wines, but I noticed they had an impressive selection.  

Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Another A-OK but \"nothing special\" meal for me while in Pittsburgh. Went here with a small group and was definitely impressed with the service, our server was really out going and personable without being over-the-top; very charming and witty. 

Started with a few cocktails and was happy with the pour; not as chinsey with the vodka as Sharp Edge (I could actually taste the vodka). 

Ordered a shrimp appetizer and while it was seasoned OK, it didn't taste like fresh shrimp should --- maybe fresh frozen or something? I am not 100% sure, it just tasted a little rubbery and texturally it was off a bit. 

I followed it up with the petit filet mignon, creamy mashed potato's and brocolini (which I absolutely love). The steak was seasoned nicely and cooked just the way I ordered it; melted in my mouth. The creamy mashed went down pretty smooth as well but I have definitely had better.

If you're staying in downtown Pittsburgh, I would recommend you give it a shot. Not sure you'll be blown away but you'll get a good meal."}
{"text":"Weekday lunch trip to Sonoma Grille on the boss?  Sign me up.  

I had been to Sonoma Grille several years ago for dinner and vaguely remembered the place.  Much to my surprise, almost nothing had changed!  The interior looked exactly the same as I had remembered it.  

The service was prompt and courteous as expected, and the menu offered and interesting selection of lunch and pseudo-breakfast dishes, including chorizo.  Everyone in our party was satisfied with their meal, although the fish tacos looked extremely watery to me, with liquid dripping out of each taco.  Not exactly my kind of fish taco.

The portions were a bit on the small side, including the piece of salmon I got in my salad, but again, that's kind of expected here.  Overall, it was a pleasant lunch, with everyone satisfied but not incredibly overwhelmed.  At this price point, I think there are better upscale lunch options in town."}
