{"text":"With so many restaurants in this lovely plaza, you're sure to find some decent food (but at a high price). Comptoir was a short walking distance from the pier so we decided to have lunch here. We ordered the margarita pizza & bruschetta; both were pretty good! Service was a bit lacking, but we understood because the servers were dealing with high volumes of tourists during lunch time."}
{"text":"If you are at the Old Port area in Montreal and are looking for a place to have an EXCELLENT artisan pizza with fantastic (not snooty) service by young, and very pleasant waitstaff then this is the place to go to.
Ate here yesterday with a party of 6 and our server Alicia was not only VERY VERY nice and attentive but also provided some tips on places to visit which was very helpful.
The decor of this place is very welcoming with an old world feel because of its stone walls yet slightly industrial with a French cafe gwist
We had the margherita pizza (XL size) and it was sooo good that we came back the next day for lunch! 
Consistency in quality food and quality service something every visitor to a new city welcomes.  THANK YOU!

PS - Ask for the spicy olive oil for the pizza (YUM!) and the crepes and tiramisu are delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the \"Montrealaise\" pizza which is the same as a pepperoni pizza in the US but it was delicious. Fresh, made to order, and cooked perfectly. Do note though, that a large pizza is equivalent to a small - medium size pizza in the US. Nice atmosphere was a bonus."}
{"text":"We ordered from this place with foodora, the salad my boyfriend took wasnt good. I ordered a creep and asked to remove the meat since i am a vegetarian, it came with ham in it...Small portions and really basic meal. Not worth the price."}
