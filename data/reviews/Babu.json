{"text":"We ordered
Meat/Vegetable Samosas
Butter Chicken
Assorted Desserts
Naan 

This is considering as a fast food environment 
Samosas: They were very good, great for a quick snack and has a great taste  
Butter Chicken: Mediocre at best, tasted pretty much like chicken with a very plain tomato sauce put onto it. Some of the pieces were very hard meat while the others were chewy.... 
Assorted Desserts: Very good! Very sweet but goes well with tea or coffee
Naan: Not very good, Garlic naan tastes bitter contrasting with naan 

Its okay, I wouldn't have it again although the pricing is very good"}
{"text":"Giving this 4 stars solely on their lunch special (tons of food but cheap), their mutton rolls, and their mutton/chicken rotis! Spicy as tamil food always is. Service can fluctuate. This place is a walk in place with no seating so be prepared to take your food home or enjoy it somewhere else. FYI: THE LUNCH SPECIAL IS ALL DAY!!!"}
{"text":"In the last six months, the taste has been degrading so much. Why? Biryani rice is like  a cheap fried rice with lots of unevenly cooked white rice. Butter chicken and other vegetable curry lost the harmony of curry, taste just like a blending ingredients not cooked. 
It's fast ready to go curry that why ?  Curry in India is a soul food but I feel Babu lost a soul of curry."}
{"text":"We were driving home from downtown last night after a long day, and my wife had a fancy for Indian food. Even though there are quite a few Indian eateries in Markham, I hadn't found anything particularly authentic or enjoyable until I came across Babu on Yelp (the iPhone saved the day!).

I'd never had Sri Lankan food before but for those who enjoy Indian food, Babu has many classics such as butter chicken. The Pakistani biriyani (thanks Devan!) was much richer, spicier and more flavourful than the biriyani's we've had from closer to Steeles.

However, it was the naan and the kothu roti that really blew my mind. While most of the food is severed from warming stations, both these dishes are made fresh when you walk in. If you've never had naan directly from the tandoor, you're in for a treat. Almost blackened on one side, moist and fluffy without being doughy -- I could have eaten three. 

Kothu roti is apparently a traditional sri lankan dish that then gets chopped into small pieces -- the guy doing the chopping had probably the leanest forearms I've ever seen, likely from doing this all day! It's delicious, that's all I can say.

If you're afraid of spice (which you shouldn't be), do bear in mind a lot of the food is quite spicy. Talk to the friendly staff for less spicy options.

We spent $32 incl. tax on a feast that's fed myself and my wife for two dinners now, and we still have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Fantastic value for food so yummy!

Don't be put off by four star rating -- I'm harsh ;) Go check out Babu and make your own mind up."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm in love with this place!

Setup like a take out cafetaria, you have your whole array of choices in front of you.  They have well over 20+ items.  One thing that blew me out of this world was their vegetable samosas.  Light, crispy dough with soft potatoes inside.  You can't just eat one, they keep coming at you.  $1 for 3 is a total bargain.

I also ordered some roti to be enjoyed with some homemade curry.  Nice, flat roti, slightly sweet, and totally soft.

Must come back to try more goodies!"}
{"text":"I enjoy South Indian food.  I particularly enjoy it for its flavour, particularly the vegetarian dishes.  Babu's does a great job showcasing South Indian food.  However, their use of SALT is excessive.  Preparing the food with the flavour and attention to detail i.e. as it would be prepared \"at home\", would eliminate the need for excessive salt.

The food is freshly made, the service is great, very affordable per serving, well-labelled dishes, the premises clean, BUT the saltiness (and sometimes the oiliness) of the food has very definitely put me off.  One person in the reviews has mentioned feeling ill after eating Babu's food and I wondered if Babu's uses MSG!?!"}
{"text":"I went here today and the food was delicious!  I ordered the mixed vegetable biryani combo with 3 sauce. The sauces were very flavourful and the rice tasted really good. The portions are HUGE here and cheap. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"OK I live right around the corner to this take out joint, so I drop in every now and then. It's really clean inside and everything is fresh, including all of their baked goods. You know it's clean when the kitchen has windows...

I'll be honest with you that I don't really understand how to order anything here and I really don't know what the heck I'm eating, I just know it's tasty.

The only menu item that I can pronounce is the lampri. This thing is only like 7 bucks and can last for 2-3 meals!

Basically, they fill a massive banana leaf with the rice of your choice, then douse it with 5 or 6 of your choice of \"curries\". I have no idea what they are, so I just point and hope for the best! Then they add some fried fish and a boiled egg in the center, fold it up and then steam it! 7 bucks!!!

My only gripe is that the menu items should be labelled a little better and their pricing system a little clearer. Other than that, no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Never actually been, but my friend buys samosas from here all the time. $1 for three or something. Really good. Best samosas I've had. A bit on the tiny side, but good snack portion."}
{"text":"so this place serves all its food from a bunch of steam tables like a buffet, its a take out only Indian place in an out of the way part of Markham, so i expected good value.

i was wrong, curry goat, butter chicken ect is sold in three different sizes, the small is very small probably just over a cup, for 3.95, that's not good value to me 

the white meat bbq chicken was very dry and was 9 bucks for 6 small pieces

the other issue i had was that all the food was stone cold by the time i got home 

this makes me question the temperature of the hot table and if it is not set hot enough to keep bacteria at bay, this place may be sickening everyone 

so in short, not a good value, so so food, dangerous food handling = never going back"}
{"text":"Very good Tamil/South Asian food! Takeout only but good service from the staff. Highly recommend the mutton roll, biryani rice, koththu roti, and Malaysian noodles. Tandoori chicken is good too. 

The price is reasonable and portions big. They are changing their menu signs l, so I guess prices are going up."}
{"text":"Best price for the best Sri Lankan food! Must try snacks: pattice and samosa. I find the fish pattice to be most tasty and full of spice whereas the vegetarian pattice tastes exactly the same as veg samosa. I recommend trying the Lamprais - banana leaf wrapped briyani rice with three/four curries (any meat) and vegetables with caramelized eggplants. Great dish to share with friends and families!"}
{"text":"Great place!  We first went to the Sheppard location and then Babu opened up closer to us on McCowan.  The food is inexpensive and tasty.  We especially love the meat Lumpri - you get a choice of one meat and 6 curries on a bed of rice.  It's all wrapped up in a banana leaf and heated up.  Delicious and spicy and definitely enough for 2 people!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to get food from.  Always fresh...they have a consistency that it's a bit hard to find these days when I go to take out restaurants.

The chicken Korma is so delicious!! 

It's super affordable and the quantaty they give you always makes for great left overs! :)"}
{"text":"Super cheap take out food. Big portions! If u want cheap and spicy food, I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"When all you want is a butter chicken and naan to solve a craving, this is the place! For $5 you can have both. My only issue with this place is the lack of signage in front of the steam tables. As someone who isn't that familiar with Tamil (Indian?) food it would be much more helpful to know what is being offered in front of me. But I'm loving the idea of $5 butter chicken with one piece of their giant naan anytime."}
{"text":"This is a decent Indian takeout place to satisfy late night cravings because of the extended opening hours. It's always a fun experience to see many different kinds of curries through the glass display. 

There's also a bakery attached to the restaurant and that's where magic happens. You have a wall of freshly baked bread, piping hot samosas and other fried treats piled up high on trays. If you're feeling particularly indulgent, you can also pick up some sweets like gulab jamun, which are probably 500 calories each. 

Docking a point off because the cashier was slow and seemed inexperienced in dealing with the lines. By the time I got home, my meal had already gone cold."}
{"text":"Yes sure the service is fast but the food is not fresh. On two separate occasions I've ordered food here and put the left overs in the fridge. Next day when I took them out they had gone bad. If the food goes bad so fast something is not right. Won't return."}
{"text":"Really disappointed lately. I am finding that the food and portion size is not consistent. 

Decided to try them again this week. I ordered a chicken dosa which is usually stuffed with potatoes and grilled chicken pieces. However, when I took it home, it was stuffed with raw onions, some chicken pieces and BONE. I had to keep spitting out my food cause I would bite into a small bone. Unfortunately, it was too far for me to go back to the store. Really disappointed and felt completely ripped off as I had to throw everything away."}
{"text":"The large takeout place with multiple stations seemed a little intimidating when u first walk in and don't know what to order, but the staff were friendly, so it wasn't so bad. 

Place was sparkly clean, food was good, large portions of rice talif and fairly inexpensive. 

Neat place, recommended if u r craving Indian food of a higher takeout place quality.

Tip mutton rolls maybe one star spicy, but they are spicy!"}
{"text":"Great food and nice service.

I had the lamb and also fish as snacks, they tasted really good but the only thing I had to complain is about the sauce. Maybe not my cup of tea, but well, overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times to grab some quick rolls or samosas. This last visit, ordered a fish roll and a mutton roll... and due to lack of protein I couldn't tell at all which one I was eating. Last bite of the mutton roll there was a tiny piece of meat. The rolls ARE a dollar so I can't expect much I suppose. Deliciously spiced - I may have to give other things a try here."}
{"text":"I've been to Babu's many times since they opened (which, by the way, is not anywhere close to the 20 years they claim - they're closer to 2 than 20, more like 5), and I have to say that their food is subpar.  I don't even go to them for naans because they are so bad.

Unfortunately, my family and I would keep dropping by since they're so close to FreshCo, but the food is just as bad or worse than we remember.  The flat breads are not the way they're supposed to be (I won't go into comparisons of their naans and rotis) and their vegetable and chicken curries have the wrong spices in them in that they don't taste good.  I don't know if it's because they have South Indian or Sri Lankan chefs but their North Indian is sub-par.  If you're going to eat there, stick with South Indian / Sri Lankan dishes.

Even though we're based in Unionville, my family and I will end up making our weekly Indian food pick-up run to Samosa King at McCowan and Finch or Mistaan at Victoria Park and McNicholl.  That says it all as we hate crossing Steeles and we hate standing in long lines, which the former has."}
{"text":"Food is good and cheap, but if you go there after 8 pm, it WILL be cold and need a reheat.

The last two trips i have picked up the Meat Thali, which is supposed to come with salad and soup, but it has had neither.

It is REALLY hectic in there -- always busy, and tonight there wa some kind of mix up and i got someone elses food!  It was stll good, but i have no idea what i got, but i feel sorry for the person who got MY order...."}
{"text":"When I lived in the neighbourhood, I would frequent Babu a lot. I loved it when it first opened, and everything was fresh and looked and smelled delicious. It's been a few years now but upon my last visit I expected the same. It's not what it used to be. Corners have been cut and even the smell isn't delicious. It barely looks clean. The staff have gone from nice and welcoming to complacent and even rude. It's a shame, their mutton rolls were my favourite but I wouldn't recommend getting a meal here."}
{"text":"Service is horrible.  It's a take out place but a lot of items have to be made fresh... I don't mind if it's at a timely manner but 30 mins wait for naan bread is ridiculous.  Ordered fried noodles another time and the same thing!  Other than the curry their fried noodles aren't tasty at all."}
{"text":"Great for a quick indian meal takeout.  The butter chicken and eggplant are both great dishes.  Also love their little snacks (samosas, etc.)"}
{"text":"Awesome food and incredible prices - how do they do it for those prices ???????!! I love the butter chicken and samosas and onion bargis most of all !!!!!!! And the lovely staff who are so patient with us idiot Caucasians who don't really know how to order but just trust the fabulous waiters !!!"}
{"text":"Walked into Babu and was taken by surprise as it was like a large assembly line.  It was packed to the doors with people lining up waiting for someone to help them out.  I wasn't too familiar on what to order but my server was super friendly and answered all our questions.  Yes, we had a lot  to ask but he kindly explained what dish was to us and never lost his patience.  He even made some recommendations to us and asked if you can handle spice or not.  Finally we decided on a few items and he told us to pay at the other side.  Which was kind of confusing as I walk to the side where the bakery is and it was even more crowded.   Took us more than 10 mins to pay for items but I saw others paying where the server assisted them. I wasn't upset cause we were in the sweet section and I was looking for more items to try.  We got some samosa and we wanted to get some other deep fried goods but didn't know what it was.  One of the worker was so nice and gave us one of each fried item to try for free; he nicely packed it up in a paper-bag and gave it to me with my other food.  It caught me off guard as it was a pleasant surprise.  He said once you try them you will be back for more. haha so he was right as I am looking for my next visit to Babu already.

Overall, the food quality and price is very good but there is no where to sit to eat, just for take out.  The place is clean and they have tons of workers behind the counters.

{"text":"so disappointed.  2 days of diarrhea stomach flu from the tuna balls..... i went to the scarborough location. They moved to a tenporary store as tge original store is under renovations. The temporary store is freaking crummy and hot inside. I suspect the tuna balls went bad In the poor temperature location.  took the food for granted and killed my stomach of 2 daya of food poisoning ..so disappointed as i ate here before and was really impressed. will no longer go back again.. prefer the cleaner place next door Silver Spoon."}
{"text":"Really liking the new store!!! The store feels bright and welcoming. A great take out joint with tons of options. They had lamb samosa which were basically the same price as the veggie ones!!

We have the mutton rice Thali with a variety of vegetarian dishes, four lamb samosa and a lamb roll. The total came up to $10. Two of us are it after a camping trip, we were very hungry.. and still had left overs!! They packed the box of rice full enough to feed 3 people. Definitely worth the money!! Every dish was very rich and tasty. The lamb was moisture, tender and flavourful with every bite. Every time I go there seems to be a few different vegetarian dishes.

Not much customer service bit if you're looking for fast, great quality Indian food then this is definitely the place to check out."}
{"text":"One could say that my reviews are somewhat one-sided, and in all honesty I probably wouldn't disagree. The reason why is because I have a tendency to only review things that sweep me off my feet, things that blow me out of the park, things that make me want to write about it to so others can share in the surreal moments. Well, it's happened again, and here I am drooling over my keyboard. 

The name is Babu Catering & Takeouts Bakery & Sweets. This take-out/delivery only restaurant brings warmth to my ora. I have not felt this compelled to drop a review since I ate at Pizzeria Libretto (221 Ossington, T.O.)

One of the key selling points of Babu's is the exceptional spread. For a restaurant like this to offer so many fresh dishes along with tons of sweets and fresh baked goods is overwhelming. Overall the food is spicier than the average Indian food because of the Tamil style of cooking. I would recommend asking for moderately spicy dishes if you're sensitive to spicy style food, and do not be afraid to ask the staff, they are kind and helpful often letting you taste dishes before selecting. 

Babu's offers all kinds of dishes both Tamil and Indian. Dosais & sambars, various kothu roti's, malaysian noodles, roughly a dozen meat curries, a dozen veggie curries, and tons of other greats such as biryani, chili chicken and  both tamil and Indian, just to name a few. They boast the largest menu of fresh food that I have veer seen, the list literally goes on and on. All the curries and dishes I've tried thus far are all outstanding, exploding with flavour and spice. 

In one section of the storefront you will find many classic vegetarian Tamil and Indian dishes such as: Dal makhni, kadhi, shahi paneer, mattar paneer, payasam, chutney, sambal just to name a few. The mushroom curry and channa is delish here as well. At any given time they have 6 different types of rice going and many variations of delicious and moist biryani. 

After conversing with staff members, I began to learn that the individuals in charge of the various types and styles of cuisine at Babu's have all been hand selected and some have even come from abroad to do what they do best.  The tandoori chicken, seekh kababs, and chicken tikka are all cooked in a tandoor operated by an individual who has mastered the art of cooking in this clay contraption of magic. The gentlemen in charge of kothu roti's as well I'm told is the best of the best, when he gets to chopping up the meal there are pieces of egg, meat and roti flying everywhere. By eating the food here you will come to realize these chaps are bang on.

So long story drastically short, this whole experience becomes even better when you go to pay. On average each dish costs roughly $3-4. Today I had a lunch take out container with 2 meats, 2 veggies and basmati rice + bottle water, $6.69. On other days I'll order a beef Kothu Roti w/ 2 pieces of chicken tikka + bottle water, $9.40. Did I mention the Kothu Roti feeds 3 people??

I could sit here and write about Babu's until my fingers go numb, this place is a must. Not only is the taste and quality of food outstanding, not only is it cheap as chips, but the Markham storefront is cleaner than clean. I feel a great sense of pride ordering food there because of how immaculate they keep the place. The restaurants I frequently go to for my Indian/Asian food fixes could not hold a candle to Babu's.  The counter tops are all stainless steel and the venue has a sleek organized look to it. By far the cleanest venue I have ever ordered Indian or Tamil food from. 

A must for the food lover.


Below is the hardest \"Ideal Order\" I have ever tried to draw up. Simply because there is too much to eat. Nonetheless, ordering the below will have you hooked. 

Ideal Order
-Veggie/Chicken/Beef/Mutton Kothu Roti (feeds 3 ppl, very spicy)
-Roast Mutton Curry (spicy)
-Butter Chicken
-Pakistani Biryani
-Chicken Tikka or Tandoori Chicken
-Naan"}
{"text":"Hmm.... where to start..
Honestly.. I would never think I would try Babu... but one day running through yelp reviews and so on.., I had a craving to try biryani rice and omg.... I'm so glad I came across babuuu ;) !!

Seriously guys... if you love spicy food...  COME HERE AND TRY THEIR LUNCH SPECIAL .... 

I ordered  butter chicken biryani rice and omgggggggggg sooooo delicious.... BUT SO SPICY... its so spicy that I  couldn't take more than 3 spoons of rice/chicken every 15 minutes..  but seriously.. its so good.. the chicken is so soft and falls apart easily ... the rice is so yummy... 

the bad thing is i got a stomach ache afterwards.. Not sure if its the food or its from something else but... 

I will get it again! Because it's honestly so worth $5....  I had to split the rest of my lunch for dinner cause there was just TOO much..."}
{"text":"Babu is great.
Iconic Sri Lankan takeout joint is just always \"on the money\". 
I especially love getting a big bag of their dirt-cheap, but delicious little half-moon deep fried veggie patties and samosas, (with a few mutton and chicken thrown in for variety), as well as their kotthu roti and huge range of 'curry dishes' - from mild and flavorful biryani and tikka/tandoori to the truly incendiary, face-meltingly hot Sri Lankan lampries, a ton of food wrapped in a banana leaf and guaranteed to clear your sinuses, and induce a sweat.
For those who complain it is not authentic Indian food, well yes, that's because it's Sri Lankan take-our food that also includes a few Indian dishes :)
Cheap, fresh, well-prepared food, with a  surprisingly huge number of fast, efficient yet friendly counter staff, this place is a winner!"}
{"text":"Update on the samosa. Now it is $1 for 4 Veg samosa. The samosa is smooth, golden, doughy, light and not greasy at all. Although it is not what people think a samosa is (as noted by my friends), it's still delicious in its own right. If you would like a crunchier version of samosa, try the patice $1 for 3. It's crunchier as seen by the bubblier surface, but it is greasier, so beware. Overall, nice Indian neighbourhood take out place."}
{"text":"Went back 2 weeks ago and place was not what it was like before. Still cheap like really cheap...which could be the reason why the quality has gone down so much! I used to like their chicken bryani but now it just tastes bland. Chicken was dry. I feel sorry for the staff working so hard and late there. If they increase the price would the quality go back?"}
{"text":"Decent food, good prices, but after the initial taste it gets boring. 

The place isn't too bad, it is clean and well kept. The prices as I mentioned were reasonable and the quantity of the food was good. The quality was nothing too crazy, was pretty average. 

Overall, I would recommend this place to someone who wanted to try sri Lankan Tamil dishes."}
{"text":"So darn good! The food here is absolutely amazing, and makes you want to go back for more. 

The first thing you'll notice is the smell. Its heavenly and definitely makes you want to order everything! You can't sit down here, as it is a takeout establishment, but it is still worth it. 

Everything is quite good here, but the samosas are probably my favourite. Dishes here are typically quite spicy, so you will want to keep that in mind when ordering. 

The food comes out quite fast, so you really don't have to wait that long. The overall set up is a little confusing when it gets very busy, but it is what it is. 

Definitely an awesome place to pick up some food and head home! Check it out!"}
{"text":"I got the Chicken briyani here once, and have tried their samosas (veggie/mutton). The samosas are 4 for $1. The samosas weren't that good. I've also had better chicken briyani from other restaurants, but it was decent here. Fast service as they do take out only. Maybe I'll give the place another try and try another dish."}
{"text":"It's hard to go wrong with Babu.

My go to is their Masala Dosai. Super cheap for how filling it is, and its genuinely good food! The \"pita\" that it's wrapped in could do with some flavour, but the on-the-side sauces that it's served with, plus the hearty filling definitely pick up the slack.
Note: This is a south Asian restaurant, so beware if you're not up for a spicy experience.

And of course, there's nothing more satisfying than their mutton squares. God bless..."}
{"text":"I always feel sick after eating here. The food is so oily and salty... but I keep falling into the same routine of takeout and bathroom runs because it is so convenient and close to home. I never learn my lesson."}
{"text":"I've been too Babu quite a few times, and they've all been great! Everything is very flavourful, and it's huge portions for a great price. My fave dishes are the eggplant pickle (not too sweet, but just enough), the butter chicken (sauce is awesome), and the samosas. They have a great selection of entrees and deserts, and is great for party catering. The service is always helpful and attentive, plus on my birthday, they gave us a free dessert (amazing)! If you are buying for dinner, I recommend ordering the party dishes, which offers a wide variety of options based on a per person basis. The only thing is you have to order in the morning so they can make it. 

Overall, my fave cheap eats place with great service and selection.

Service 5/5
Food 4.5/5


However, be warned that I'm pretty sure they use trans fats to fry samosas, as I can't explain how cheap it is."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service. The people at the shop shall shoo you away without a second thought. The reported timing for the restaurant is till midnight, but the waiters out there start closing the place by 10 pm.

Even if you reach at 10.10 pm (like I did), they behaved very rudely and tell you to get out. The food was available, but still they will not entertain you. May be the owners need to take a note and set the timings straight for the place.

Misguided website and unprofessional staff. I shall always be away from this place from now."}
{"text":"$5 ALL DAY lunches on weekdays; $6 on weekends and it is SO worth it. They jam pack the box with food! You get to pick one rice, one meat, and three veggies from a variety of options.

One of the servers told me that their mutton curry is the spiciest, so if you like spicy food, give that a try! I've been here several times and have never ran into any problems with the food or service. They always have a handful of staff on hand - both at the counter and at the cash.

Samosas are four for a dollar!!

P.S. This place is takeout only, so there is no seating."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the cleanliness of the take-out restaurant is beyond wonderful. The smell of fresh Indian herbs and sweets enlightens anyone's day. The workers are helpful and knowledgeable of all their products. We bought chili chicken, butter chicken and rice dish. Then several samosas and finally sweets! They were all delicious and very flavorful. 

I was a little disappointed that their chili chicken was not as spicy as I thought. Overall, the food was great and the ambiance is very calming."}
{"text":"I bought mutton kotthu at Babu It was on saturday Night oct.1.2011.The mutton kotthu was really dry.not that much meat in their for the price I paid.no flavour at all.I didn't eat at all.The kotthu price way higher than other Srilankan restaurent.I bought Singerpore noodle on Sep 20.that was really bad too lots of egg less noodles.its looks like egg with noodles.Lots of egg mean I have no words how to explain.I through all noodles out.  I never go back again."}
{"text":"Friendly service, lots of selection and not very expensive. I recommend this place! I had all their curry.. Absolutely fantastic! The roti is good as well, especially when it's accompanied with the curry sauce."}
{"text":"Always enjoy ordering take out of curry beef here, b. chicken rice, and samosa.  
The smell is overpowering and wonderfully authentic. Great value under $7, even $6 for lunch specials. There's' always a lunch special for combo with and without rice."}
{"text":"Literally just now we tried to call for delivery and a man picked up and he said \"no delivery, only pick-up.\" We tried to tell him that his website is called babudelivery.com and that it says to call the following number for delivery. Even though we told him this he said no and he hung up on us. Worst service ever. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I walked in and saw directions for TWO doors, blue pill red pill scenario so I choose the left door which lead me inside closer towards the Drinks/Bakery/Snacks/Desserts which meant that I had took the LONG ROUTE having to walk back towards the right end where the Mains are.

I have to say I love the setup of this place even though there are no seating at all but everything here is DISPLAYED in under heat lamps or warming trays almost like a buffet/cafeteria.  There was clear glass separating the serving counters and the back KITCHEN so you can see everything that goes on in the open kitchen.

It's somewhat disorganized though as if you are actually at a T&T trying to order meat at the Meat Department and they IGNORE the numeric system as I walked behind others wondering where the line begins and which patron I'm suppose to be behind.  Actually it is exactly like ordering Meat/Fish at an Asian Grocery Store.

Many of the items no longer have name descriptions on them so a GROUP of Cantonese people were asking the staff EVERYTHING and ANYTHING, and I had to do it too but the staff didn't look enthusiastic at all and completely lacked expression which I didn't mind but to other patrons it might hit them the WRONG way.

Amazing value as I ordered a Tandoori Chicken Leg($2.95), 3pc Chicken Wing($1.25), 3pc Veg Samosa($0.99), Fish Patice($0.99), Ginger Beer($1.00).  The receipt even says WE PAY YOUR APPLICABLE TAX!  So what you see on the menu is what you pay.

Tandoori Chicken Leg was good with Tandoori flavour noticeable but maybe I'm used to Chicken Leg being juicy, its a take-out place so I'm just being picky I guess.  Wings tasted like a bit of Jamaican Jerk but it is definitely done in the Tandoor because it had a HOLE through each one.  

The Veg Samosa was OK too but its a bit mushy and soft on the inside as everything was mashed with less spices than I usually notice at other places, and also I like it when some places leave a piece or two of CHUNKY Potato as texture contrast.  That's just a personally preference until I get more Indian food in me.

The Fish Patice almost tasted the same as the Samosa, maybe they gave me Veg Patice instead and they might even have got it CONFUSED as there are no specific labels on that end of the counters.  

Ginger Beer was good and SPICY as it almost burned off my mouth and taste buds.  It definitely took all the other spices away from the food and it's as if I had Raw Garlic which I'm a fan of."}
{"text":"Good quality, consistently good food and service. Been here 4-5 times and have tried the kothu roti (spicy and wholesome!), biryani (the meat is juicy and  the rice was awesome), the tandoori chicken (not coloured as other restaurants... But very flavourful). And guess what - the food is cheap! The service and the entire setup is quick and efficient. The place is ALWAYS crowded... But you will be in and out in 10 min. 
One tip - the bread that they bake in-house is really really good!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I'm craving for biryani! This is a take-out location; no tables for sitting at. Lunch special from 11am-2pm includes one rice, one meat, and two veggies for $5.50. After 2pm, you can get the same for just a dollar more. What a steal! The biryani is deliciously spiced, and the meats and veggies are heavily sauced JUST the way I like it.

They also have a selection of small eats including mutton and veggie samosas, fish pattice, mutton roll, fish rolls, and a bunch of other things I have yet to try. The samosas can be hit or miss with freshness; sometimes crispy on the edges, sometimes chewier. The samosa's exterior isn't like many other samosas I've had in my experience. They're more bready. 
In the mutton and fish rolls, you'll often find a large half of an egg in them. Very flavourful, delicious combination of spices, very filling, and at only $1 a piece, you can have yourself a hearty carb-ful snack. Or a meal if you eat very little. 

In all the years I've been visiting this place, I've never had a bad experience. Staff are always ready to help you so you can be in and out in about five minutes!"}
{"text":"Food is Cheap...so is their Customer Service, their staff has no class. Had a small argument with their cashier..."}
{"text":"Excited, but confused. Checked their online menu as well as their in-store advertisement, and the prices didn't exactly correlate with their in-store specials.

Had:

Chicken biryani ($5.45) - Comes with 2 pieces of chicken, hardboiled egg, and some kind of yogurt salad. Biryani was flavorful. Portion was very generous (lasted me lunch and dinner). Chicken needs more flavor in order to stand up to the rice.

Lunch special ($5.99) - So online, they say that the lunch special is all day and it's $4.99. It is supposed to come with plain rice, 1 meat curry and 3 veggie curries. On their specials board, it was listed at $4.99 before 3pm, and after 3pm, it costs $5.99. It also comes with 2 veggie curries, and not 3. I was allowed to choose biryani rice though. Also a good portion. Butter chicken is tender and flavorful, and it's got a nice BBQ smokey taste to it. Mutter paneer could have used more paneer, but it was also tasty. Daal was not bad, but I prefered the paneer. 

Fish patice (3/$1) - This is almost like a crossbreed between a samosa and a dumpling. It's deep fried and quite tasty. A worthwhile treat. Slightly spicy.

Mutton samosa (4/$1) - Also quite tasty. Does have a mutton taste, but no actual meat texture. Curried mashed potato paste inside. Also slightly spicy.

Mutton roll ($3) - Quite similar to the mutton samosa, except with a few chunks of potato and a few pieces of actual mutton. Also in a roll that is presumably not deep fried. This one is also quite a bit spicier than the patice or the samosa.

The food was quite good. The portions were quite good. The prices were quite good. However, they need to work on their service. It was my first time there, and one of the servers accompanied me as I walked around the restaurant ordering things. Towards the end, when we were about to pay, another server told us to follow him to the cash register to pay. He had mistaken us (myself and my parents) for another couple that he had been serving. We ended up paying for their order, and we were almost given their food. Our original server then told us to follow him and he would sort it out. He berated us for not following him to pay. There is no visible system in place as to how to pay. He was there when the other server told us to follow him, but did not stop us. Not a fan of being berated for something I don't think was entirely my fault.

This location is a tad far for me, but there's a closer one, so I'll go there next time. Hopefully, their service issues get worked out."}

{"text":"I remember when Devan stumbled upon this gem. If you read his review you'll see he's all about Babu, and rightfully so.

What started out as a convenient lunch turned into a weekend addiction. Babu's had me coming back over and over and over.

I don't even want to try writing a review that incorporates something Devan's doesn't so I will refer you to his, and rate this place a 5/5 stars.

The below ideal order is copied from Devan's review and I strongly vouch for it:
-Veggie/Chicken/Beef/Mutton Kothu Roti (feeds 3 ppl, very spicy)
-Roast Mutton Curry (spicy)
-Butter Chicken
-Pakistani Biryani
-Chicken Tikka or Tandoori Chicken
-Naan

I also love the curried mushrooms, it is one of the hottest dishes I've ever had in my life!! This review is making me hungry. Guess where I'm going after work :) 

Babu's is a must try. Don't pass up this amazing food."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today despite living near the takeout place since it opened. So glad I went! Service was friendly and quick but I also came in around 12pm on a Sunday when there were only a couple other people ordering. We ordered a medium-sized butter chicken dish, small fried rice, roti, and jalebi. It was all soooo good! The medium-sized serving was enough to feed three people and we still had a bit left over from the small fried rice. The butter chicken was perfect - savoury, with a bit of spice and served nice and not too hot.  We really enjoyed how the sauce was made. The fried rice was good - reminded me of Chinese fried rice but with basmati rice instead of jasmine.  Roti was great - especially dipped in the butter chicken. It was our first time trying jalebi and we liked it! It's on the sweeter side of desserts so some might find it too sweet but delicious nonetheless. I definitely have to come back to try more of their dishes, sweets, and baked goods!"}
{"text":"Tasty Sri-Lankan takeout food at a reasonable price.  

Biryani is quite different from those of Indian takeouts like Silver Spoon. 

Just don't keep the veggie dishes in the fridge too long to avoid spoilage. It will be good if consumed within 2-3 days based on my experience."}
{"text":"Quality of food has definitely gone down over the years while prices have risen. If you are going to check it out, the chili chicken kothu roti is pretty good,  but the samosas and patties have gone down hill and the poori is way too thick and over fried to be edible."}
{"text":"Ate here several times.  Service is okay as can be expected at a fast food Indian restaurant.  Food is priced slightly higher than most of the same restaurant.  For the most part the food is okay at best.  However, this time I am writing a review on the toilet and let's just say it hasn't been the greatest 30 minutes my stomach and toilet has experienced."}
{"text":"Unfortunately these guys don't deliver. But they should make sure that they update their website and yelp space."}
{"text":"We came at 9:50pm to this location just before closing time. We ordered the veggie rice and 5 curries. The customer service has always been good to us. But two of the curries stunk really bad when we got home and we threw it out immediately. The other curries did not stink at the time, but in the middle of the night we ended up getting food poisoning. This is unacceptable. Seriously, are there no checks in curries and maximum time these curries can be out. Isn't there some sort of temperature control. I do not recommend this place because this is atrocious."}
{"text":"I love dropping in to this place to try some new (for me) Sri Lankan dishes. The prices are very low but everything I've ever tried here has been absolutely delicious. The only thing I don't recommend is the samosas. I've had better ones. These are small and the dough is not flaky or crisp the way I usually like it. 
Babu has a huge variety to choose from. The smell is great the moment you walk in the door and the people there are friendly and efficient. Even when there's a big line up, you get in and out of there quickly. If this place were a little closer to me, I be in there all the time."}
{"text":"Decent place for South Indian types of food. Great and different types of food. They have meals, appetizers, sweets, drinks and more. But I really love about this place is that you can get a whole Lotta food for a cheap price!! I got 4 spring rolls, 4 samosas, 2  bondas, and a lunch meal (which fills 2 people) for all $12!!! How amazing is that?! The food is a little heavy so it could fill you up really quickly but it's definitely not too spicy. 

They are super Organized with having two separate lines where one is for short eats and one is the regular line where you can get lunches and dinners. They also have other types of things such as bakery items: bread, Curry bun, patties, and more! 

All the veggie stuff is separated from the meat stuff which I liked a lot!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Babu! Tried the following for around $20~ A good and cheap alternative for takeout. 

Butter Chicken - tender pieces of chicken, mild/spicy/sour sauce

Tikka Masala - the texture of this is a bit more gritty than the other sauces. Spicy!!

Vegetable Curry - lots of mushrooms, Spicy!!

Tandoori Chicken Leg - only $3.50 i believe - such a big portion and cheap! Very fragrant grill flavor and moist chicken. 

Naan - soft and floury, like a pita but less dry. 

Samosas - inside is mashed potatoes and spices. I like the mildly spicy flavor, but there was no sauce. Good but not as 'wow' as A1 samosa I had a while ago. 

I wouldn't say the curries were unbearably spicy, but spicy enough to make my mouth on fire by the end of the meal!"}
{"text":"Great when I need my Sri Lankan food fix - hoppers, rich cake, fish rolls....they have it all. 

I really enjoy and recommend their curries and hoppers. I find the rolls / short eats hit or miss (not always the freshest)"}
{"text":"Love it!  Place is very clean.  Staff very friendly and will let you sample anything. Food is amazing with large portions and inexpensive.   I'll be back next time I'm in the area..

Great Indian restaurant, don't hesitate..!"}
{"text":"\"please don't let this place be your lasting memory of Indian food\" 

I always look for good Indian food. Markham has a large Indian population and I expected this to be with good and tasty given its fast food style concept Vs made to order almost. 

If you live anywhere in the area you'll notice the flyers they place in your mail about this place. Looks like good value, and good selection but when ordering take out from here I was less than impressed. Items were dry, flavourless, and made somewhat cheaply.

The samosas were tiny, and had nearly nothing in them. Also, they charge a premium for the food they sell, ordered a staple, butter chicken, and didn't get anything even resembling that as an order. It was a really spicy curry with 3 pieces of chicken. Not authentic indian at all.

Will I go here again? Sure if someone else is paying."}
{"text":"The best description of my experience would be that Babu is the fast food version of Indian food. There are plenty of ready-made food choices laid out under head lamps for you to choose from. Just point to what you want through the glass and it will be ladled out for you, bagged appropriately and a receipt number will be given to you to tell the cashier for payment. It is only for take out, there is no place to sit down so expect to grab your food and go somewhere else....like maybe your car. 

I would recommend the mutton curry if you like spice, and the paneer is always good choice also. If that isn't enough, pick up some veggie samosas at 4 pieces for $1. Their samosas are different than the usual, instead of the dough being fried to a hard crisp it retains more of a bread-like texture. Still delicious and well seasoned though. The only downside is that the none of food is hot enough (temperature wise), which is to be expected since the food isn't cooked fresh per order. So prepare of room temperature-ish food, or to heat it up yourself at home."}
{"text":"This was my first time at babu and I was impressed.  It was very clean inside and quite spacious for a takeout place.   Customer service was excellent and the food was good."}
{"text":"Tried to come here to g at 10pm and they were closed ): 
Despite getting food poisoning i still come here for the samosas once in a while because who am kidding, theyre delicious. The issue is they are never open to the hours that they claim to be open until, which is very annoying to find out upon arrival."}
{"text":"Food quality has decreased. They must have changed their way operating. Would only recommend to get their $1 for 5 samosas (only because it's cheap for a pot luck dish to bring to a party)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here regularly for the past 6 months, you cannot beat the lunch deal, 5$ for a huge plate of food! The mutton somosa's are great (4 for a dollar), if you get them hot out of the oven they are to die for! The guys are always super nice as well. The curry itself is average, if comparing to a traditional dine in experience; however considering its fast food, it's superb!

Some more combo's, and samples I would give the place a solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and got 2 mixed rice lunch combos ($5.45) and a milk hopper ($1). The total came out to $13, including tax, so highly affordable for 2 people. The combo came with biryani chicken rice, a choice of meat and 2 choices of vegetables. I chose the mutton as my meat and chose eggplant and spinach as my sides. For the other combo, we changed things up a bit and got chicken. I personally preferred the chicken over mutton. The mutton was more hard/dense. The flavour was good though. 

There wasn't much eggplant in my eggplant as 80% of it were onions, I was quite disappointed by that. The spinach was alright, it isn't how i would normally eat it and I found it to be too mushy. In the end, it was a lot of food and neither one of us were able to finish all of it. 

The hopper (appam) was like a crepe with this creamy coconut milk on the inside. It was my first time trying it and it was very good! I highly recommend. 

Service here was alright. The line moved quick, but they were a bit disorganized in the end as they lost our order number and weren't sure how much our order was. There was also a bit of a wait for our hopper. 

Overall, good food with large portions at an affordable price. I will come back to try their other menu items and for more hoppers!"}
{"text":"Came here at around 7 pm for 2 mixed lunch combos. It was very disappointing especially with som e of the good comments here at Yelp. Every thing tasted the same and were no different flavour to it. Never again."}
{"text":"As someone who is very familiar with Sri Lankan cuisine, I was very pleased with most of the items here.  Their curries etc often are a tad on the greasy side but their dry meats ( tandoori style roasted chicken) is excellent.

Great selections of rolls and buns.  Very cheaply prices and well made.  Fairly friendly staff"}
{"text":"Ode to babu!  This is one of the best places I have found in my hood.  First off the cleanliness is unbelievable...they have glass everywhere so everything from food to kitchen is visible to all who enter.  Secondly, the service...wow!  Just the friendliest bunch of ppl you will ever meet.  Not like a Chinese restaurant where you may be won over by price but with a serious doses of bad service with matching attitude...lol.  Thirdly, the price....just ridiculously inexpensive with the large and in charge portions.  But above all...the taste is just fantastic.  

Although there are sometimes no signs...the staff will always encourage you to try...and their sample size could get you full.  They aren't cheap.

Have yet to try their sweets but will definitely do it next time we are bk and have enough hands to carry it all out :)

Nom nom nom....babu rules!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food for cheap pricing.  Huge quantity and love the roti here.  The tandoori chicken leg is a bit dry, but the curries are great!  Good for take out dinner when you don't know what to cook that night."}
{"text":"Probably the shortest yet one of the most effective reviews I've written! The food here is fannnnnnnnnntastic! I love love love the samosas and 3 or 4 for $1..... game changer right there! So goooood the curry is so delicious you could eat like $10 worth not even joking! I don't even care that this place is a takeout place. I'll just order my food and eat in my car all day! I've also tried the lemon rice and yummmm. I've yet to try the other food as samosas are my life at babu. If I order other food I feel the samosas will be angry at me so samosas all day! 

Anyways the place smells like curry heaven and the other food looks amazing! Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"You can't really beat it for the price and variety they have!  The masala dosa was awesome!  The fish pattis and roti's I got however were a bit stale,  probably because they gave me an older batch.  I have yet to try much more on this menu."}
{"text":"My whole family absolutely loves this place.
I loved it so much, I hate it served on my 16th birthday so all my friends could try the wonderful mutton rolls and fish patties. 

Upon walking in, I love how the place is so organized and looks like a bakery more than a regular takeout place. They serve a lot of fresh bread and even drinks. It's also amazing how great this place looks inside (quite nice) but has a super low price point! Honestly, I would like to stock up a few of these things for my freezer.

Over the years, I've tried many different menu items. My very favourites include stuffed roti, fish patties, mutton rolls. 

However, I have noticed the quality to decrease. They change their recipes making the food not always consistently delicious. The most tragic was the changing of the fish patty wrappers. They used to be thin, like wonton wrappers and deep fried. Now, they are served in a thick, doughy wrapper that resembles a pizza pocket... I'm not even sure if its fried anymore. It looks completely different too since it is no longer bubbly looking. The new wrapper is too thick and takes away from the deliciously moist filling which also has less fish. 
Similarly, the mutton rolls also contain more potato. They used to have a lot more mutton!!! If the quality had not gone down, I would easily give this place a 5/5 review. 

Overall, I don't know of a better place that has it all (this place really is a one-stop shop) and at such a low price point. Therefore, this is a place I would continue going to and to try more menu items."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt, my favorite Indian place in Toronto. So affordable and so fresh."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Usually to pick up samosas, they have fish samosas too.
For the other items, i'm not familar with the food, so i usually look at all the dishes and then pick what i like.  Most are spicy. Prices are good! Somedays it does get busy.

No seating inside. Take out only.
Service as mentioned in other reviews, are hit and miss.

Worth a try if its your first time, at least you get to see what you are ordering, instead of pictures.

If it looks dry, don't order it."}
{"text":"We have been going to Babu for a long time and the quality has steadily decreased...today was the last straw. My hubby ordered dosa and instead of rice batter dosa we got wheat dosa! We live far away so didn't bother to drove back in. There have been incidents before where the food was spoiled or ordered had been mixed up and we have called and complained but nothing seems to have helped ... we will never go back here ! 
I would give 0 stars."}
{"text":"Love Babu. Been frequenting this location since it opened. Moved. Came back. Still love the chili chicken. The butter chicken done to perfection. Naan. I really should try other meats but chili and butter chicken - my faves. Also have the tandoori chicken. The sweets and baked goods look quite delectable. Must try one day."}
{"text":"Food is just ok. Everything is toned down to be boring and bland.  Unfortunately only a few other Sri Lankan options in the area. I prefer the longstanding shop a few kms south of here."}
{"text":"I've only ever eaten the samosas here - it's $2 for 4 pieces.  
They're actually huuuuuge.  I love the vegetable and mutton here.  The spices are so overwhelming - none of your gross, soggy, barely-tasting like anything kinda puffs. 

If you're coming here for the samosas - you have to be a little direct as there's usually 5 to 10 people milling around - you just go up to the counter (left side - where the samosas are) & order.  As everybody else is waiting for food on the right side."}
{"text":"Obviously you can't be expecting anything crazy authentic from this fast food/catering south Asian food joint. As such, you don't come here for a luxurious Indian cuisine; you come here because it's fast, available, and satisfying. Thus, Babu deserves 4/5 stars if that's what you're looking for. 

Babu does its job; everything is cheap, big potions, and delicious (though again, I can't say it's authentic). I like to get their all-day lunch specials which comes with a choice of meat and choice of 3 veggies. For the veggies, their pickled eggplant is a MUST! It's sweet and sour and really adds to whatever you're eating. I also get their veggie special which comes with 5 veggie sides (7 sides on fridays) and rice or roti; also very filling. I like their veggie sides more than their meat sides anyway; the butter chicken is not as good as it used to be but again....good enough for what you give. Their masala dosa is great too, samosas are satisfying, and their desserts are quite delicious, though more expensive than I'd like (desserts are paid by weight).

I frequent this place because it satisfies my Indian food/south Asian food cravings, it's super affordable, and it satisfies."}
{"text":"Continue to give it 5 stars. Their chickens are so flavorful and tender.

Garlic Chicken Tikka for 1.50 per piece of chicken is a bargain!

Not sure how they get the meats to be so juicy and soft. But I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"First time was good, because I was happy to find this so close to my place. Since then, the quality has gone way down. Greasy and stale. Worst is some of the counter service. One of the guys back there is just plain rude with a terrible attitude. 

Go if you are desperate. I'd rather go to McDonalds with a bottle of Tabasco."}
{"text":"Babu is another resturant for quick take meal. Prices are a couple dollars more than Silver Spoon. The curries are very well done to perfection. Samosas are tasty as well.

What I really enjoy eating on a regular basis is curry.  I've had chicken Biryani at Babu. A few times and couldn't take it anymore. The chicken was always not well done. So then I tried mutton Biryani. It was good the first few times and then one morning i ordered mutton Biryani and there was just so much onions in there i couldn't eat it...just really bad....

What I like:
Curries and samosas are amazing.

What i don't like
Biryani is not good."}
{"text":"Tasty, cheap, fast, many options. Babu is well known all over for their takeaway dining and low prices. A simple biryani rice, mutton, 2 veg takeaway box can last you two meals if you've got a normal appetite.  

Do you think you should also get 4 samosas for $1? 

Wrong.


You should get 40 samosas for $10!"}
{"text":"I went to Babu again and just love the lunch special. Butter chicken, veggies and rice lunch. That is what I ordered but you can choose from many different items. I saw hakka chicken, curry chicken, crab curry, chick peas... the list goes on... Its a good sized portion and very reasonably priced. As well you can order 15 samosas for $5!
Its all take out. The service is good and they are all very friendly."}
{"text":"Went back to Babu for cheap dinner options.. Sometimes you just want to veg out at home and eat in your PJ.

Got the Half Meal ($4.50) taxes in!! Yes the receipt said they pay the tax for us :).

Buttery Chicken with rice and veggie.

The Buttery Chicken so nice and spicy! Hmmmm Yummmm When I said spicy, trust me is spicy! :) 

The rice is the long grain rice, a little harder than the usual Chinese rice I have.. but I have to say it is perfect with the sauce!

BTW, why not 5 Star... My server was not too friendly, not too interested in my order..and just want to try to get rid of me! Not even a thank you or a smile...

But I will still be back just for the food!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with Babu recently. I used to have better experiences and better food previously. My recent visit wasn't so pleasant. 
Their queue system doesn't make any sense. I went to get some take out for dinner. I had to line up once to order food and line up again to pay at a separate line up. It took a really long time just to get take out (I was there for 20-25min and it wasn't even that busy at the time). They seemed to serve people who weren't even in the line-up, how is that fair to people who are waiting in line. 
Food quality seemed to be going downhill as well. 

Overall, cheap take-out, just okay quality food, slow service; took a long time to get food and q system didn't make sense. I don't think it's worth the hassle. Likely won't come back here anymore."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a speedy pace and decent price. Service, needs work. I would have given this place a 5 star but the guy who helped with my order just was not all there. I had to repeat the details several times and he still needed help keying it all. As I stood there taking this all in I had to wonder if it was his first day. When I saw him and another young staffer watching as a third more experienced staff took over helping a client who obviously knew her stuff. The young man helping me also needs a few lessons in salesmanship. When a new client comes in through your doors you want to do everything possible to make sure he comes back again. So, if you plan on going to this place, do some research first. They have a website which is very detailed. I went in there to find out that they did have butter and garlic Naan, I wished that my server had known."}
{"text":"I love getting take out from Babu if I'm having a night in. The food is inexpensive and delicious. It hits all the right spots when I'm craving something savoury with a strong flavour. Depending on what I get, my less than $10 order can last me multiple meals.

My go-to order used to be the chicken biryani but I realized the flavour wasn't as strong as I like. My favourites now are the chicken kothu roti or the chili chicken kothu roti. It's so SO tasty and full of flavour. I can share one between my boyfriend and I. If I'm eating it by myself, lasts for multiple meals! 

I do enjoy spicy food so I asked for medium once (I almost died) so definitely try the mild first! I also like to get the yogurt salad to go along with my meal.

The samosas and roti are also delicious. It can get busy in the evenings so I will usually call in advance to place my order right before I leave the house. I've been to Babu countless times and I've never had any issues. I would 100% recommend it. Try the chicken kothu roti!"}
